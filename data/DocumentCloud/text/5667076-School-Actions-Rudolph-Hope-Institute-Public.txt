At this time, I'm going to turn it over to
Cheryl Nevins, who is going to take us through a brief
presentation of the proposed action.
MS. NEVINS:

12

Thank you, Brian.

Welcome.

The overview of the legal process,

13

just to highlight a few key dates, on October 1st, CPS

14

published draft guidelines for school action.

15

December 1st, CPS proposed school actions and sent

16

notice letters and draft transition plans.

17

On

Final transition plans would be due after the

18

Board votes on the action.

19

action, final transition plans would be expected in the

20

spring.

21

If the Board approves the

January 2018 where we are now CPS is holding

22

the second of two community meetings, and there will be

23

one public hearing at the end of this month prior to any

24

recommendation to the Board.

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 8
1

February 2018 or later, CPS would make

2

recommendations to the Board regarding the proposed

3

action.

4

meeting or after.

5

The Board vote may occur at a February Board

Respect to the proposed school action,

6

co-location means two or more separate independent

7

schools with their own school leaders co-existing within

8

a Chicago public schooling facility.

9

So Rudolph Learning Center, currently located

10

at 110 North Paulina Street, would share space with

11

Hope Learning Academy in the Spaulding building at

12

1628 West Washington Boulevard.

13

In terms of the engagement and feedback to

14

date, we have heard from the Rudolph School community,

15

including parents, alum, LSC as well as staff members

16

recommending that Rudolph move from their current

17

building to locate with the Hope Learning Academy to

18

support its mission in fostering a safe and supportive

19

learning environment using evidence-based strategies for

20

its students and nurturing the development of the full

21

child to support the students in reaching their full

22

potential.

23

Reasons for the proposal:

24

Rudolph building is in very poor condition.

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 9
1

Hope Learning Academy at the Spaulding campus

2

has available space and updated facility features within

3

a multi-floor building.

4

The proposal would provide our students with

5

the most significant disability the access to the

6

typical school experience in a typical school

7

environment with opportunities to transition to and from

8

auxiliary classrooms, collaboration with typically

9

developing peers, the option to eat lunch with peers in

10

a designated Rudolph lunchroom, access to a private

11

meeting space for students and their families as well as

12

confidential space for nursing services.

13

Key facts and figures:

14

Rudolph curring serves Grades Pre-K through

15

fifth grade with a current enrollment as of 20th day

16

numbers at 92 students.

17

serves Grades K through fifth with a current enrollment

18

of 363 students, again, according to 20th day numbers.

19

Hope Learning Academy currently

Hope Learning Academy has capacity of over 1000

20

students, and there is more than sufficient space to

21

accommodate the combined Rudolph of and Hope School

22

enrollment.

23

Proposed agreements:

24

Hope would maintain exclusive use of the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 10
1

following spaces; lunchroom, gym and library, and both

2

schools would share the following spaces; meeting room,

3

auditorium, center garden as well as the main entrance

4

for the parents or visitors to either school.

5

The school will continue to collaborate rate

6

with their reading buddies and their social and

7

emotional learning.

8
9

Now I'm going to turn it over to Brian, and we
can start our public comments.

10
11

Thank you.
MR. METCALF:

Prior to beginning the public comment

12

section, what I want to do is make sure that we go over

13

a few rules that will help guide this particular

14

process.

15

So during public participation, each speaker

16

that has signed up to speak will have two minutes to

17

share their thoughts.

18

you would like to sign up, make sure that you do so at

19

the registration table, keeping in mind that we want you

20

to stick to your -- to the two-minute time limit.

21

So if you have not signed up and

You will get a warning at the one-minute mark,

22

when there are 30 seconds remaining and also when time

23

is up.

24

Speakers, we ask that when you approach the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 11
1

podium that you try not to move the microphone, but we

2

also want you to make sure that you state your name,

3

your first and last name, and spell it for us and speak

4

slowly so that our stenographer can capture the correct

5

spelling of your first and last name because, remember,

6

these items are going into public record.

7

And with that, we ask that, as you have done in

8

the past, that we allow the speaker the floor when

9

they're at the mic so that we can capture everything

10
11

that they are saying.
The meeting is scheduled to end at 8:00 p.m.,

12

and the comment period will last until the scheduled end

13

time of the meeting.

14

If there is time remaining after all the

15

registered speakers have spoken, we will allow

16

participants who have not yet registered to speak.

17

do so, these participants must first register at the

18

registration table.

19

speakers who have already spoken are able to comment

20

again if they so desire.

21

must register again in order to speak again.

22

To

If time remains after this, the

Additionally, these speakers

I want to make that on this floor that if

23

translation is needed, please notify this lovely lady

24

here (indicating) to make sure that we are providing the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 12

appropriate accommodations.

2

Finally, please make sure that you start your

3

remarks by giving your first and last name, spelling it,

4

and giving the -- giving your affiliation with either

5

Hope or Rudolph.

6

At this time I'd like to welcome the principal.

7

If you can stand for me, Holly Dacres, can you give her

8

a round of applause.

(Applause.)
MR. METCALF:

All right.

At this time I am going to

11

request that Speaker Numbers 2 through 10 approach the

12

microphone here, Speaker Numbers 2 through 10.

13

Please make sure that you state your name,

14

spell it for us and your affiliation with either Hope or

15

Rudolph.

Hope, which has educated individuals with

developmental disabilities and behavioral disorders for

13

more than 60 years, is a strong advocate for individuals

14

with disabilities, and our mission is one of inclusion,

15

but it is also one of safety.

16

We look forward to having a detailed plan sent

to us so that we can rest assured, knowing that our

students and the students of Wilma Rudolph can both get

I'm here tonight to advocate for our students

who cannot speak or advocate for themselves.

for our parents who are at home with their children,

many because they do not have access to proper

unimaginable.

I stand here tonight reminding you of a great

man whose birthday and legacy we celebrated this week,

"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."

Not having adequate space or updated facilities

experience.

6

It was a great

And I am fully in favor of the move.

I've been

7

around so long that I remember that for decades now

8

they've been talking about that facility being

9

inadequate.

So it's just wonderful that, finally,

10

something is going to be done so those kids can get the

11

best they need.

12

Now, I want to caution everybody that

13

co-location in the Chicago Public Schools doesn't always

14

work unless there's a good partnership.

15

Holly for a couple years, and I know Dana, we used to

16

work together, they are wonderful, sincere, caring

17

people, and I've met the principal here at Hope a couple

18

times a few years ago, a great guy.

19

Now, I know

I have no doubt in my mind that the co-location

20

is going to work because we have two caring groups of

21

people that want to work together, and I think the

22

concerns from Hope are very legitimate, and that all

23

should be worked out.

24

I also know the people at Rudolph, many of them

here in this room, incredibly dedicated, caring people

2

who want to do what's best for kids.

3

it wouldn't work.

4

So I can't say why

I just want to say one other thing.

I was on

5

this stage six years ago when they dedicated this

6

building.

7

the big force behind getting this school rehabbed.

9

to make an inclusive environment for students.

14

school.

9

contract school.

Our autonomy is in our schedule and

10

our curriculum.

Everything else we do is CPS policies

11

and procedures.

So we're fortunate to be able to run

12

this school with the support of Hope because their

13

vision of inclusion is, as Dick said, why this school

14

was opened and why this collaboration started back in

15

2009 so we're happy to continue it.

16

make that clear.

17

Hope is not a charter

We are a CPS public school.

We are a CPS

And I just want to

I'll talk a little bit about our collaboration.

18

Our students have been collaborating since 2010,

19

everything from us being invited over to their therapy

21

students, our students going over as reading buddies,

22

their students coming over to get exposure before they

these are questions and concerns that we would have

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 34

regardless of what school we were being asked to

co-share with.

3

The questions that arrive when co-locating are:

4

The lack of parking available for increased

number of staff.

6
7

Will this reduce or increase the facility costs
for Hope?

8

10

Hope's current facility needs are not being
met.
I think he pointed out last week like there's

11

lightbulbs that need to be changed, there's paint that's

12

peeling, there's toilets that don't work, et cetera.

13
14
15

Safety and security during arrival and dropoff,
particularly on Washington, Maple and Paulina Avenue.
Currently Hope students have to have recreation

16

time inside because we don't have a lot of outdoor

space, and due to lack of space, if there is a co-share,

18

where will Hope and Rudolph students be able to have

unanimously agree that all of our students deserve the

13

colleagues actually have mentioned some of the

14

socioemotional benefits of a co-facilitated situation in

15

which we have more exposure to diversity among our

16

students, but I would like to suggest that not only are

17

there benefits for our students in exposure to diversity

18

and different ideas, but this is an opportunity for our

19

two schools to co-exist in the space to motivate all of

20

us to be more adaptive, more innovative and more

21

creative in the realization of our joint purpose in

22

supporting the education of all of our students.

So that needs to be investigated.

If you've ever

looked at our handicapped parking spaces, and one of the

11

Rudolph families was a family last week, we were out

12

there, and I said, this really needs to be looked at,

13

they agreed.

14

plant things that can be fixed, they're not a problem

15

with people wanting this to happen.

There's a few things, they're physical

So I think that if CPS can sit down and answer

17

some of those questions for us, we can really make this

work.

And I promised I wouldn't go over this time.

Hello.

My name is Estella Johnson

This is more for the CPS staff.

about the benefits of Rudolph.

let's move, let's do what we got to do.

6

education so David can have a better education.

7

never as a patient want to feel that.

8

I'm loving it.

Yes,

But here's the

I feel that you guys are sacrificing Aaron's
And I

I don't hear anything about what is Aaron,

9

because I'm going to use her because she goes to Hope,

10

what is she getting out of this, what are the benefits

11

of her still being at Hope, what's the benefit of when

12

David comes over here, what is she going to get out of

13

this because she, being a family member of Hope, means

14

she gets suggest of what Hope gets.

15

Your presentation only showed what Wilma

16

Rudolph got.

17

go to the table and think about this, I want you to see

18

my daughter Aaron and think about my son David and say

19

we have two kids with a parent like me who is not

20

getting the benefit from their parents, and I want to

21

fight for both of my kids so what is Aaron going to get

22

out of this, what is the kids at Hope going to get out

23

of this, are we going to do expansion to sixth, seventh

24

eighth grade because you do have another school right

It didn't show what she got.

My name is Julian Ramirez, J-u-l-i-a-n

employEE. this is my sixth year at Rudolph.
And from a personal standpoint, working at

12

Rudolph has helped me change the trajectory of my life.

13

Rudolph gave me stability that I needed in my life to

14

provide for my family, be a good father and, most

15

importantly, give me a vision.

16

That being said, I want to help change the

17

trajectory of our students' lives and help them become

18

as independent as they possibly can be.

19

In order to do what is best for the kids, we

20

need proper space for that to happen.

21

parents need access to private leading areas.

22

students deserve the same spaces as other students do

23

such as access to an art room.

Good evening, Everybody.

My name is

It's S-a-n-d-r-a, Calderon,

C-a-l-d-e-r-o-n.

I am a CPS parent and employee for

8

21 years, with ten years spent across the street at

Wilma Rudolph.

10

I'd like to take a moment right here to quote

11

Dr. King since we just celebrated his day on the 15th.

12

And he had a dream of a nation that had a place at the

13

table for children of every race and room at the end for

14

every needy child.

15

With that being said, our students especially

16

should be able to be in the same place as typically

17

developing kids.

18

all students, but it would also give our kids positive

19

role models to emulate; hence, Aaron's mother here, who

20

Not only will it teach compassion for

MS. DAVIS:

Hi.

My name is Michelle Lowe Davis,

M-i-c-h-e-l-l-e L-o-w-e D-a-v-i-s.
My son started Hope about a year ago.

He is in

11

the second year here, and he's a second grader, and he

12

has thrived phenomenally at Hope.

13

As a parent on the parents' board, we often

14

talk about how we want changes to occur within our

15

family dynamic here at Hope, and we are all in agreement

16

on the parents' board as well as within the entire

17

facility of Hope and the family of Hope that this is

18

going to be a good transition for us or a good

19

amalgamation for us.

20

I've seen the students come from Wilma Rudolph,

21

and initially I had no idea that they were coming from

22

Wilma Rudolph.

23
24

I thought they went to school here.

So it goes to show you how accepting that Hope
has been from the beginning with having students from

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 44
1
2

Wilma Rudolph attend or walk through the doors of Hope.
Again, as a parent of a child who has autism

3

and who's on the autistic spectrum, I have done -- I've

4

done nothing but see great things come from Hope.

5

I do firmly believe that, with the amalgamation

6

of the students from Wilma Rudolph, we're not going to

7

see anything but greater things come.

8
9

The students at Hope are very accommodating to
students with special needs.

They're very helpful.

10

Last clear when we attended the Special Olympics, I had

11

a child come up to me and say, can I help Sebastian?

12

said, help him do what?

13

his hand and walk him to the bus.

14

to cry because that is the type of environment that Hope

15

fosters in our students here.

I

He said, I just want to hold
I literally was about

16

The second thing that we want to address as a

17

parents' board is, again, the transparency, and I know

18

that this is something that has been consistently being

19

brought up toward CPS, but it is a known fact that CPS

20

is not very transparent.

21

With that being said, we are seeking

22

transparency as it pertains, as one of the parents

23

brought up from Hope, is that we want to know what's in

24

it for us as well.

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 45
1

We are not looking to discount anything that

2

may not or may come for our amalgamation with Wilma

3

Rudolph, again, we think that it's a great thing,

4

however, we're also looking for what's in it for us.

5

We are looking to get sixth, seventh and eighth

6

grade.

7

for special needs children is a very difficult thing to

8

do, and so without a sixth graduated, we run the risk of

9

our children falling behind because they're running into

It's something that we all know that transition

10

opposition by not having those upper grades, they're

11

losing the familiarity of their location.

12

So I hope that this is something that will be

13

strongly taken into account when it comes down to

14

thinking about what it is that we need in terms of Hope

15

as well.
