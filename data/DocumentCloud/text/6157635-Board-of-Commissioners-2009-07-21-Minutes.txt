 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
AGREEMENT RENEWAL
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 14, 2009 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 05-43-628 with the law firm of
Linebarger, Goggan, Blair & Sampson, LLP (“Linebarger Goggan”), Chicago, Illinois, for the collection
of outstanding receivables; said renewal term shall be for the period of September 19, 2009 through
September 18, 2010. During the term of Linebarger Goggan’s contract, two using departments have
initiated collections of outstanding receivables through Linebarger Goggan, the Department of Revenue
and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System. In the Department of Revenue, Linebarger Goggan
has achieved a 64% recovery rate on cigarette tax collections and has collected over $1.2 million out of
the $1.8 million dollars referred on cigarette tax since January 2006; while collections in outstanding use
tax has generated over $300,000.00. While engaged at the Health System, Linebarger Goggan has
collected over $12 million dollars, manned customer service phone lines for patient accounting, processed
over 14,000 Limit of Liability applications for placed accounts, provided revenue cycle management
guidelines and collection practices and identified over 6,000 accounts with eligible insurance information.
Reason:

Linebarger Goggan's contract expires on September 18, 2009 and a one (1) year renewal is
requested while a broad based Request for Proposal ("RFP") for countywide collections
services is developed. During the renewal term, an RFP will be developed with the input of
the various offices of the separately elected officials to consolidate the County's collection
processes. In addition to the above, the Department of Revenue has begun to utilize
Linebarger Goggan to address a backlog in Use Tax accounts and it is anticipated that
additional collection services will be needed after the Administrative Hearings process is
completed.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contingency Fee Basis 25%. Contract period: September 19, 2009
through September 18, 2010.
_________________________
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved that the County Purchasing Agent
be authorized to renew the requested agreement. The motion carried unanimously.

Submitting a request from
PATRICIA LAZUKA, Village Administrator, Village of East Hazel Crest
Re:

No Cash Bid Request Package for the Village of East Hazel Crest

I respectfully submit for your approval the Village of East Hazel Crest’s request to acquire the following
vacant unimproved commercial property in an effort to increase tax revenues and development within
Village limits. The single parcel is identified with the Property Index Number (PIN) of:
VILLAGE OF EAST HAZEL CREST

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
The Village of East Hazel Crest has identified this parcel as a potential site for commercial redevelopment
and public roadway expansion. This parcel is immediately adjacent to a TIF district within the Village of
East Hazel Crest that is scheduled for development. The development is contingent upon approval from
Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) of a traffic signal at the intersection of 174th Street and
Halsted Street. IDOT requires that the roadway in the vicinity of the traffic light be widened which
requires additional right-of-way. This parcel would be necessary if the Village of East Hazel Crest is to
meet that requirement. East Hazel Crest is a small land locked community with a small business base.
This particular TIF is the only area of opportunity for economic development; therefore the installation of
traffic signal is crucial to our economic expansion; which means that in order to make it happen we need
additional right-or-way. This parcel will satisfy the right-of-way requirement.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will file for and maintain tax exempt status for the portion of the property
that will be used for public roadway and until a developer is located for any remainder.
There is no third party request, proposal or agreement by a developer, organization or other private party
for this no-cash bid request.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will retain the legal services of Hiskes, Dillner, O’Donnell, Marovich &
Lapp, LTD, attorneys for the Village, to obtain the tax deed and the Village will bear all legal and other
costs associated with acquisition of the parcel.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will also annually report to the Cook County Office of Economic
Development informing and updating the County as to the status of the parcel of property for five years or
until the intended development is completed, whichever comes last.

VILLAGE OF GLENWOOD - NO CASH BID REQUESTS

DEBORAH SIMS, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee
Submitting a request from
KERRY DURKIN, Village President, Village of Glenwood
Re:

No Cash Bid Request Package for the Village of Glenwood

Please accept this letter as the Village of Glenwood’s application to participate in the Cook County No
Cash Bid Program for the 2009 County Scavenger Sale for the parcel of property identified below:
VILLAGE OF GLENWOOD
PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER

VOLUME

32-09-201-023-0000

011

2218

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
This request package is for the one (1) Property Index Number (PIN) described above.
I believe that utilization of the County’s No Cash Bid Program is the only means by which this property
can be returned to the tax rolls. The above identified property consists of an industrial building that is
located within the Village of Glenwood’s industrial park. The building on this property has been vacant
for several years, is run down and is in need of environmental remediation. Other efforts to use the
County’s tax sale procedure to transfer this property to a user that will actually occupy the property, pay
taxes and create jobs have failed. This property was previously sold for delinquent taxes for the year 2002
and prior years (Certificate of Purchase No. 02-0000194). However, after the tax purchaser determined
that the property was in need of environmental remediation, this sale was vacated by a Court order dated
January 23, 2008. Submitted under Tab 1 is a copy of the January 23, 2008 court order that vacated the
tax sale of this property because the property contained “hazardous materials requiring removal under the
Illinois EPA and the U.S. EPA.”
Property taxes have not been paid on this property for many years. The title work submitted with this
package reflects that the taxes due for the first and second installments for the 2006 and 2007 taxes have
not been paid. The first installment for the 2008 taxes also remains unpaid. In addition, the submitted
January 23, 2008 court order vacating the 2002 tax sale as a sale in error obligates the County to
reimburse the prior tax purchaser all the taxes that it has paid. It is therefore appears that this property has
not contributed property tax revenue since at least 2002.
Statement of intended use.
The property described by the above PIN# 32-09-201-023-0000 consists of a single lot that is improved
with one large industrial building. The building has been vacant for many years. This property is located
in the Village’s industrial park and is also located within the Village’s existing Industrial Park Tax
Increment Financing District.
It is the Village of Glenwood’s desire to obtain title to this property through the County’s No Cash Bid
Program so that the environmental hazards on this property can be corrected. As a result of the hazardous
materials located on this property, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has scheduled
operations to remove the existing hazardous materials located in the tanks and exterior spill from the 55gallon drums. This work will not result in the property being deemed to be free from contamination.
After the United States Environmental Protection Agency completes this work, it is anticipated that a
more work will need to be done to assess the overall environmental condition of the property. In addition,
there will need to be repairs to the building and its roof before it could be considered as being a usable
piece of property. After the property has been returned to a usable condition, the Village intends to
transfer this property to an end user that will utilize the property, pay real estate taxes and create jobs.
At present, this property and its building represent the largest abandoned piece of vacant industrial
property that is located within the Village. Returning this property to a usable condition will greatly
impact the Village by creating much needed jobs and property tax revenue for the Village and all other
taxing bodies. If the Village does not act, this property will continue to deteriorate, remain a target for
vandals and not in any manner contribute to the welfare of the Village, the County and the local school
districts.

2219

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
Statement of Intent to file for tax-exempt status.
In the event this application is approved, it is the Village’s intent to file the necessary documents that are
required to obtain a tax-exempt status for the property. The Village will continue to maintain this tax
exempt status for the property until such time that the property can be transferred to a private owner that
will create jobs and return this property to the tax rolls.
Statement establishing the lack of a third party request.
Please be advised that the Village does not have agreements to convey the perfected tax deed for the
property to any developer, organization or other private party. The Village also has not entered into any
negotiations with any developer, organization, or other entity pertaining to this property. This Village is
pursing this project in order to revitalize the largest vacant industrial building that is located in the Village
of Glenwood. The Village’s is not acting on behalf of a any third party requestor.
Statement establishing the Village’s intent to retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all
legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcel through the tax deed process.
In the event this application is approved, the Village will retain legal counsel in order to obtain the tax
deed. It will be the Village responsibility to bear all legal and other costs that are necessary for its
acquisition of the property through the tax deed process.
Statement of intent to comply with the County’s reporting requirements.
The Village understands and agrees that it will need to comply with the reporting requirements of the
County’s No Cash Bid Ordinance. This will require the Village to submit No Cash Bid Reports on the
status of the parcel for the later of either five years or the completion of the development.

This request package is for the one (1) Property Index Number (PIN) described above.
The above property is a small, vacant, unimproved 20 foot by 65 foot parcel of property that is located in
area that was previously subdivided in the early 1970’s but never built. In total, the area where this parcel
is located includes 163 unimproved lots. All these unimproved 163 lots make up a rectangular area of
approximately 615 feet by 1,295 feet (18.28 acres). This area is located adjacent to and east of railroad
tracks. In the mid 1990’s the Village acquired title to all but 6 of the lots in this area through tax deeds
that were recorded as document numbers 94-471283 and 95-146723. The single lot that is the subject of
this application is surrounded on all sides by other lots that were acquired by the Village of Glenwood in
the mid 1990’s. This single lot is not improved and is not served by any roads or utilities.
Property taxes have not been paid on the subject property for many years. The title work enclosed with
this package reflects that the taxes have not been paid for this parcel since 1987.
Statement of intended use.
As stated above, the single lot that is the subject of this application is a small 20 foot by 65 foot
unimproved parcel that is surrounded by other lots that the Village acquired by tax deed in the mid 1990s.
The surrounding property that the Village already owns includes approximately 18 acres that is located
east of railroad tracks. The Village acquired these lots in the 1990s with the purpose of using them to
develop a Metra station that would serve a new commuter rail line using the adjacent railroad tracks.
The Village’s desire to develop this area with a Metra station and related parking is now becoming a
reality. The Village has been actively participating in the planning for a new commuter rail line that will
run on the railroad tracks that are adjacent to the area where the subject property is located. The Village
has been awarded a grant by the RTA for the purpose of performing the studies that are necessary for the
establishment of a commuter train station at this location. The study that has been funded by this RTA
grant is currently being performed.
It is the Village’s plan to utilize the lot that is the subject of this request as well as the other 18 acres of
property that it already owns in this area for the purpose of developing a new commuter rail station and
parking for the new commuter rail line that is being planned for the railroad tracks located adjacent to the
Village’s property. The development of this new station and railroad line would be a great asset to the
Village, result in additional jobs, spur additional economic development and result in a positive increase
in the Village’s property values.
Statement of Intent to file for tax-exempt status.
In the event this application is approved, it is the Village’s intent to file the necessary documents that are
required to obtain a tax-exempt status for the property. Since the project planned for the subject lot and
the surrounding area will be publicly owned, the Village will need to continue to maintain this tax exempt
status for the property.

2221

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
Statement establishing the lack of a third party request.
Please be advised that the Village does not have any agreements to convey the perfected tax deed for the
property to any developer, organization or other private party. The Village also has not entered into any
negotiations with any developer, organization, or other entity pertaining to this property. This Village is
pursuing this project in order to further its plans for the development of the subject lot and the
surrounding property it already owns for a new commuter rail station. The Village’s is not acting on
behalf of a any third party requestor.
Statement establishing the Village’s intent to retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all
legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcel through the tax deed process.
In the event this application is approved, the Village will retain legal counsel in order to obtain the tax
deed. It will be the Village responsibility to bear all legal and other costs that are necessary for its
acquisition of the property through the tax deed process.
Statement of intent to comply with the County’s reporting requirements.
The Village understands and agrees that it will need to comply with the reporting requirements of the
County’s No Cash Bid Ordinance. This will require the Village to submit No Cash Bid Reports on the
status of the parcel for the later of either five years or the completion of the development.

The property is currently abandoned and an eyesore to the community. The land is contaminated due to a
dry cleaning establishment that was formerly operating on the site. The Village intends to acquire this
property, designated as a "brownfield", in order to enter into a site remediation program for clean-up. The
Village must own it in order to clean it up and secure a "No Further Remediation" letter. Once the cleanup is done, the property will be offered for sale to a developer through a bid procurement process at fair
market value.
The Village will file for tax exempt status once acquired, and will maintain the tax exempt status until the
deed is conveyed to a developer. There is no third party request.
The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and will bear all legal and other costs
associated with the acquisition of the parcels. The Village agrees to submit to the Cook County Office of
Economic Development No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five (5) years or until
development is completed.

prominence in our community, but all deserving a final resting place in peace; and
2266

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
WHEREAS, the cemetery has great significance in the hearts and minds of African American citizens, as
the cemetery included the graves of many prominent African Americans in our city, county and nation;
and
WHEREAS, the owners, have failed to meet their obligation to properly operate the cemetery, including
failure to properly maintain graves, failure to properly supervise their managers and employees, and
failure to keep adequate records; and

the graves of many men, women and children, violating the laws of our State and the peace and memory
of the many buried at the site, in an effort to achieve financial gain; and
WHEREAS, the Office of the Cook County Sheriff has spearheaded and actively engaged in the
investigation of these acts, in cooperation and with the assistance of various offices of Cook County

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ORDERING THE COOK COUNTY BUREAU OF HUMAN RESOURCES
TO IMPLEMENT RECOGNITION OF DOCTORS COUNCIL SEIU
AT STROGER HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY AND RELATED FACILITIES
WHEREAS, on March 31st the Service Employees International Union Local 20 (“Doctors Council
SEIU”) filed a Majority Interest Petition (“MIP”) with the Illinois Labor Relations Board ("ILRB") for
the physicians, dentists, podiatrists, and psychologists employed by the County of Cook at the John H.
Stroger, Jr. Hospital and related facilities (hereinafter “employees”); and
2267

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
WHEREAS, the MIP was accompanied by the signatures of a majority of employees in the petitioned-for
units; and
WHEREAS, physicians and dentists at Provident Hospital of Cook County, the Ambulatory Community
Health Network, Cermak Health Services of Cook County and Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County are
currently represented by Doctors Council SEIU, which is a part of a national union of doctors, and have
an enforceable collective bargaining agreement; and
WHEREAS, Section 1210 of the Illinois Administrative Code, governing the ILRB pursuant to the
Illinois Labor Relations Act (5 ILCS 315/1, et seq. [the “Act”]), delineates the exclusive means by which
a public employer may recognize a labor organization as the bargaining representative for a specific
group of employees; and
WHEREAS, a labor organization seeking to be recognized as the representative for a proposed
bargaining unit which is currently unrepresented by another labor organization may: 1) request that the
employer voluntarily recognize it; or 2) file a representation petition with the ILRB under Section
1210.20(a) of the Act. In response, the employer may 1) agree to the voluntary recognition procedures
provided in the Act (Section 1210.160); 2) consent to a representation election; or 3) decline to respond to
the request; and
WHEREAS, on June 19, 2009, the Executive Director of the ILRB entered an Order and Direction of
Representation in a case entitled County of Cook and Cook County Health and Hospitals System and
Chicago Joint Board, Local 200, RWDSU-UFCW, No. L-RC-09-012, involving administrative assistants
at Provident Hospital of Cook County. In this order, the Executive Director determined that Cook County
is the sole employer of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (“the CCHHS”) employees with the
authority to recognize a bargaining unit such as Doctors Council SEIU; and
WHEREAS, although both the County and the Cook County Health & Hospitals System have filed an
appeal seeking to overturn the Executive Director’s order, if the ILRB upholds the Executive Director’s
order, any future matters involving CCHHS employees would likewise be considered as if the County
were the sole employer; and
WHEREAS, contrary to the decision of the ILRB, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office ("CCSAO")
has concluded that the County and the CCHHS should be considered joint employers, who share or codetermine matters governing essential terms and conditions of employment, including recognizing
Doctors Council SEIU; and
WHEREAS, neither the ILRB nor the CCSAO have determined that CCHHS is the sole employer of
CCHHS employees with the sole authority to refuse recognition of Doctors Council SEIU.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that pursuant to the procedure by which a public employer
may recognize a labor organization under the Act, and pursuant to its authority as a sole employer as
determined by the ILRB, and pursuant to its authority as a joint employer as determined by the CCSAO,
the Cook County Board of Commissioners, in the interests of fairness and equal opportunity, hereby
recognizes Doctors Council SEIU for employees in the petitioned-for unit; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that pursuant to its authority as a sole employer of CCHHS employees,
the Cook County Board of Commissioners orders the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources to take
immediate action to implement this recognition, including prompt action to begin collective bargaining
with the doctors within thirty (30) calendar days of this Order, and pursuant to its authority as a joint
employer the County Board supports the same action previously stated and requests that the CCHHS act
in concert; and

CONSORTIUM AGREEMENT WITH THE CHICAGO METROPOLITAN AREA
FOR PLANNING (CMAP), LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NON-PROFITS.
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 1, 2009 from Todd H. Stroger, President, Cook
County Board of Commissioners:
Re: Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP2)
I respectfully request approval for Cook County, Illinois to enter into a Consortium
Agreement with the Chicago Metropolitan Area for Planning (CMAP), local governments
and non-profits for the purpose of applying to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) for the competitive application round of the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program known as NSP2. This round of funding is made available under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
When the ARRA was enacted, CMAP convened a group of counties, municipalities and nonprofit organizations in the Chicago region to discuss the advantages of applying for NSP2
funding on a regional basis. Out of these discussions, a number of these local governments
and non-profits have joined a consortium for the purpose of developing a regional strategy for
deployment of NSP2 funds. I recommend that Cook County join this consortium, as it offers
the strongest possible application for these competitively awarded funds. The NSP2 funds
will be directed to stabilizing neighborhoods whose viability has been and continues to be

2341

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
damaged by the economic effects of foreclosed and abandoned properties. I recommend that
Cook County join this consortium for purposes of joint application and funding among the
members, as it will make northeastern Illinois more competitive for NSP2 dollars and will
allow the region to create efficiencies and build economies of scale when implementing the
program. While CMAP will be the lead agency when applying for NSP2 funds, program
implementation will rest solely with the County of Cook, relative to its geographical
boundaries.
I respectfully request approval for the County to join the consortium in pursuing these
available federal funds and that I, or the Chief of the Bureau of Capital, Planning and
Facilities Management or his designee, is authorized to execute on behalf of the County of
Cook, the Consortium Agreement, to be effective as of July 13, 2009, and any and all
additional documents necessary further the activity approved herein. The approval of this
agreement by this Honorable Body will permit staff to execute the necessary documentation
to move this application forward.

INFORMATION STRATEGIES, INC. (PROPOSED CONTRACT). Transmitting a
Communication, dated June 30, 2009 from Joseph M. Fratto, Chief of Staff and Interim Chief
Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a professional services
agreement with Information Strategies, Inc., Washington, D.C. (in partnership with
Microsoft), to implement the Microsoft Stimulus 360 Solution to properly track, monitor and
report on the County’s programs funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
(ARRA).
Reason:

ARRA funds are intended to be utilized “as quickly as possible consistent with
prudent management.” ARRA funds require very stringent monitoring and
reporting of expenditures and results. The Microsoft Stimulus 360 Solution
provides the most complete tracking and reporting package for ARRA funds, and
can be implemented within 2 to 4 weeks of contract execution, due to the existing
relationship between Information Strategies, Inc. and Microsoft. This package
has been selected by the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago, in addition to
many other governmental entities nationwide for the efficient and proper
managing of ARRA funds, and using it will enable the County to work more
efficiently with the State to assure compliance with federal requirements.

This contract is in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Joint Purchasing
Requirement. The City of Chicago obtained competitive proposals from three firms and
selected Information Strategies, Inc. as offering the best combination of price and speed to
implementation.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
HOME RULE COUNTY RETAILERS’ OCCUPATION TAX
WHEREAS, County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, while other taxing districts within Cook County have consistently increased
their property tax levy on an annual basis, Cook County has not increased its property tax
levy since 1996 and the levy has remained constant at $720 million; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to streamline County government and prevent further economic
hardship on County residents, the Cook County Board of Commissioners implemented
budgetary cuts in the 2007 fiscal year with an on average seventeen percent (17%)
countywide budgetary reduction; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has a structural deficit and due to County Board approved
appropriations and contractual obligations, the Board of Cook County Commissioners
acknowledged the need for additional revenue and increased County revenue in a manner that
would afford adequate funding to maintain essential services; and
WHEREAS, as a home rule county, County of Cook is authorized by 55 ILCS 5/5-1006 to
impose a tax upon all persons in Cook County engaged in the business of selling tangible
personal property; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to address its fiscal responsibilities, effective July 1, 2008, Cook
County increased the tax imposed pursuant to this Home Rule County Retailers’ Occupation
Tax Ordinance by one percent (1%) excluding vital goods such as groceries and medicines as
well as vehicles and other titled property; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board’s increase to this Home Rule County Retailers’

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
WHEREAS, the increase to the Home Rule County Retailers’ Occupation Tax Ordinance
was considered and approved by the Board of Commissioners in order to prevent the
elimination of vital County services; and
WHEREAS, Cook County now anticipates additional revenue as a result of the federal

portion of the County’s budget and as a result believes that it would be fiscally prudent to
reduce the increased portion of the Home Rule County Retailers’ Occupation Tax by a
quarter percent (.25%); and
WHEREAS, in addition, on April 7, 2009, a number of Townships had a question regarding
Cook County’s increased sales tax, those Townships voiced their concern and though such
referenda is advisory in nature and not binding, it is good public policy to provide that the
opinions of the voters be acknowledged and heard; and
WHEREAS, reductions greater than a quarter percent (.25%) at this time may
disproportionately affect public safety and the health system, causing layoffs in offices that
include the Sheriff, State’s Attorney, Public Defender, Chief Judge, Clerk of the Circuit Court
and the Cook County Health and Hospital System; and
WHEREAS, a reduction in the increased portion of the Home Rule County Retailers’
Occupation Tax is proposed at a quarter percent (.25%).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice

Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
301186

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated April 24, 2009:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with TENG &
ASSOCIATES, INC., Chicago, Illinois, for the Sheriff's Video Camera & Recording
Systems Project.
Reason:

This project consists of the design of a high quality video camera and
recording system at the Department of Corrections, Markham, Maywood,
Skokie, Bridgeview and Rolling Meadows Courthouses, Criminal Courts
Building and the Criminal Courts Administration Building. Also included is
the replacement of the existing Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) System at
the Medical Examiner's Office.

The system will utilize high-resolution color cameras with approximately 1,060 new
camera locations.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved approval of Communication No.
301186. The motion carried unanimously.
301187

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated May 27, 2009:
transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 1 in the amount of
$79,243.00 to the contract with DELTA ENGINEERING, INC., Chicago, Illinois, for
the HVAC upgrade of Buildings 3 and 4 at the Department of Corrections, South
Campus. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This change order is to design a metal security ceiling in South Campus
Buildings 3 and 4. Though this is a minimum security facility, inmates are
still housed in these buildings and security is of utmost importance. With the
installation of HVAC ductwork, the possibility of hiding objects is too great,
therefore the installation of a metal security ceiling is recommended.

transmitting a Communication, dated June 8, 2009:

2372

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 1 in the amount of
$2,515,950.00 to the contract with ROULA ASSOCIATES ARCHITECTS, Chicago,
Illinois, Architect for the New Residential Treatment Unit (RTU) and Reception
Classification Diagnostic Center (RCDC) Project at the Department of Corrections. It is
respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

During the programming phase, it was determined that the using agencies
required additional square footage to meet their needs and to address specific
requirements of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) report on conditions
at Cook County Jail. In response to that report, modifications were made to
the original program. This will require a significantly increased design effort
on the part of the Architectural and Engineering (A/E) team. Additional
program elements and space are required, which translates into additional
project costs. Some of these program requirements include increased
hardening of the facility, additional security glazing to increase visual
supervision, body scanners to reduce strip searches, and the inclusion of a
pneumatic tube system to improve efficiency of medication delivery.

In addition, the original site had to be changed so that the new building would be adjacent
to Cermak Health Services of Cook County. This will decrease detainee transport
distance to assigned divisions, allow for reduced redundancy in the new building and
better staff efficiency. Surveys of the new site confirmed additional underground utilities,
which must be relocated and will require additional design effort. Also, due to the
proximity of the new site to existing buildings, increased construction phasing and
protection of adjacent foundations must be designed.
The overall project budget was increased during the Capital Improvement Program
hearings and the A/E fee adjustment is recommended due to that increase.
This is categorized as a Public Safety Capital Project.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO SECTION 30-387 OPEN BURNING
WHEREAS, the American Lung Association assigned Cook County a failing grade for
air quality in its State of the Air 2006 report, citing dangerously high levels of both
particle and ozone pollution; and
WHEREAS, approximately one million of Cook County’s 5.3 million residents have
been diagnosed with asthma, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
emphysema, or other lung diseases exacerbated by air pollution; and
WHEREAS, the open burning of domicile waste, also known as household trash, can
produce carcinogenic compounds and carbon monoxide, which, at even low levels of
exposure, can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including headache, fatigue,
nausea, and vomiting; and
WHEREAS, the open burning of landscape waste also produces air pollution and smoke
that can make breathing difficult for people with asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis,
allergies, and other conditions; and
WHEREAS, residents of unincorporated Cook County are required to contract for
regular trash collection, rendering unnecessary the practice of burning domicile waste;
and
WHEREAS, all Cook County municipalities but one have already banned the open
burning of leaves; and
WHEREAS, there are alternatives to the burning of landscape waste, most notably
mulching and composting.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
(b)
The Cook County Department of Environmental Control
(“Department”) may deny an application for the issuance, transfer, or renewal of
an air pollution operating permit if any air pollution site fee owed by the
applicant has not been paid within 60 days of the due date, unless the applicant,
at the time of application, pays to the Department in advance the air pollution site
fee for the site that is the subject of the operating permit, plus any other air
pollution site fees then owed by the applicant. The denial of an air pollution
operating permit for failure to pay an air pollution site fee shall be subject to
review by the County Environmental Control Board of Appeals pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 30, Article II, Division 4. Section 30-123 of the Counties
Code.
(c)
If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control
determines that an owner or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely

permit fees, the Department may collect the avoided permit fees with or without
pursuing enforcement. The avoided permit fees shall be calculated as double the
amount that would have been owed had a permit been timely obtained. Fees
collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the Cook County
Environmental Management Fund
(d)
If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control
determines that an owner or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely
obtain an air pollution operating permit and as a result avoided the payment of
permit fees, an enforcement action may be brought. In addition to any other
relief that may be obtained as part of this action, the Cook County Department of
Environmental Control may seek to recover the avoided permit fees. The avoided
permit fees shall be calculated as double the amount that would have been owed
had a permit been timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this subsection (d)
shall be deposited into the Cook County General Fund.
(e)
If a Permittee subject to a fee under this Section fails to pay the
fee within 90 days of its due date, or makes the fee payment from an account
with insufficient funds to cover the amount of the fee payment, the Department
shall notify the Permittee of the failure to pay the fee. If the Permittee fails to pay
the fee within 60 days after such notification, the Department may, by written
notice, immediately revoke the air pollution operating permit. Failure of the
Cook County Department of Environmental Control to notify the Permittee of
failure to pay a fee due under this Section, or the payment of the fee from an
account with insufficient funds to cover the amount of the fee payment, does not
excuse or alter the duty of the Permittee to comply with the provisions of this
Section.
Section 30-397.
Emission Levels Reduction. Permit Holders for sites
where the levels of pollution emissions exceed 100 tons per year of cumulative
regulated air pollutants shall be required to submit an annual “Regulated Air
Pollutant Emission Reduction Plan” to the Cook County Department of

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE WILLIAM M. BEAVERS, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
RESOLUTION PROPOSING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CARBON DIOXIDE REDUCTION PROGRAMS
FOR COOK COUNTY BUILDINGS
WHEREAS, there is a consensus among the world's leading scientists that global warming caused by
human emission of greenhouse gases is among the most significant problems facing the world today; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that commercial and
industrial buildings are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the national emissions of greenhouse gases
that contribute to global climate change; and
WHEREAS, the USEPA estimated that if the energy efficiency of commercial and industrial buildings in
the U.S. improved 10 percent, Americans would save an estimate $20 billion and reduce greenhouse
gases equal to emission from about 30 million vehicles; and
WHEREAS, the President and the Board of Commissioners have shown environmental accountability by
recently approving resolutions in support of membership in the Chicago Climate Exchange and support of
the Robbins Community Power bio-mass power plant; and
WHEREAS, President Todd H. Stroger sponsored and passed a resolution, in July 2007, to support Cook
County founding membership in the Sierra Club Cool Counties Climate Stabilization Declaration, which
challenges counties to create an inventory of our county government (operational) greenhouse gas
(“GHG”) emissions and implement policies, programs and operations to achieve significant, measurable
and sustainable reduction of those operational GHG emissions to help contribute to the regional reduction
targets; and
WHEREAS, the President and the Board of Commissioners recently approved The Cook County Climate
Change Mitigation Act, sponsored by Commissioner Quigley, which requires Cook County, on January 1,
2009, to enter into a legally and financially binding agreement with Phase II of the Chicago Climate
Exchange CCX, committing to a reduction of 1.5 percent of its total greenhouse gas emissions from the
buildings and vehicles Cook County operates, equaling each year between 2006 and 2010; and

2384

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
WHEREAS, once Cook County joins the Chicago Climate Exchange, Cook County will be required to
pay the Chicago Climate Exchange noncompliance fees for lack of meeting the required yearly CO2
reductions of approximately 4053 metric tons of CO2 for the FY 2007 and FY 2008 estimated at
$110,000.00 for both years within 90 days of signing the formal agreement and approximately $70,000.00
yearly until FY 2010; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Environmental Control has began the process of
addressing its future commitments to Cool Counties Climate Stabilization Declaration and Chicago
Climate Exchange by actively pursuing federal and state funding for implementation of new
environmental programs, including a pending award from the USEPA for a Diesel Vehicle Retrofit
Program to reduce the CO2 emissions from diesel vehicles in the Cook County Highway Department; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Environmental Control, in a collaborative effort with the
Bureau of Administration’s Department of Industrial Engineering, the Office of Capital Planning and
Policy, the Sheriff’s Office, the Bureau of Health Services and the Purchasing Department, recently
developed a Request of Qualifications and received submittals from Energy Service Contractors (ESCo)
that would be able to guarantee results reducing Cook County’s CO2 emissions and energy expenditures
from Cook County largest facilities; and
WHEREAS, guaranteed energy saving programs have been implemented for counties and cities across
the United States, by ESCos, by implementing energy efficiency retrofit programs utilizing EnergyStar
supported products and the use of renewable and sustainable energy technologies. Implementation of
these energy efficiency programs has been able to reduce utility cost by hundreds of thousands of dollars
yearly for the customers of ESCos; and
WHEREAS, ESCo will identify and evaluate energy-saving opportunities with an industrial energy audit
of Cook County facilities and then recommend a package of improvements to be paid for through savings.
The ESCo will guarantee that savings meet or exceed annual payments to cover all project costs usually
over the contract term. In the event the savings do not materialize, the ESCo pays the difference.
WHEREAS, the President and the Board of Commissioners appreciates the need to assess each energy
efficiency and carbon dioxide reduction initiative in an effort to: 1) determine the fiscal, personnel, and
operational impact on the using department or agency affected by the initiative; 2) determine whether
fiscal, personnel, and operational resources exist for implementation of said proposed initiative; and, 3)
conduct a cost-benefit-analysis of the initiative so as to determine whether the initiative can be sustained
monetarily and to determine the risks, i.e., noncompliance fees as above, associated with a decision to not
implement said initiative.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners support the pending
Energy and Emission Reduction Request for Proposals and pending contracts that will generate
deliverables that will benefit Cook County by:

amended Chapter 32 Fees, Section 32-1, Chapter 30, Environment on February 21, 2007

incorrectly classified; includes Section 30-97(3)c which was missing altogether; includes
a category that was missing in Section 30-97(5) for the air flow rate of devices or
apparatus used to control air pollution and corrects language at the beginning of Section
30-98(1).
Additionally, the amendment offered includes Section 30-600 which should be added to
reinstate the Open Burning Fee Schedule, which was inadvertently omitted during the
codification process and Section 30-96(1) should be changed to remove the reference of
Open Burning from the Installation Permit Fee Schedule.

and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board recognizes the tremendous economic challenges
facing the State of Illinois and the nation, we also recognize that there has to be revenue

2397

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
WHEREAS, we feel that the proposed revenue projection from video poker does not
provide a solid revenue stream for capital bonds proposed in the State budget; and
WHEREAS, the proposed Video Poker Bill which does not fall under the purview of
regulations and monitoring of the Illinois Gaming Act raises serious questions as to the
fiscal impact upon local units of government to enforce any unlawful acts or behavior
rising out of the operation or customers utilization of such gaming machines; and
WHEREAS, the portion of money that is estimated to go to County government is
questionable as to meet the additional financial need to ensure law and order; and
WHEREAS, there is no responsibility for the treatment of those who may become
addicted to such machines also poses additional health cost to and already overburdened
health system.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioner call upon the Governor and the leadership of both houses of the
General Assembly to reevaluate the negative consequences of unregulated or monitored
video gambling before moving forward on signing such Act into law.

CONTRACTS

EARL L. DUNLAP, Transitional Administrator, Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Chicago Uniform
Company, Chicago, Illinois, for purchase of staff uniforms and other accessories for employees. These

workers, laundry workers and cooks are entitled to an annual uniform allowance.
Reason:

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator, 99 C
3945 Doe v. Cook County, the Office of the Transitional Administrator instituted a new
uniform policy in fiscal year 2008 for Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC)

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 26, 2009 from
EARL L. DUNLAP, Transitional Administrator, Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Derby Industries, South
Bend, Indiana, for the purchase of mattresses.
Reason:

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the agreed order appointing a transitional administrator, 99 C 3945
Doe v. Cook County, the Office of the Transitional Administrator, in its authority as
established by the Court Order entered on August 14, 2007, is selecting Derby Industries as
the sole-source vendor for institutional mattresses. Derby Industries will provide durable
mattresses for use by the residents. Currently residents at the JTDC are destroying the
mattresses that have historically been used at the facility. In addition, these mattresses pose
health risks, as the residents can use some of the materials from the mattresses as weapons,
which could cause harm to other residents and employees of the JTDC. Additionally, the
residents have torn the mattresses in order to conceal contraband and other unauthorized items
in their rooms. The Derby mattresses have been piloted on several of the living units at the
JTDC and have been proven to be virtually indestructible. The purchase of these mattresses
will result in a cost savings for the JTDC, as mattress purchases will be reduced due to the
durability of the Derby mattress. Other mattress companies have provided product samples
for use at the JTDC in addition to Derby Industries, and none of their products were as
durable as the Derby mattress.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $175,000.00. Contract period: August 1, 2009 through July 31, 2010. (569333 Account). Requisition No. 95690068.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 21, 2009
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
TO RESTORE LOCAL HEALTH PROTECTION GRANT FUNDS
FOR ILLINOIS COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS
WHEREAS, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has eliminated funding for Local Health
Protection Grants in their FY 2010 proposed budget; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health receives approximately $2 million annually
from this grant to fund its core mandated public health programs; namely, investigation and control of
communicable diseases, including sexually transmitted diseases, and the administration of immunizations
and environmental health regulatory programs including but not limited to retail food sanitation
inspections, swimming pool inspections, and the regulation of private sewage disposal systems; and
WHEREAS, the termination of the Local Health Protection Grant will adversely, and potentially
irreparably, diminish the capacity of the Cook County Department of Public Health to perform these
critical functions and to respond to public health emergencies; and
WHEREAS, the termination of the Local Health Protection Grant will further adversely affect the ability
of the Cook County Department of Public Health to respond to the Influenza Type A H1N1 pandemic
making the timing of the elimination of the grant particularly unwise; and
WHEREAS, it is the belief that the elimination of the Local Health Protection Grant is very shortsighted
and it will likely result in great hardship, expense, and threat to life and health as a result of the inability
to perform these core functions as powers and duties delegated to certified local health departments by the
Illinois Department of Public Health.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests the
Illinois General Assembly and Governor Patrick Quinn to immediately restore funding for the Local
Health Protection Grant in the proposed FY 2010 IDPH budget and that the Cook County Department of
Public Health forward a copy of this resolution to each member of the Illinois General Assembly
representing citizens of Cook County and to Governor Quinn for their consideration.

(“Tenant”) for space located at 64 West 162nd Street, South Holland, Illinois which is utilized by the
Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) as a public health dental center.
The Cook County Board of Commissioners (“Board”) approved a first amendment to lease which

amendment to the lease further extending the term of this lease through January 31, 2014 at the meeting
of April 15, 2009.
CCDPH has communicated to this office that it will be relocating CCDPH staff currently assigned to this
location and that a non-governmental provider will operate a federally qualified health center (FQHC),
which will include dental services, at this location in the future. This arrangement requires that the
CCDPH transfer certain furnishings and equipment some of which is affixed to the premises. Under these
circumstances, the landlord is willing to waive the 180 day written notice requirement for termination of
this lease and allow the County to terminate the lease as of June 30, 2009.

by
MICHELE V. LATZ, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State’s Attorney’s Office
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with the Village of Homewood,
Homewood, Illinois. This contract will facilitate the “Project Reclaim” initiative administered by the
Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office and the Cook County Judicial Advisory Council. Project Reclaim
provides an alternative response to issues of youth who are involved in drug offenses, gun violence, and
communities victimized by these youth. This contract is fully funded by the Juvenile Accountability
Block Grant.
Reason:

The Village of Homewood is a grant partner for the Project Reclaim grant approved by the
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) and by this Board. The Homewood
Flossmoor Peer Jury Program is a juvenile diversion program which operates under the
auspices of the Homewood and Flossmoor Police Departments. The purpose of this program
is to address the balanced and restorative justice approach to juvenile crime by emphasizing
the issues of accountability, competency development and community safety. The goal of the
Homewood Flossmoor Peer Jury program is to provide a viable alternative to court
prosecution and conflict resolution for first time or early juvenile offenders in the south
suburban area and thereby reducing recidivism, and relieving the court system of cases that
could be more effectively resolved through an alternative dispute resolution process, such as
peer jury. The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office identified areas in need of service
across Cook County by evaluating police and Juvenile Enterprise Management System
(GEMS) reports as well as reports generated through computer mapping of juvenile crime.
One of those areas identified was the Homewood/Flossmoor area. The Village of Homewood
because of its understanding of the area, will be able to provide all necessary resources to
ensure all grant goals are met.
