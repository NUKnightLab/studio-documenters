COMMISSIONERS
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
HERBERT T. SCHUMANN, JR., County Commiss ioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
Amending the Resolution Regarding the Regulation of Signs
Approved and Adopted January 20, 1999
Whereas, the regul ation and zoning control of signs in the unincorporated areas of Cook County
were adopted 6¥ef almost twenty-five years ago; and
Whereas, numerous conflicts have developed over the years between the growth and development
of the unincorporated areas and areas under municipal authority, and the proliferation of signs,
particularly large advertising signs; and
Whereas, s igns permitted under the 1976 Cook County Zoning Ordinance are now considered out
of place, particularly in areas attempting to preserve scenic and aesthetic assets; and
Whereas, a comprehensive amendment to Article 12 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance has
been proposed and introduced for consideration by the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
Whereas, the proposed amendments have been referred to the Committee on Zoning for public
hearing and comment, which process +s was expected to take several months to complete; and
Whereas, these proposed sign regulations have yet to be considered by the Committee on Zoning
and Building; and
Whereas, the proposed sign regulations will substantially amend the s ize and location permitted
for many signs, and will make certain signs non-conforming subject to amortization and removal; and
Whereas, the ongoing isst:Janee of bHilding permits and/or zoning relief 1:Jnder the e>dsting zoning
ordinanee 1:Jndermines the ability of Cook County to effeetively regt:Jlate the proliferation of eontlieting
signs thro1:Jgho1:Jt the 1:Jnineorporated areas of Cook Cot:Jnty.
Whereas the moratorium on the iss uance of permits for advertising signs has been effective in
limiting the proliferation of adve1tising signs, however, bus inesses in unincorporated Cook County are
seeking zoning relief for the replacement and modernization of on premi ses advertising signs;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
From the date of adoption of this Resolution and until review of the comprehensive amendment
I.
to Article 12 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance has been completed, there shall be a moratorium on
the issuance of any and all permits for the construction, expansion or relocation of all signs or for zoning
relief as regulated by Article 12 of the 1976 Cook County Zoning Ordinance.

1765

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 15, 200 I
2.
The Commissioner of Building and Zoning shall, upon sufficient evidence submitted by an
app licant, have the authority to issue a permit fo r replacement of s ign(s)located on and within the
premises of a business or property owner where such sign(s)existed prior to the moratorium and which
have come into disrepair due to damage by weather conditions, accident, intentional acts of vandalism, eF
in instances where the business at which the existing sign is located has changed, or in instances in which
the property or business owner deems that an existing on premises sign no longer appropriately projects
the quality of the business and where, due to the age and deterioration of construction materials used,
such sign(s) detract from the value of the business property. The issuance of a permit fo r the replacement
of previously existing signs shall be only fo r restricted to applications for those on premises signs oot
reqlliring a Yariation f'rorn , and that meet the req uirements of, the 1976 Cook County Zoning Ordinance.
3.
The Commissioner of Bui lding and Zoning shall take appropriate steps to inform the Zoning
Administrator and the Zoning Board of Appeals of this relief under the moratorium.
4.
If, upon the expiration of six months from the date of adoption of this amended moratorium ,
review of the proposed amend ments to Article 12 has not been concluded, the this amended moratorium
hereby imposed shall be reviewed and the County Board shall determine whether a basis exists to extend
the moratorium for a further period of time.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Schumann, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Friday, May 4, 200 I at the hour of I 0:30 AM in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the followi ng items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to suspend the rules so that Item
236803 may be considered. The motion carried.
236803

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Comm unication dated June 9, 2000:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for Rockwell Warehouse Renovation: Phase II - Interior. It is
respectfully requested that thi s honorable body approve this request.
This project involves the upgrade/replacement of mechanical and e lectrical systems,
plumbing and sprinkler systems, and life safety systems.
Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient fu nds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 6/20/00.
*Deferred at the Construction Meeting of 6/28/00.
Chairman Carr asked Michael LaMont to give a brief explanation in regards to the supplemental item.
Michael LaMont stated that the s upplemental item is for the interior upgrade of the mechanical-e lectrical
system at the Rockwell Warehouse. In June 2000, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy asked for
approval to advertise for bids for the upgrade, but studies of the electrical system were being conducted at
the time the request came before the committee. Mr. LaMont said he then req uested that the item be
deferred in comm ittee until the studies were completed. He said the initial request was less of an upgrade,
but now a more extensive upgrade of the electrical and mechanical systems is being requested. He
commented that it was believed the switchgear and electrical distribution panels could be reused,
however, the decision was made to replace them.
Mr. LaMont informed the committee that the boiler system dates back to the I 920's and also needs to be
replaced. A new stand-alone boiler room wi ll be built, which will be more cost efficient. He stated that
when the Office of Capital Planning and Policy received the recommendations from the consultant, he
realized there was not enough appropriation in the bond account so the decision was made to wait until
the Capital Budget for fiscal year 200 I could be amended.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Vice Chairman Butler, moved to approve Communication No.
236803. The motion carried.
Commissioner Collins voted present on the above item.

Michael LaMont explained that there are two items re lated to building out the data center at the New
Cook County Hospital, the one that is before the committee today and a previous one that is
Communication number 243249. He explained that in building out the data center there are two
components, the data center itself which is a room of approximately 6,000 square feet in the hospital
building and consists of all the networking equipment, the floor and the environmental controls that are
being bid. He further stated that Communication number 243254 involves getti ng the proper power to the
data center room. The data center room has specialized power requirements that are over and above what
the hospital can handle. He also stated that when the architect began with the design of the hospital in
1996, there was no budget approved, plan or layout exactly for a data center because it was too early to
begin that type of planning, however, space was identified fo r the data center. Once the design proceeded
and the electrical loadings were defined, Unisource Network Systems looked at the amount of power
coming out of the new power plant and determined there was not sufficient power. He said he is
requesting authorization for Unisource Network Systems to bring the necessary normal and emergency
power from the new power plant into the data room .
Mr. LaMont said the reason the Office of Capital Planning and Policy is requesting a contract
modification is that the equipment needed to bring the power to the substations, switch gear and transfer
switches must be compatible with existing hospital equipment. He stated that if the County wou ld go to
bid, the cost would be more because the County may have to bring on new contractors who are unfamiliar
with the equipment, the plant and existing warranties may be voided.
