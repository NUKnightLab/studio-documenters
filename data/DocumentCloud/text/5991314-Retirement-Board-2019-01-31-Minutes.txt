Working with staff and have already begun the process of writing job descriptions for every staff
member. Complete with creating a legitimate organizational chart for the entire office hierarchy.
Working with Fund Counsel on an updated version of the employee policy.
Involvement with the pre-retirement seminar in January 2019, with another scheduled for February 2019.
Responses to many FOIAs, often times with the assistance of Fund Counsel Justin Kugler.
Year-end planning with the Comptroller with both the financial statements and the actuarial report.
Written all Committee Minutes as presented today.
The biggest task facing the Fund is the process of all the records retention. There are boxes upon boxes,
plus there are seven vaults full of records at the warehouse. It's going to be a process to go and try to
investigate and determine the next process. The State has given the Fund the authority destroy a good deal
of those older records. It will have to determine just what was approved and then, finally get rid of the
records, if they're not necessary for any purpose. Fund staff will be going to take a look at the Laborers
Annuity and Benefit Fund, their process of scanning and storing image documents, just to see what, if
anything, can be gleaned from their system, and if there are recommendations to improve the systems that
are kept
The year-end, the investment reconciliations, as of year-end 12/31/18, the Board, the Fund, has assets in
about 59 to 63 separate investment buckets. With all the transitions that went on last year and all the new
investments that are still being made, it's going to be a significant task to get all of those reconciled for the
year-end statements.
Working with NEPC and Trustee Beyna to rewrite the Fund’s investment policy.
