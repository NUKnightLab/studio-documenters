Board and Committee Reports
E. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, October 21, 2011 (continued)
Director Carvalho inquired further regarding the Contract Compliance status of request number 27; he noted
that, in the future, when items are being withdrawn as a result of pending Contract Compliance review, he
will be asking the using department at the time of withdrawal whether the delay will negatively impact the
System’s ability to perform. Director Greenspan added that the using department should provide information
relating to the timeframe that indicates when the delay will negatively impact the department; this information
should also be forwarded to Contract Compliance.
With regard to the withdrawal of request number 27, Dan Howard, Chief Information Officer, stated that the
delay will not affect the System negatively, at this point. Director Carvalho inquired whether the System
Board retains the authority to purchase, notwithstanding compliance with the County’s Code on Minority and
Women-Owned Business Enterprises. Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, responded that the State’s
Attorney has opined that the System Board retains that authority; however, she stated that she will revisit the
matter with the State’s Attorney’s Office to confirm.
John Cookinham, System Interim Chief Financial Officer, provided an update on the matter regarding the
State’s processing of the System’s Medicaid eligibility applications. He stated that there is essentially no new
change in the rate of processing; it doesn’t appear that there is a gain in the processing of the backlog of
applications. He stated that the System is slightly better than it has been on a year-to-date average. He noted
that the System will receive weekly reports on the rejected applications. Mr. Cookinham stated that he will
provide information to the Board regarding the current size of the backlog. Director Carvalho requested that
information be provided regarding the number of System patients who are determined to be ineligible for
Medicaid by the System and therefore do not have an eligibility application processed.

amendments to the System’s Procurement Policy to reflect these changes are presented to the Committee for
consideration. Most of the revisions to the County’s Procurement Code went into effect on October 7th.
Ms. Haynes highlighted several of the proposed revisions. She noted that additional revisions are
recommended at this time, including those relating to the contract management section toward the end of the
Policy; a change in the term “Procurement Director” to reflect the title that is in operational use, which is
System Director of Supply Chain Management, or System SCM Director; and to clarify that the System SCM
Director may serve as a signatory on transactions under $150,000.
Director Carvalho noted that there are currently provisions that require certain contracting information to be
posted on the internet. Additionally, he stated that other provisions require that a log be kept of any outside

reductions to the System’s appropriations will have on the System’s ability to provide services.

Report from Chairman of the Board
Chairman Batts provided an update on the following matters.
Two Upcoming System Board Public Hearings on Budget
Chairman Batts stated that two public hearings have been set by the System Board for November 2nd and
November 4th, for the purpose of conducting public hearings on the proposed Cook County Health and Hospitals
System Budget contained in the Cook County Executive Budget for FY2012.
Appointment of Director Butler to Human Resources Committee
Chairman Batts informed the Board that Director Butler has agreed to serve on the Human Resources Committee
temporarily, until a new Director is appointed to the Board.
Update on Cook County Health Foundation
Chairman Batts stated that he will be meeting with Directors Greenspan and Muñoz to work on the selection of the
two members appointed by the Board to the Foundation. He stated that there is a potential donor who may be
interested in donating $10 million to the clinics; once the two Board-appointed members are selected, the other
activities necessary to the setup of the Foundation will follow.
Update on Activities relating to 1115 Waiver
Randall Mark, System Director of Intergovernmental Affairs and Policy, provided an update on the activities
relating to the 1115 Waiver. He stated that conversations have been held with the Illinois Department of Health
and Family Services for more than a year; the basic concept is that the System is seeking a waiver of provisions
that would allow the System to do early enrollment of the new eligibles under Health Reform in 2014. One month
ago, the System submitted a revised concept paper, written specifically for a federal audience; the System has
asked the State to either set up a meeting between the State, System and CMS to discuss the waiver, or to give the
System permission to meet with CMS on its own.

Report from Chairman of the Board (continued)
A. Board Education - Presentation on Conflict of Interest Policy (Attachment #7)
Cathy Bodnar, System Chief Compliance Officer, provided a presentation on the Conflict of Interest Policy.
The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Muñoz inquired regarding the timelines for automation. Ms. Bodnar stated that this will be a webbased survey; she noted that she will provide further information at the next Audit and Compliance
Committee meeting in November.

VI.

Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #8)
Dr. Raju provided an update on the following subjects: FY2012 Budget; Board of Directors Vacancy; CareLink;
Physician Indemnification; Prenatal Services Clinic Move; Provident Hospital Accreditation; and new Supply
Chain Management Director. Additionally, Dr. Raju thanked Dr. Terry Mason for his service in the role of
Interim Chief Executive Officer.
For the record, Director Carvalho noted that there was a matter that he should have disclosed at the September
28th Special Board Meeting. He stated that when the Preliminary Budget was being put together, there was a
directive to preserve services; however, the Access to Care budget was mistakenly cut in half. When the time
came to vote on the Preliminary Budget, the funding had not yet been restored. To remedy the situation, Director
Carvalho made a motion to amend, to increase the funding for Access to Care to restore it to the previous year’s
level; this was approved by the Board at the September 28th Board Meeting.
Director Carvalho stated that, typically when Access to Care is discussed, he points out to the Board that he is one
of the County’s representatives on the Board of Access to Care. He stated that he should have made that
disclosure at that time on September 28th.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
The Board of Directors of CCHHS approved execution of contract H10-25-113 with PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP to
provide performance improvement implementation services. As per existing agreement with PwC, under scope of
services section (I-B), this contract allows for the provision of additional Statements of Work (SOW) to be added,
changed and/or modified given the nature of the healthcare environment.
NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This is a request to amend and increase the current contract with PwC to provide an additional Statement of Work to
allow for the implementation of the standardized charge capture, physician documentation and billing for services
performed by CCHHS.
Statement of Work: Revenue Cycle Optimization, Cerner I Siemens Re-Engineering Project (2011-A)
In collaboration with CCHHS IT, Revenue Cycle, Gerner and Siemens vendor resources, and McKesson, PwC will
provide oversight support, project management, and subject matter expertise for the work effort related to the
Revenue Cycle Optimization and Gerner I Siemens Re-Engineering project. The work effort spans across multiple
functional areas to include: patient access; charge capture for facility services performed; charge capture for
professional services performed; COM for facility services; clinical operations workflow; clinical informatics; and
billing. The professional services COM and related billing is excluded from this statement of work and included in a
separate vendor contract with McKesson. The initiative objectives are to fully utilize the existing Gerner EMR to
capture data related to the services performed during the patient visit and to interface with Siemens for the billing of
services as appropriate. The initial grouping of clinics/departments was selected by identifying those
clinics/departments with the most diverse needs and collectively representing a high portion of the outpatient
revenue. These areas represent over 60%, of the outpatient revenue 9/30/11 YTD net of Medicaid FMAP/IGT
payment, and over 50 locations (multiple locations associated with select clinics/departments). These locations will
serve as the foundation for system-wide implementation for the remaining clinics/departments. The effort will include
a "Train-the-Trainer" approach to enable to CCHHS to continue the implementation roll out to the remaining
clinics/department locations. A listing of the first eighteen (18) departments/clinics is as follows:

Dialysis
Oncology
Opthalmology
Physical Therapy
Nuclear Medicine

Periop (Same Day Surgery)
Radiology
Radiation Therapy

changed and/or modified given the nature of the healthcare environment.
NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This is a request to amend and increase the current contract with PwC to provide an additional Statement of Work to
allow for proactive vendor management support related to the physician billing vendor activities currently being
performed for CCHHS by McKesson. This vendor management support is for a twelve month period or upon receipt
of a thirty day notice, whichever occurs first. The thirty days notice will provide the time frame in which to transition
activities to the designated CCHHS resource(s) who will assume these activities for the Health System.
Statement of Work: Physician Billing Vendor Management (2011-B)
PwC will perform activities that are typically performed by the CCHHS Vendor Management Department. Currently
CCHHS does not have resource(s) with physician documentation, coding, charge capture and billing expertise with
the bandwidth to assume the role of managing one of the health systems vendors having a high annualized revenue
impact.
Activities include but are not limited to:
1.

Utilize workflow information obtained from physician interviews, analysis of data and scope of services provided
by the Physician Billing Vendor to provide operational support related to physician billing and education tasks.

2.

Provide current state CCHHS insight to the billing vendor, highlighting areas of opportunity and gaps related to
physician charge capture, documentation, clinic structure and reporting. PwC will work with CCHHS and
Physician Billing Vendor to support work plans focusing on accurate and compliant physician services billing to
build momentum that translates into financial or operational gains.

3.

Provide implementation status and proactively escalate issues and barriers that impede or slow the overall
implementation of professional services billing across the enterprise.

SCM Director’s intended award or recommendation is posted. The Bid protest must specify the
basis upon which the recommendation is erroneous, or the basis upon which the Bid procedure

Bids, will not be considered if the protesting Bidder failed to make such a request.

Page 40 of 80

 (j) Bid protest decision. When a Bid protest has been submitted, no further action shall be taken
on the Bid until the System SCM Director makes a decision regarding the Bid protest. The
System SCM Director shall issue a written decision on the Bid protest to the protesting Bidder
and to any other Bidder affected by such decision as soon as reasonably practicable. If the protest
is upheld based upon a lack of fairness in the Bid procedure, the System SCM Director shall reBid the procurement. If the System SCM Director determines that the recommended Bidder was
not Responsive and Responsible, that Bidder shall be disqualified and the System SCM Director
shall either re-Bid the Purchase or recommend the lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder.
(k) Final action. After disposition of any Bid Protests, if the Purchase requires System Board
approval, the System SCM Director’s recommendation of the lowest Responsible and
Responsive Bidder shall be forwarded to the System Board for approval of award and execution.

the Contract to the lowest Responsible and Responsive Bidder and shall thereafter arrange for

not readily adaptable to Bid. Examples include, but are not limited to: Purchases involving
services requiring a high degree of professional skill where the ability or fitness of the Person
plays an important part; Purchases where the requirements are not clearly known; Purchases

POLICY
Covered Persons shall not be involved in any situation or circumstance that would cause the Covered Person to
have a conflict of interest. This prohibition includes the Personal Relationships of the Covered Person.
No Covered Person shall accept any gift from any entity, or an employee, contractor or agent of an entity, with
which CCHHS or its operating units is doing business or with which CCHHS has done business within the past

appearance of a conflict of interest. Covered Persons must comply with the provisions of this policy.

2.
3.
4.

Conflicts of Interest in Day-to-Day Business Operations of CCHHS Affiliates
Conflicts of Interest in Patient Care
Conflicts of Interest in Research Activities
Conflicts of Interest in Educational Activities

All Covered Persons shall preserve and protect the interests and assets of CCHHS. The business and

preference based on personal considerations. Accordingly, each Covered Person must avoid situations, which
may give rise to a Conflict of Interest or the appearance of a Conflict of Interest.
CCHHS has adopted a Standard of Conduct (Code of Ethical Conduct) that supplements the Cook County
Ethics Ordinance. This defines CCHHS' standards for ethical behavior by CCHHS Personnel in carrying out
CCHHS operations. Among other things, the Code of Ethical Conduct is designed to protect the integrity of
clinical decision-making. Patient care decisions must be based on the health care needs of the patient,
independent of compensation, financial arrangement or favor that may benefit the health care provider or
CCHHS.
Research activities at CCHHS must be carried out with the utmost integrity. All research activities must be
approved in advance by the Institutional Review Board of the Cook County Health and Hospital System and by
CCHHS management.

Educational activities (including professional and public education) at CCHHS must be free from bias and carried
out in a manner that serves the educational component of CCHHS’ Mission and responsibilities as a public
health system, and not the personal interests of any Covered Person.
Duty to Disclose: Covered Persons have a duty to disclose the existence of a possible Conflict of Interest and all
material facts relating to the possible Conflict of Interest, as provided in this policy. No Covered Person who has
or may have a Conflict of Interest with respect to a transaction or decision shall participate in the transaction or
decision unless authorized to participate by Corporate Compliance.
PROCEDURE
A. The Conflict of Interest process for CCHHS, including Disclosure Statements and conflict resolution,
shall be coordinated by the System Corporate Compliance Office, in consultation with the Office of
General Counsel. Questions regarding the Conflict of Interest Policy should be directed to the Corporate
Compliance Office.

annual basis:

Required Reporter must accurately complete a Disclosure Statement and affirm that they: (i) have
received a copy of this Conflict of Interest Policy; (ii) have read and understand this Policy; and (iii) agree
to comply with this Policy. Covered Persons will submit the Disclosure of Interests Statement on a
timely basis to the CCHHS Corporate Compliance Office.
D. Duty to Update Disclosure Statement: It will be the continuing duty of each Covered Person who is sent
such a Disclosure Statement to advise the Chief Compliance Officer within 10 business days of the
occurrence of any event that would have been described in the COI Disclosure Statement had it
occurred or been known at the time the COI Disclosure Statement was originally completed.
E. Addressing a Potential Conflict of Interest:
1. If the Covered Person who may have a Conflict of Interest is a Board or Board Committee member
or a member of executive management, the Covered Person shall report the Conflict to the Chief
Compliance Officer. The Chief Compliance Officer, in consultation with the CCHHS Office of
General Counsel, will review the facts of the situation and make a recommendation to the Chief
Executive Officer (or his/her designee), or in the case of a Board member, the Chairman of the
Board (or his/her designee), as to whether a potential Conflict exists.
2. The CEO (or his/her designee), for those Covered Persons who are subject to his/her supervision,

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

4 of 5

00.02.00

shall decide whether the potential conflict of interest that has been disclosed amounts to an actual
conflict of interest. If it is determined that an actual conflict of interest exists then the following
procedures shall be taken:
a. The CEO (or his/her designee), shall direct that the Covered Person refrain from participating in
the transaction or decision.
b. The CEO (or his/her designee), may impose additional safeguards concerning the transaction or
decision in order to protect CCHHS’ interests. These may include, without limitation, (i) appointing a
disinterested person or committee to oversee or review the proposed transaction or arrangement, or
(ii) deciding not to pursue the transaction or arrangement.
3. In the case of a Board member, the Chairman of the Board shall allow the Board member to disclose
the facts surrounding the potential conflict of interest to the Board of Directors in executive session if
he/she so desires. Thereafter, the Board member with the potential conflict shall leave the room
while the Board of Directors decides whether an actual conflict of interest exists. If it is determined
that an actual conflict of interest exists then the following procedures shall be taken:
a. The Chairman of the Board shall direct that the Board member refrain from participating in the
transaction or decision.
b. The Chairman of the Board may impose additional safeguards concerning the transaction or
decision in order to protect CCHHS’ interests. These may include, without limitation, (i) appointing a
disinterested person or committee to oversee or review the proposed transaction or arrangement, or

 RAM RAJU, MD, MBA, FACHE, FACS 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM 
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
October 27, 2011 
 
THANK YOU 
 
I want to thank you for the opportunity you have given me to serve the more than 800,000 patients of 
the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS).  I have walked through several of our facilities 
and  had  the  occasion  to  meet  with  our  dedicated  doctors,  nurses,  medical,  clerical,  professional  and 
service staff  
My  vision  for  the  future  of  the  Cook  County  Health  &  Hospitals  System  is  to  continue  to  build  on  the 
great work that has already been done and to seek opportunities to enhance what we do. CCHHS can 
become  a  national  model  of  quality  medical  care  –  from  registration  to  discharge  and  every  aspect  in 
between – for all residents seeking care within our System. 
In these uncertain economic times, I want you to know that I will do my best to lead CCHHS by example. 
I will work hard and I’m asking all to join me in the effort to improve our efficiency and customer service, 
attract more patients, curb our wait times, and be responsive to the communities we serve. 
In the days to come, we will face difficult decisions and effective change will not occur overnight. I am 
eager  and  excited  about  working  with  you  and  I  embrace  this  opportunity  with  confidence  that 
together, we can rise above every challenge and that success is within reach. 
 
FY2012 BUDGET 
 
President  Preckwinkle  presented  the  FY2012  Budget  to  the  Cook  County  Board  of  Commissioners.    I 
spent two days with the President, Finance Committee Chairman Daley and the County Budget Director 
Andrea Gibson meeting with the various editorial boards.  Over the last few weeks the Health System 
has  worked  collaboratively  with  the  County  finance  team  to  identify  further  savings  and/or  additional 
revenue  in  light  of  the  critical  revenue  shortfall  the  County  has  projected  for  FY2012.    The  additional 
savings consist of expenditure reductions including increased efficiencies, and contract savings as well as 
additional  projected  revenue  increases.  Through  this  process  we  are  continuing  to  build  a  positive 
working relationship with President Preckwinkle and her staff.

 BOARD OF DIRECTORS VACANCY 
 
The Nominating Committee of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System met on Friday, October 21, 
2011 and selected three names to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Director Andrea Zopp.  The 
three  names  chosen  by  the  committee  were  Rev.  Calvin  S.  Morris,  PhD,  Ruth  M.  Rothstein  and  Mary 
Richardson‐Lowry  were  submitted  to  President  Preckwinkle  for  her  consideration.    The  President  will 
submit her choice to fill the vacancy to the County Board for approval.  The appointment will appear on 
a  County  Board  Agenda  and  referred  to  the  Legislation  and  Intergovernmental  Relations  Committee 
chaired by Commissioner Larry Suffredin for consideration.  The County Board then has 14 days (or the 
next regular meeting of the County Board) to approve or reject the appointment.   
 
CARELINK 
 
CareLink was previously piloted at the Oak Forest Campus and Provident Hospital with more than 8,000 
applications processed so far as part of the pilot program.  On October 24, 2011 Carelink was rolled out 
System‐wide.  On the first day 185 patients presented with completed documents, to date four hundred 
patients were seen.   After transitioning the entire System to CareLink, the last phase of the program – 
the collection of copayments and service fees – will be rolled out.   
 
PHYSCIAN INDEMNIFICATION 
 
On  Tuesday,  October  18,  2011  the  Cook  County  Board  of  Commissioners  approved  an  amendment  to 
the Ordinance establishing the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,  The Health System requested 
this amendment in conjunction with our provider billing initiative and in response to concerns raised by 
our practitioners.  Those concerns involved the Health System's contract with McKesson which provides 
that  McKesson  will  assist  the  Health  System  with  coding  and  in  the  preparation  and  submission  of 
provider  billing  to  Medicare,  Medicaid  and  private  third  party  payors.    Specifically,  the  amendment 
provides for indemnification of practitioners for liability arising out of the preparation or submission of a 
bill seeking payment for services provided by the practitioner for the Health System, to the extent such 
liability arises out of the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of a person or persons, other than the 
provider, acting on behalf of the Health System (such as McKesson).  
I would like to thank the clinical leadership, SEIU Doctors Council and Elizabeth Reidy for all their efforts 
to  resolve  the  concerns  raised  by  our  practitioners  so  that  the  Health  System  can  proceed  with  its 
initiative to bill for professional services. The physician billing effort is critical component of the financial 
stability of the Health System. This is a great example of how we can collaboratively work together to 

Page 78 of 80

 come to a resolution that allows us to move forward.  I would also like to thank Commissioners Butler 
and  Goslin  for  sponsoring  the  ordinance  amendment  and  President  Preckwinkle  and  the  Cook  County 
Board of Commissioners for their support.  
 
PRENATAL SERVICES CLINIC MOVE 
 
The Maternal Child Clinical Service Line Implementation Plan Team lead by Carol Schneider and Shirley 
Bomar‐Cole  continues  to  further  develop  that  service  line  consistent  with  the  Strategic  Plan:  Vision 
2015.  On September 26, 2011 the Prenatal Clinic moved from the fourth floor of the Fantus Clinic to the 
first floor of Stroger Hospital.  A few days ago I walked through the old clinic site at Fantus and the new 
clinic site at Stroger Hospital with the System Leadership Team to see the improved environment for our 
patients  and  our  employees.    There  will  be  a  grand  opening/ribbon  cutting  when  the  space  is  fully 
completed.  Valet Parking Services were instituted in June of 2011 for our maternal child patients.  Also 
in  May  of  2011  CCHHS  partnered  with  Circle  Family  Health  Center  to  provide  onsite  prenatal  services 
which resulted in the first baby board at Stroger Hospital born in September 2011 and more expected in 
November/December 2011.
