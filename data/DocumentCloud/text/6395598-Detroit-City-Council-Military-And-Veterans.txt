Winter in Detroit 2019?2020
City of Detroit Special Events Application

Our Ask
We are requesting to do Winter in Detroit for the 2019-2020 season. This will include a few
changes from previous years:
More markets in Cadillac Square
. No markets in Capitol Park
. Working with the Downtown Detroit Partnership and the Historic District Commission on
a new layout for Food and Beverage in Capitol Park that will work with new buildings and
retail opening
- Earlier timeline due to the Forbes 30 Under 30 event wanting to utilize the tent and
market structures in Cadillac Square. They will be submitting their own application for
the event in partnership with the Downtown Detroit Partnership.

Our Why?
To activate Detroit's downtown public spaces during a season that isn?t typical for large

activations and provide local Detroit entrepreneurs opportunities to expand their businesses
without a traditional brick and mortar space.

Food and Beverage Operators
. Cadillac Square: Elia Group
- Capitol Park: Eatori Market
Contracts will be finalized pending approval from the City of Detroit.
*Food and beverage operators are responsible for pulling their own MLCC license.

Trash and Sanitation BL Snow Removal

Bedrock will be handling trash and sanitation in the market space, while food and beverage
operators will be responsible for their own trash and sanitation. Bedrock and the Downtown
Detroit Partnership will determine responsibilities for snow removal.

Generators and Power

Generators will be used in Cadillac Square and Capitol Park. TBD on exact numbers but
estimated 2 in Cadillac Square and 1 in Capitol Park. There will be no on-site fuel storage of
Diesel fuel, with the exception of the fuel tanks attached to the portable generators. A fuel truck
will service the generators each morning before the market opens to the public. The generator
will supply power to the vendor marketplace locations. The generator will be place in a location
where it does not hinder traffic or cause safety issues. The generator will be secured with
barricade panels to halt public access. The power cables crossing any public traffic are covered
with cable ramps.

Securitv and Barricades

Rock Security is partnering with DDP to determine level of coverage. At least 2 dedicated
security guards in the market place in Cadillac Square. Food and beverage operators will be
responsible for their own security.

Structural Certification Letter
Junior-T Orangerie Greenhouse
Manufactured by Janssens AluSystems in Belgium

Hollingsworth Pack has performed a structural analysis of the Junior-T Model Orangerie Greenhouse
to determine compliance with the International Building Code, which has been adopted by State
and Local governments across all U.S. States and Territories. The Junior-T Model Orangerie is a
pre-fabricated aluminum greenhouse covered with 4mm thick tempered glass panels. A photograph
of the greenhouse can be fOUnd in the appendix of this letter.

Based upon our analysis, we have concluded that the greenhouse as currently Installed by Exaco
Trading Co. Is adequate to support the following loads per the 2015 International Building Code:

Wind Load: 120 MPH (3?second gusts)
Snow Load: 35 PSF (ground-snow load)
Roof Live Load: 20 PSF

Our structural analysis and conclusions assume that the greenhouse ls installed with a minimum
8"x16" tall concrete beam or solld-grouted masonry foundation continuous below the perimeter of
the greenhouse walls. The greenhouse should be anchored to the foundation with (8) mOUnting
brackets attached to the greenhouse frame, as specified in the Junior-T Mounting
Instructions" document to resist overturning and uplift wind forces.

If you have any questions regarding the matters addressed, or if additional Information is required,

please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate the opportunity to be of service.

Dear Ms. Fisher,

We are making plans for the 42nd running of the Detroit Free Pressfi~ CF Bank
Marathon, which we will hold on Sunday, October 20, 2019. We will offer a 26.2-mile
international marathon through the streets of Detroit and Windsor, a 13.1-mile
international half marathon, a U.S. only half marathon and a ?ve-person marathon relay.
On Saturday morning, October 19, we will once again feature a 3.1-mile 5K Run, a
Competitive 1-Mile Run and a 1-mile Kids Fun Run.

Last year, 25,411 participants registered to participate in these events. and over 20,300
?nished. We hope to sell out all events this year, with a cap of roughly 28,600 runners
walkers. Participants must pick up their race packets at a Health Fitness Expo
which we hold at Cobo Center, Hall A, two days prior to the event.

Our Sunday events route remains unchanged from last year, except for a short detour in
Corktown due to planned W. Fort St construction. We are proposing a new Saturday
events course, relocating from Atwater St (Milliken State Park) to Cadillac Square. See
attached "Event Changes Summary" for details of other event changes.

Attached are the City of Detroit Special Events Application and support documents. We
have also attached a draft of this year?s course maps. turn by turn instructions, Start-
Finish Area diagrams, street closure diagrams/requests.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need additional information. Thank you

Media Services Department Special Events

Detroit, MI 48226

Dear Ms. Fisher,

Please find below a synopsis of CONQUERED: The Of?cial Afterparty and CHARITY
VILLAGE, an event running concurrently with the Detroit Free Press I TCF Bank
Marathon on Sunday, October 20, 2019, between the hours of 8 am. and 2 pm.

Event location: For CONQUERED: Bedrock's Kahn Lot at the northwest comer of Fort
Street and 3'd St. and for CHARITY VILLAGE: Bedrock?s Albert parking lot, on the
northwest corner of Lafayette and 3rd St. Both are fenced lots, with an entrance
and exits as marked on the site diagram.

Whether participants run, walk or roll crossing the Finish Line and conquering the
Detroit Free Press TCF Bank Marathon is a true accomplishment that should be
celebrated. In its tenth year, CONQUERED: The Of?cial Afterparty CHARITY
VILLAGE will be the place where over 10,000 event finishers, families and volunteers
will converge and celebrate.

A local live band will provide the music and vendors will have food and beer available
for purchase. Admission is free and all are welcome.

We look forward to working with the proper city departments to ensure all areas of this
marathon event are covered correctly and that all of our participants and spectators
bene?t again this year from this celebration.

2019 Detroit Free Press/TCF Bank Marathon
Friday, October 18, 2019 through Sunday, October 20, 2019

2019 Event Changes Summary (as of July 17)

We have changed our name once again! Our new name is
?Detroit Free Press/T CF Bank Marathon? following Chemical Bank?s acquisition of
TCF Bank last Fall.

We are moving CONQUERED: The Official Afterparty from the lot on the northwest
corner of Lafayette and 3rd St (Albert Lot) to the lot on the northwest corner of
Fort 3rd St (Kahn Lot). Our Charity Village will move to the Albert Lot

We are extending the six-foot, chain link fencing for the entire length of the start
line, for improved participant and crowd control

We will not install the pedestrian bridges over Griswold Fort Streets as in the
previous two years due to cost and timing concerns

We are starting the Disabilities Division at 6:50 AM (from 6:58 AM previously) for
improved participants? safety

We are moving the Health Fitness Expo from Hall to Hall A at Cobo Center.
We are offering a new, more participant friendly floorplan

We are introducing a Friday night participant ?meet and greet? party at the Fort
Street Galley for a nominal charge and swag bag.

Our Sunday Events marathon course remains the same with one notable
exception. We will detour around an MDOT construction site on Fort St, east of
Rosa Parks Blvd. We will make a related distance adjustment between mile 11 
mile 12 in Corktown.

We did not retain our previous event management/equipment supplier. We have
hired Phil Talbert of Total Access Events, Inc to help us secure bids and manage
our equipment, structures and permits.

We did not retain our previous private security company. We have contracted with
ProStar Professional Service Group (formerly Tricon Security) to provide This
year?s security services.

We are studying a change to the course on the east side, using Larned St instead
of Lafayette St, between Rivard and Mt Elliott. This is a request of the City?s
Traffic Engineering department. We promise a decision in two weeks.

DATE: September 6, 2019
RE: Police Surveillance and Facial Recognition Technology

On July 3, 2019, Council Member McCalister requested a comparative study of facial
recognition technology and its use by the Detroit Police Department. This important and
extremely contentious issue has been publicly discussed and received signi?cant community and
media attention several times, both in meetings of the Police Commission and the Public Health
and Safety standing committee.

Even identifying an accurate and clear understanding of how facial recognition technology
actually works is much more dif?cult than might be expected. The technology has multiple
formats and is used for many other things besides law enforcement investigations. One scienti?c
source generically describes the basic functions as follows: ?Facial recognition is an advanced
technology that helps in discerning and identifying human faces from an image or video. A
system employed to perform facial recognition uses biometrics to map facial features from the
photo or video. It compares this information with a large database of recorded faces to ?nd a
correct match.? That source identi?es the following steps in using this technology:

1. Detection: When the facial recognition system is attached to a video surveillance system,
the recognition software scans the ?eld of view of the camera for what it detects as faces. Upon 
the detection of each face-like image on a head-shaped form, it sends the face to the system to 
process it further. The system then estimates the head?s position, orientation, and size. Generally, 11:.
a face needs to be turned at least 35 degrees toward the camera for the camera to detect it. 1:1.

2. Normalization: The image of the captured face is scaled and rotated so that it can be
registered and mapped into an appropriate pose and size. This is called normalization. After
normalization, the software reads the geometry of the face by determining key factors, include
the distance between the eyes, the thickness of the lips, the distance between the chin and the
forehead, and many others. Some advanced face recognition systems use hundreds of such
factors. The result of this processing leads to the generation of what is called a facial signature.

3. Representation: After forming the facial signature, the system converts it into a unique
code. This coding facilitates easier computational comparison of the newly acquired facial data
to stored databases of previously recorded facial data.

4. Matching: This is the ?nal stage in which newly acquired facial data is compared to the
stored data; if it matches with one of the images in the database, the software returns the details
of the matched face and notifies the end user.

There is a broad and deep controversy involving multiple privacy, criminal procedure,
constitutional, technological and civil rights issues presented by this technology, which has
included national and even international debates about the propriety and danger of using facial
recognition technology, as well as police surveillance practices more generally. The Law
Department?s participation in framing and analyzing the legal principles would be very desirable,
arguably even mandatory under the City Charter.

This preliminary report will begin by summarizing positions, both pro and con, regarding this
technology. Recent local legislative bans and an Ohio state attorney general policy report on
facial recognition technology are summarized and attached.l Key issues underlying the pro and
con positions will be briefly listed and stated. Finally, the public positions taken by the Detroit
Police Department and the Mayor regarding their current and anticipated use of facial
recognition technology will be stated and evaluated, with an to clarifying the issues for
future debates and policy development.

case for facial recognition technologt'

The Mayor and the Police Department stress the value of this technology as an investigative tool
to counter violent crime. They deny that the City is using the technology for real time
surveillance, or in connection with the Project Green Light security cameras. They cite actual
instances where surveillance cameras have been used to apprehend suspects, distinguish this
process from any use of facial recognition technology, and cite one successful use of facial
recognition technology to identify an alleged criminal.

In essence, they depict facial recognition technology as merely a more ef?cient means of
scanning a book of mug shots and identifying the similar appearing faces of potential
wrongdoers based on the available photographic evidence and the technology?s ability to rapidly
biometrically identify similar-appearing individuals from a database of photographs. Crucially,
they insist that merely linking a preexisting photo and an image from a crime scene generated by

 

?Facial Recognition Inquiries; A Special Report" by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost

the technology should not be enough to convict an individual, it is not analogous to a DNA
match.

The Mayor, in the attached detailed written policy message,2 stresses that there have been no
?negative incidents? in the two years that Detroit Police detectives have been using this
technology. The Mayor?s of?cial written statement ?trther claims that ?No one has proposed
expanding its use.? However, multiple recent written orders from the Chief of Police (attached
Manual Directives 307.6 from April 2019, and 307.5 from June 2019) indicate that the
possibilities of using this technology for surveillance and sharing data with other security entities
has been considered permissible to a signi?cant extent.

The Mayor asks persuasively: ?If your loved one was shot and there is a picture of the shooter,
wouldn?t you expect the police to use every tool they can to identify the offender?? The Mayor
now advocates a middle ground position, prohibiting use of facial recognition technology for
surveillance, and permitting it for legitimate investigation. A proposed new formal written
policy to that effect (attached, Manual Directive 307.5 from July 2019), together with a policy
committee report, has been provided to the Board of Police Commissioners requesting their
approval.

Critics? case against facial recognition technology

 

Community and civil libertarian opponents of facial recognition technology argue that it violates
human and constitutional rights of privacy and freedom of association. They point out that,
whether or not the City itself is presently using such technology for real time surveillance, there
are clear opportunities for quasi-private security agencies, of which there are several in greater
downtown Detroit, to engage in such abuses; and it certainly would not prevent police officials
using improved technical capacities from doing so in the future. In other jurisdictions to date,
the use of this technology has been expanding very rapidly, with little to no meaningful
regulation, so the possibility of current and future violations can hardly be ignored.

Federal law enforcement and immigration authorities are reportedly actively using this
technology, posing an imminent and very serious threat to human rights, particularly under the
current federal executive branch policies and administration. Of particular concern with this
technology, even if it were limited to ?merely? scanning mug shots more ef?ciently than human
eyes, are a number of studies apparently demonstrating that the technology is particularly
unreliable and inaccurate when applied to darker skin tones and perhaps other facial features of
People of Color (and possibly also of women compared to men). Again crucially, opponents
argue that the demonstrated unreliability of the technology, its inability to generate a conclusive
?match" like DNA testing, gives police the opportunity to technologically justify what may
amount to just another form of racial pro?ling; this concern has particular signi?cance in a City
with Detroit?s demographics.

Indeed, the creation of a technologically-derived group of suspects who never consented to their
images being subjected to a technological selection investigative process triggers the
constitutional privacy and criminal procedure protections of the Bill of Rights, endorses

inherently unreliable investigative measures that raise the already-high risks of discrimination
and false identi?cation in criminal investigations, and even potentially expands the powers of
police authorities to target vulnerable groups for intensi?ed technological scrutiny.

Local bans on facial recngnition tecllnologv

At least three cities, Oakland and San Francisco, California, and Somerville, Massachusetts, have
already passed ordinances limiting the use of such technology. Their ordinances are attached.
The Ohio Attorney General has also issued the attached written report prohibiting police in that
state from using the technology without the state attorney general?s approval.

The San Francisco ordinance is quite long and detailed. It seeks to regulate the use of
?surveillance technology? rather than facial recognition technology per se, and relies heavily on
transparency and formal reporting rather than a legislative ban. It states that ?The propensity for
facial recognition technology to endanger civil rights and civil liberties substantially outweighs
its purported bene?ts, and the technology will exacerbate racial injustice and threaten our ability
to live free of continuous government monitoring.? paragraph But it appears to seek to
strike a similar balance as the Mayor?s most recent policy statement between legitimate
investigative use of surveillance technologies generally, and their abusive use to target and
oppress.

The Oakland ordinance, like the San Francisco law, emphasizes the historical record of using
police surveillance to target vulnerable and disfavored groups. (P. l, WHEREAS clause)
Otherwise, it takes a similar approach to San Francisco?s, without expressly denouncing the
dangers of facial recognition technology ?substantially outweigh[ing]? its ?purported bene?ts?,
but arguably with some additional clarity and a clear ban on city of?cials using ?surveillance
technology?, as opposed to facial recognition technology, without express approval of the local
legislative body. There are many unresolved issues of applications of technology, standards for
oversight, and how facial recognition technology itself relates to surveillance more generally. In
judgment, neither Bay Area ordinance should be considered the last word on regulating
this technology.

The Somerville ordinance simply bans use of facial recognition technology, and is much shorter
than the Bay Area ordinances. Clearly one of the threshold determinations for City of?cials to
make is whether to follow the Somerville policy of outright ban on facial recognition technology,
or the Bay Area?s favored approach ofbroad regulation of surveillance more generally.

The Ohio Attorney General issued a special report on facial recognition. It is attached. It relies
on the state attorney general?s of?ce granting strictly controlled permission for law enforcement
agencies to access databases for facial recognition technological exploitation, limiting it to
legitimate criminal investigative purposes only.

Constitutional issues

 

The contentiousness of this debate arises out of at least three classic civil liberties issues: 1)
How should the 123th century provisions of the Bill of Rights be applied to technological

investigative tools that the founders couldn?t possibly have envisioned when they drafted our
fundamental human rights law?3; 2) The oft-demonstrated reality that eyewitness perpetrator
identi?cation evidence is among the most inherently unreliable evidence known to courts of
law4; and 3) The lack to date of effective regulation or limitation on potential abuses.

The Bill of Rights to the US Constitution, in addition to the First Amendment freedoms of
speech and association, arguably threatened by selective application of this technology to
disfavored groups, contains a basic set of criminal procedure provisions:

0 The Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures;

0 The Fifth Amendment requirement of Due Process and prohibition on self-incrimination;

0 The Sixth Amendment guarantee of speedy trial and rights to counsel and to call and
confront witnesses;

- The Seventh Amendment guarantee of jury trial;

0 The Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments; and

The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of Equal Protection and Due Process, applicable
against the states and their local municipalities.

In light of the above bedrock protections for human liberty embedded in our fundamental law, it
is hardly surprising that modern digital technologies seeking to enhance police abilities to
identify and prosecute suspects based on impenetrable algorithmic processes, without any
discernible regulatory oversight to date, raise the kinds of thorny issues discussed here. Rather,
it would be frightening if residents of the City of Detroit did not care about these weighty
concerns, particularly where the databases being searched include all State of Michigan

 

3 This factor alone explains why a complete study of this issue would take a long time (and would ideally
be entrusted to a civil liberties expert scholar - or a team of them). To properly analyze facial recognition
technology under the Bill of Rights would require detailed analysis and comparison of multiple prior US
Supreme Court cases involving technologies that arguably invade privacy but didn?t exist in the late 18?"
century when the Bill of Rights was adopted wiretaps, infrared scanners, satellites, drones, sonograms,
and other modern technologies used in ?searches and seizures? of potential evidence of crimes. To
summarize a vast and dif?cult analytical literature, there is no guarantee that technological advances
necessarily enhance protection for human and civil rights and liberties. Quite the contrary, the framers of
the Bill of Rights were revolutionaries. The suggestion that police of?cers? views of such issues in the
21SI century are aligned with their intent is not warranted (pun intended).

4 This thorny criminal law issue of eyewitness identi?cation highlights the ?aw in any analogy between
reliable scienti?c evidence like DNA testing and facial recognition technology, as a classic case of
comparing apples to oranges. The potential for suggesting to a victim and/or witness that a computerized
facial scan has fairly and reliably selected an individual as ?looking like? an alleged perpetrator should not
be discounted as a major threat of unjust criminal prosecution and conviction. The claim that such a
procedure is not as accurate or reliable as a DNA sample does not diminish the concern. On the contrary,
it presents the above-mentioned serious concerns of technological bias con?rmation, suggestion of a
particular result, and racial discrimination, and on the basis of technology that the police admit is
unreliable. The fact they are even making this argument that the technology is not like DNA evidence is
very troubling, and suggests that the police (understandably in light of the scope and complexity of the
relevant controversies) don?t fully understand the seriousness of the issues and the profound concerns.

5

identi?cation documents and driver licenses, subjecting virtually everyone in the state to
nonconsensual searches.

The Police Department?s argument that its facial recognition technology is a ?mere investigative
tool?, like the Mayor?s argument that the Police Department under his supervision will not be
abusing the technology, are ultimately unconvincing. In addition to documentary evidence that
wider applications of the technology have already been ordered by the Police Department
(Manual Directives 307.5 and 307.6), the potential for other public and private agencies to abuse
this complex and secretive technology, and its potential to generate false convictions, cannot be
discounted on these grounds. If these arguments are intended to support robust regulation of the
technology, and its limitation to non-discriminatory automated searching of mugshots, as
opposed to unfairly targeting the vulnerable and suggesting guilt based on inherently unreliable
evidence and procedures, then it merely leads to continued controversy over what regulation of
inherently unreliable tools is necessary and appropriate.

Moreover, the statement that in police of?cials? Opinion a conviction should not be based on
facial recognition technology identifying the defendant is not reassuring at all. That is a decision
for a prosecutor, a jury and a trial judge with appellate judicial review in a particular case, not a
basis for legislative policy making or police administration. In a hypothetical heinous criminal
case, where an African-American defendant stands before an all-white tribunal (as occurs
regularly in federal and suburban courts in and around Detroit), the claim that facial recognition
technological identi?cation would be insuf?cient to support a conviction flies in the face of
virtually everything we know about race in the US criminal justice system and application of the
Bill of Rights and other criminal procedures in racially charged contexts.

At a minimum, the administration?s defense of current practices is an argument for better
regulation, not against clear policy and regulation. Whether or not there should be such local
legislative intervention, and whether it should take the form of restrictions on surveillance and
oversight of investigation, as in Ohio and California, or an outright ban on facial recognition
technology, as in Somerville, Massachusetts, are the issues for City Council in Detroit. The need
for legislative oversight has been demonstrated. form should be the focus of the debate.

If Council has any other questions or concerns regarding this subject, LPD will be happy to
provide further research and analysis upon request.

MAYOR DUGGAN: I OPPOSE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION
TECHNOLOGY FOR SURVEILLANCE

JULY 18
OFFICE

Dear Residents of the City of Detroit:

There?s been a lot of discussion and confusion the last couple weeks on the issue of the Detroit
Police Department?s use of facial recognition technology. Our residents too often suffer the pain
and loss of violent crime. We expect the police to be vigorous in reducing that violence, but I
wanted you to hear directly from me how I believe we need to balance that with the privacy
rights of our community.

I strongly oppose the use of facial reeomition technology for surveillance.

The Detroit Police Department does not and will not use facial recognition technology to track or
follow people in the City of Detroit. Period. Detroiters should not ever have to worry that the
camera they see at a gas station or a street corner is trying to ?nd them or track them.

DPD is not permitted to use facial recognition software for surveillance and I will never support
them doing so. The technology is just not reliable in identifying people from moving images and
research has shown it is even less reliable in identifying peOple of color.

I have spoken to several members of the Detroit Police Commission and have encouraged them
to continue this practice by formally adopting a ?no surveillance? policy for facial recognition
technology and providing for serious discipline for any DPD employee who violates this policy.

There have been a number of misleading reports that have confused Green Light or traffic
cameras with facial recognition technology. They are not correct.

The Green Light cameras do not have any facial recognition technology they are standard
security cameras.

The traf?c cameras we are proposing to purchase do not have any facial recognition technology
they are standard traffic cameras.

I fully support the use of cameras to address the violence in this community. I do not support the
use of those cameras to conduct facial recognition surveillance.

Green Light cameras have been enormously successful without facial rceognitirm
Nearly 600 businesses have voluntarily installed Green Light cameras in the last three years.

Carj ackings in Detroit have dropped dramatically since Green Light started in 2016:
Totat Carjackings Committed in Detroit

January?June 2015 222
January June 2019 94 687;

A 58% reduction in the number of carj acking victims is real progress. Detroiters constantly
heard warnings not to stop for gas in the city at night. Today, you can see large numbers of
customers at Green Light gas stations late every evening. They aren?t perfect, but Green Light
cameras have created zones of safety as prospective carj ackers have learned that they are almost
certain to be arrested and convicted when their crime is recorded on a high de?nition camera.

We Expect Traf?c Cameras to be Successful in Reducing Drive-bv Shootings without Facial
Recognition

We have proposed cameras at major intersections to ?ll in the holes of the Green Light system to
help identify vehicles used in shootings. This has nothing to do with facial recognition that
technology would be useless in identifying people in moving vehicles.

In January, a 3 year old boy was shot and killed on the South?eld Freeway on his way to Sesame
Street Live. It was a case of random road rage normally very dif?cult for police to solve. But in
this case, a gas station camera happened to catch a video of the silver Mercedes involved in the
shooting as it exited the freeway and it was that video that led to the arrest of the shooter.

We continue to have far too many victims of drive?by shootings and far too many remain
unsolved when police cannot conclusively identify the car. In the ?rst week of July, we had 12
drive by shootings with 16 victims. 4 of them died. In each case we had a general description of
the car from witnesses. For example:

Thursday, July 4th 9:55 PM: 61 Year Old Woman was shot on Orleans near Seven Mile by a
shooter in a blue Chevy Malibu.

Friday, July 5th 1:46 AM: 25 Year Old Man was shot at Seven Mile and Conant by a shooter
in a Burgundy Chevy Trailblazer

As of this morning, the police have not made arrests in either case. Had we had traf?c cameras
at major intersections, it is highly likely we would have license plate numbers and identifying
characteristics of the Blue Malibu and Burgundy Trailblazer.

The gun violence in this city is completely unacceptable. Cameras at traf?c intersections will
help identify the vehicles of drive?by shooters and ultimately reduce the shootings. We do not
need and will not use facial recognition surveillance on the traf?c cameras to accomplish this.

The apprOpriate use of Facial Recognition Teelinologv: learning the identitv of dangerous
offenders

The Detroit Police Department?s purchase of facial recognition software was approved by
Detroit City Council by a 6?0 vote in 2017. It has been used for the last two years by DPD
detectives to identify dangerous offenders, without any negative incidents. No one has proposed
expanding its use. Here?s how it is used today:

Oftentimes police get a picture of an offender while committing a crime. It could come from a
citizen?s doorbell camera. a Green Light camera. or a private security camera. Often we ask for

 

the public's help to the oil'enrier, showing their picture on the news.

Homicide detectives at times tried to identify an offender from a picture by spending hours
looking through mug books. In the last two years, DPD has taken the picture of that unknown
offender and used the facial recognition technology to try to ?nd matching pictures in mug books
and other records. 

On November 25, at 5:49 AM at a (non?Green Light) gas station on Van Dyke, a 34 year old
man was shot. The gas station?s security camera got a clear picture of the shooter, but no one
was able to identify him. A week later, the facial recognition software found a tentative match in
a police mug book. Detectives pursued that lead and quickly found that the same SLISpect had
posted a picture of himself on a public social media page wearing the identical distinctive jacket
he had worn during the shooting. Subsequent police investigation positively con?rmed his
identity.

If your loved one was shot and there is a picture? of the shooter, wouldn?t you expect the police to
use every tool they can to identify that offender? Police never make an arrest just because there
is a facial recognition match. But it is an important source of leads detectives can use to ?nd the
identity of the offender. I fully support the technology?s use for that limited purpose.

Summary

The Detroit Police Department has not and will not use facial recognition technology for
surveillance. No one is watching you on any camera in this city with facial recognition
software. I will not support the software ever being used in that way.

If you have committed a dangerous crime and the police have a picture of you, only then can
police detectives use facial recognition software on that picture to try to determine your identity.

The most painful moments I experience as Mayor are conversations with the families of victims
who just want to know when the police are going to make an arrest in the shooting. Those
conversations are even more painful when the family knows the police have a picture of the
offender and still can?t make an ID. Facial recognition software can be very important in
bringng peace to those families.

I hope the Board of Police Commissioners will adopt a policy that recognizes where this
technology is helpful, but which also strictly prevents facial recognition surveillance and
provides strong punishment for any abuse of that policy. It?s my hope we can ?nd common
ground on this issue.

307.5 Facial Recognition

5. The Detroit Police Department and, if applicable, any authorized requesting or
participating agencies will not violate First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments and
will not perform or request facial recognition searches about individuals or
organizations based solely on the following:

a. Their religious, political, or social views or activities; 

b. Their participation in a particular noncriminal organization or lawful event; or

0. Their races, ethnicities, citizenship, places of origin, ages, disabilities, genders,
gender identities, sexual orientations, or other classi?cation protected by law.

6. However, the Detroit Police Department accords special consideration to the
collection of facial images relating to First Amendment-protected events,
activities, and af?liations. Because of the sanctity of the First Amendment, law
enforcement?s role at First Amendment-protected events is usually limited to
crowd control and public safety. If, however, during the planning assessment
and approval process for the particular event, before proceeding with the
collection, the DPD anticipates a need for the collection of facial images, the
member assigned to vetting the event shall submit an Inter-Of?ce Memorandum
through channels, to the Department?s Legal Advisor. The Inter-
Of?ce Memorandum shall include the legal or justi?ed basis for such
collection (including speci?cs regarding the criminal behavior that is
suspected); and how facial images may be collected, used, or retained, in
accordance with this policy, as appropriate. If facial images will be collected, the
plan will specify the type of information collection that is permissible, identify
who will collect facials images (uniform or plainclothes members), and de?ne
the permissible acts of collection. Thereafter, the Legal Advisor will make a
recommendation as to whether collection of facial images by law enforcement
of?cers at the event is permissible and will forward the recommendation to the
Chief of Police or their designee.

7. The use of mobile facial image capture devices relating to First Amendment-
protected events, activities, and affiliations shall only be authorized by the Chief
of Police, or designee, in advance of the event. Facial images from a First
Amendment-protected event will be used in exigent circumstances when the
public safety mission changes or when it is in support of an active or ongoing
criminal or homeland security investigation that occurs during or resulted from
a First Amendment-protected event. When the Chief of Police or their designee
authorizes such use, the Board of Police Commissioners will be noti?ed after
such use.

307.5 - 7 Use of Facial Recognition Technology

Memorandum on Policy Recommendations for Facial Recognition
307.5

introduction:

In 2017, the Detroit Police Department (hereinafter ?Department? or 
contracted for Facial Recognition with Data Works Plus Company. Subsequently,
Detroit City Council approved the contract, and the Department has Operated
with the technology system for almost two years.

On January 18, 2019, the Detroit Police Department transmitted its first version
of the proposed policy on Facial Recognition for the Board Of Police
Commissioners? (hereinafter ?Board?) consideration.

On June 27, 2019, the Department rescinded the first version Of the Facial
Recognition proposed policy for ?technical refinements? and indicated that it
would return a revised policy version for the Board?s consideration, specifically
eliminating the surveillance or live video streaming component of Facial
Recognition along with other areas.

On August 1, 2019, the Department transmitted the revised Facial Recognition
Policy. The Department also indicated their willingness to engage in a discussion
and refinement to the proposed Facial Recognition policy.

The Honorable Board of Police Commissioners requested the Policy Division to
conduct a review of the proposed policies (both versions) and identify policy
recommendations.

The Policy Division conducted a robust review and evaluation of professional
guidelines and recommendations for the Facial Recognition policy. The Policy
Division further attended the Department?s Real Time Crime Center 
Facial Recognition Tour, and spoke with Department Executives. Additionally,
the Division engaged in reviews and communications with various officials from
jurisdictions and agencies around the country on the subject matter. Lastly, we
attended the weekly Board of Police Commissioners meetings, noted the
Board?s, public?s concerns and feedback, as well as the Department?s comments.
All of the above activity helped develop the recommendations listed below. See
references below.

The following policy recommendations are submitted for the Board?s (committee
of the whole) consideration. The recommendations are divided into two
categories: 1. Broad Category and 2. Critical importance Category.

The policy recommendations encompass reviews of both proposed policies.
Please note that within this document, recommendations entitled reflect a
Board proposed recommendation. Recommendations entitled 
consist of a provision already contained in the Department?s proposed policy but
was either revised or reemphasized for the Board's attention.

that owns and operates existing surveillance technology equipment or services to
submit to the Board a proposed Surveillance Technology Policy Ordinance governing
the use of the surveillance technology; and requiring the Controller, as City Services
Auditor, to audit annually the use of surveillance technology equipment or services
and the conformity of such use with an approved Surveillance Technology Policy

Ordinance and provide an audit report to the Board of Supervisors.

Section 1. General Findings.
It is essential to have an informed public debate as early as possible about

decisions related to surveillance technology.

Supervisors Peskin; Yee, Walton
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS Page 1

NA



Whenever possible, decisions relating to surveillance technology should occur with
strong consideration given to the impact such technologies may have on civil rights and civil
liberties, including those rights guaranteed by the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments
to the United States Constitution as well as Sections 1, 2, and 13 of Article I of the California
Constitution.

While surveillance technology may threaten the privacy of all of us, surveillance
efforts have historically been used to intimidate and oppress certain communities and groups
more than others, including those that are defined by a common race, ethnicity, religion,
national origin, income level, sexual orientation, or political perspective.

The propensity for facial recognition technology to endanger civil rights and civil
liberties substantially outweighs its purported benefits, and the technology will exacerbate
racial injustice and threaten our ability to live free of continuous government monitoring.

Whenever possible, decisions regarding if and how surveillance technologies
should be funded, acquired, or used, and whether data from such technologies should be
shared, should be made only after meaningful public input has been solicited and given
significant weight.

Legally enforceable safeguards, including robust transparency, oversight, and
accountability measures, must be in place to protect civil rights and civil liberties before any
surveillance technology is deployed; and

If a surveillance technology is approved, data reporting measures must be adopted
that empower the Board of Supervisors and the public to verify that mandated civil rights and
civil liberties safeguards have been strictly adhered to.

ORDINANCE NO. C.M.S.

 

 

ORDINANCE ADDING CHAPTER 9.64 TO THE OAKLAND
MUNICIPAL CODE ESTABLISHING RULES FOR THE
ACQUISITION AND USE OF SURVEILLANCE
EQUIPMENT

WHEREAS, the City Council finds it is essential to have an informed
public debate as early as possible about decisions related to the City of
Oakland?s (?City") acquisition and use of surveillance technology; and

WHEREAS, the City Council finds that, while the use of surveillance
technology may threaten the privacy of all citizens, throughout history,
surveillance efforts have been used to intimidate and oppress certain
communities and groups more than others, including those that are defined by a
common race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, income level, sexual orientation,
or political perspective; and

WHEREAS, while acknowledging the significance of protecting the privacy
of citizens, the City Council finds that surveillance technology may also be a
valuable tool to bolster community safety and aid in the investigation and
prosecution of crimes; and

WHEREAS, the City Council finds that surveillance technology includes
not just technology capable of accessing non-public places or information (such
as wiretaps) but also may include technology which aggregates publicly available
information, because such information, in the aggregate or when pieced together
with other information, has the potential to reveal a wealth of detail about a
person?s familial, political, professional, religious, or sexual associations; and

WHEREAS, the City Council finds that no decisions relating to the City's
use of surveillance technology should occur without strong consideration being
given to the impact such technologies may have on civil rights and civil liberties,
including those rights guaranteed by the California and United States
Constitutions; and

WHEREAS, the City Council finds that any and all decisions regarding if
and how the City?s surveillance technologies should be funded, acquired, or used
should include meaningful public input and that public opinion should be given
significant weight in policy decisions; and

WHEREAS, the City Council finds that legally enforceable safeguards,
including robust transparency, oversight, and accountability measures, must be
in place to protect civil rights and civil liberties before any City surveillance
technology is deployed; and 

WHEREAS, the City Council finds that if a surveillance technology is
approved, data reporting measures must be adopted that empower the City
Council and public to verify that mandated civil rights and civil liberties
safeguards have been strictly adhered to.

NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF OAKLAND
DOES ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1. This Ordinance shall be known as the Surveillance and
Community Safety Ordinance.

PROTECTING THE NPROTECTED

 

Facial-Recognition
Inq i ries

A Special Report

Whether accessed by local, state or federal
law enforcement, Ohio's facial-recognition
database is used only for crime-fighting
and is protected by limited access, strict
rules and regular oversight.

 
   

. DAVE YOST



  

A Special Report

 

Executive Summary
In early July, The W?a ashington Post published a story headlined ICE find state driver?s license photos are a gold mine
for facial?recognition searches.?

The story asserted that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Immigration and Customs Enforcement ?have turned state
driver?s license databases into a facial-recognition gold mine, scanning through millions of Americans" photos without their
knowledge or consent. . 

It also asserted that federal agencies have ?turned state departments of motor vehicles databases into the bedrock of an
unprecedented surveillance infrastructure.?

Although Ohio was not named in the story, the next day The Columbus Dispatch published a story outlining Ohio?s facial?
recognition database and noting that it had been used by federal agencies.

Ohio?s facial-recognition database is just one of 22 applications and data sets that are part of an online search system called
the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway, or OHLEG. This is an electronic information network that allows law enforcement
agencies and related criminal justice agencies to share criminal justice data efficiently and securely. Its purpose is to help these
agencies investigate and prevent crime. It is operated by the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, a divisiOn of the Ohio Attorney
General?s Office.

Following these newspaper stories, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost directed his staff to review the state?s facial?recognition
system to detail how it is used, what safeguards prevent abuse and who has access to the technology. This report is the result
of that review.

Summary of the results of the Ohio Attorney General?s review

The key finding of the review is that federal agency searches of Ohio's facial?recognition database constitute just
3.8 percent of all facial-recognition searches conducted since 2017. All were conducted in accordance with strin-
gent OHLEG requirements and safeguards limiting searches to legitimate criminal justice purposes. There is no
evidence of federal misuse of the facial-recognition database, such as for mass surveillance, broad dragnets or
other illegitimate uses.

Other ?ndings of the review include:
Ohio?s facial?recognition technology is strictly controlled through OHLEG, which provides criminal justice agencies

access to a wide variety of databases containing information vital to the investigation of crime and missing persons. One
of those databases is the facial-recognition database.

OHLEG is used only for criminal justice purposes. Those with access include local and state law enforcement agencies,
federal law enforcement agencies, courts, and government agencies that include divisions with investigative powers, such
as an inspector general.

All users of the facial?recognition portion of OHLEG are Ohioabased or, in the case of federal agencies, have offices in
Ohio. There are no out-of-state users of the facial?recognition system.

Access to the facial?recognition database is more restricted than that for other OHLEG databases and is available only
to those who demonstrate a specific need.

Currently, there are 52,680 OHLEG user accounts. However, 15,382 of these accounts have a status of dime/ed because
they have not logged in for 120 days. To regain access, these users would have to complete a new application. An additional
11,740 users are nope/tried because they have not logged in for 90 days. To regain access, they would have to contact
OHLEG to reset their password. This leaves 25,558 active user accounts, 4,549 of which have facial?recognition access.

Every user of the facial?recognition system must have an approval from his or her agency head before being assigned
a unique log-on, and all searches must be conducted for a legitimate law enforcement purpose under strict guidelines.
Each search is recorded for review.

OHLEG use, including the facial?recognition database, is audited by Ohio Attorney General auditors and by
independent outside auditors to ensure that the system is not being abused.

The OHLEG facial? ?recognition database contains 24 million images. More than 21 million of these images were supplied

Facial-Recognition Inquiries:

2017-19*

Public concerns about federal criminal justice agencies? use of states?
driver?s license photographs for facial-recognition purposes prompted Ohio
Attorney General Dave Yost to order a review of Ohio?s facial-recognition
system. The review found that, in each of the past three years, the
overwhelming majority of searches (95.5% or greater) were conducted not
by federal criminal Justice agencies but by local and state criminal Justice
agencies, as permitted by state law. Here?s a year-by-year breakdown:

Facial Recognition Inquiries August 2019

 

   

What is facial-recognition technology?

Facial-recognition technology is software that digitally maps facial features from a photograph or video and uses that data to
recognize those same facial features in a different photo or video. With this technology, a photo of an unidenti?ed person can
be digitally compared with those in a database of identi?ed images to seek a match.

The accuracy of this technology is rapidly improving, and facial recognition is being applied in a variety of ways. Retailers can
use facial recognition to watch for known shoplifters. Similarly, schools could use facial recognition to spot expelled students
and other unwanted visitors trying to enter school property.

Apple?s latest iPhones use facial recognition to unlock the phones. Social media platforms such as Facebook use facial recogni-
tion to identify photos in which Facebook users appear and to help tag them. Airlines have started to use facial recognition to
help speed baggage handling, ?ight check-in and boarding. Such uses are likely to spread, such as for verifying the identity of
ATM users.

For law enforcement, facial recognition has a variety of applications. For example, if a video surveillance camera in a bank
captures an image of a bank robber, that image can be compared with those in a database of identi?ed images in the hope of
?nding a match that identi?es the perpetrator. The technology also can be used to spot missing persons, abducted children
and victims of human traf?cking, and to help with cases of identity theft.

Although the technology has many positive uses, it also provokes concerns about privacy and government surveillance. For
example, the People?s Republic of China is making growing use of facial recognition to monitor members of disfavored ethnic
groups and political opponents.

These concerns are legitimate, so it is vital that facial-recognition use by government be conducted only for legitimate purposes
and with stringent security to prevent abuse.

Ohio?s system comports with state and federal law and has stringent safeguards limiting access and use of all OHLEG data
sets, including the facial-recognition database.

OHIO LAW ENFORCEMENT GATEWAY (OHLEG)
Ohio Revised Code Section provides that the

superintendent of BCI may operate a center for electronic,
automated, or other data processing for the storage and retrieval
of information data and statistics pertaining to criminals and to
children under 18 years of age who are adjudicated delinquent
children for committing an act that would be a felony or an
offense of violence if committed by an adult, criminal activity,
crime prevention, law enforcement and criminal justice.

ORC Section goes on to provide that the superina
tendent may establish and operate a statewide communications
network to be known as the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway
(OHLEG). The purpose of this network is to gather and
disseminate information, data, and statistics for the use of law

 

enforcement agencies.

ORC Section 109.57 allows the attorney general to

adopt rules under Chapter 119 of the ORC establishing guidelines for the operation of and participation in OHLEG, includ-
ing criteria for granting and restricting access to information gathered and disseminated through OHLEG. These guidelines
have been adopted and are codi?ed in the OHLEG Rules and Regulations. The initial rules were adopted in April 2005, with
updates on data security and use policy injune 2014. The rules for facial recognition were adopted inJuly 2016.

The following rules and regulations apply to criminal justice agencies (CJA) that wish to access OHLEG.

1.0 User Agreement

Any CIA that requests access to OHLEG must sign the OHLEG Agency/ User Agreement. The signature of the agency chief
executive of?cer also is required. The agency acknowledges that it is responsible for enforcing and adhering to all OHLEG
Security Policies and agrees to accept responsibility for all users from that agency.

 

A Special Report

 

"Each individual user the Agency/- User Agreement. All users agree that access to OHLEG is limited to use
for criminal justice purposes only.
1.1 Access restrictions

OHLEG law enforcement users are given access to a wider range of OHLEG attributes than are non-law enforcement users,
such as court of?cials. The CEO of each agency is responsible for determining and enforcing access restrictions. Users are
permitted to access only those OHLEG attributes that are directly related to their job responsibilities.

Access to individual attributes shall be based on the agency to which the user is assigned at the time of the use. OHLEG users
who participate through multiple agencies shall log in to OHLEG using only the OHLEG Agency Identi?er number for the
agency for which they are working at the time of access. The CEO or designee determines the allowable attributes and should
review those determinations when job assignments or responsibilities change. Any law enforcement of?cer who is a member
of a task force may obtain a separate OHLEG account by contacting the Support Center.

The nexus between an account holder?s job assignment and OHLEG access is subject to review and validation during OHLEG
Quality Assurance visits. These reviews are performed by Quality Assurance personnel from BCI, who essentially work as
internal auditors. Users shall not attempt to access any data, documents, email correspondence or programs contained on
OHLEG information resources for which they do not have authorization.

1.2 Access Control Criteria

Agencies should consider job assignments or functions of the user seeking access; physical location; network addresses; time
of day and day of week/month restrictions when establishing rules for access to criminal justice information (CJI).

1.3 System Use Noti?cation

OHLEG will display an approved system use noti?cation message before granting access providing at a minimum the following
information:

The user is accessing a restricted information system.
Unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and a violation of criminal law.
System usage is subject to monitoring, recording and auditing.

Use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording the system includes all data, software, media and
hardware.

The law enforcement data maintained by BCI on the OHLEG site is provided at and subject to the discretion of BCI 
BCl?s grant of access to confers upon the user no process or other rights in maintaining access.

The user must acknowledge the noti?cation message before the user can gain access.

1.4 Personnel Security

Having proper security measures against inside threats is a critical component of the OHLEG security policies. This section?s
security terms and requirements apply to all personnel who have access to OHLEG, including those individuals with only physical
or local access to devices that store, process or transmit le. Access to OHLEG is a privilege and not a right.

The minimum screening requirements for individuals requiring access to CJI are as follows:

1. To verify identi?cation, state of residence and national ?ngerprint-based record checks shall be conducted within 30
days of assignment for all personnel who have direct access to or CH and those who have direct responsibility
to con?gure and maintain computer systems and networks with direct access to OHLEG.



. The agency CEO shall specify the agency process for requesting access.

3. If a felony conviction of any kind exists, the agency CEO shall deny access to OHLEG. Howeverreview by the OI-ILEG director in extenuating circumstances in which the severity of the offense and the length of
time that has passed might support a variance.

4. If the person has a non?felony conviction or any arrest history without conviction, access to OH shall not be granted
until the agency CEO reviews the matter to determine whether access is appropriate.

5. If the person has an arrest history that includes any theft, domestic violenee, menacing or stalking offense; telecommunica?

   

- - :se torma on,

the CEO shall deny accessreview by the OHLEG director as indicated in #3 above.

Facial Recognition Inqulries August 2019

 

If the person appears to be a fugitive, the person will be denied access to OHLEG.

. If the person already has access to CJI and is subsequently arrested and/or convicted of a crime, access to OHLEG

shall be terminated. If the crime is a non?felony, OHLEG access may be reinstated following a review by the agency
CEO consistent with #4 and #5 above.

. If the agency CEO, OAC or OHLEG director determines that access to OHLEG by an applicant/ user would not be

in the public interest, access shall be denied/ removed. If access is denied/ removed under this section, the agency shall
notify the Support Center in writing.

. determination as to an OHLEG user?s status is independent of, and unrelated to, his/ her employment

situation with his or her own agency. BCI will not make any determination about an OHLEG user?s job status, a matter
over which BCI exercises no authority or discretion.

1.5 OHLEG Access Procedure

No OHLEG user shall attempt to gain access to OHLEG or any OHLEG attribute beyond the speci?c access limits estab-
lished and authorized by his or her employing agency.

Requests for OHLEG access will be made via the OHLEG Online Account Application attribute, which is available on
the homepage of any current OHLEG user.

On each new user application, the Approver is required to certify that the basic training security video has been viewed
by the applicant and that the OHLEG Agency/ User Agreement has been signed by the user.

The new applicant must physically enter his or her personal information in the appropriate sections on the online ap?
plication.

The Approver will select from a checklist the OHLEG attributes approved for each applicant.

The Approver shall submit applications electronically to OHLEG administration for further processing and activation.

The facial?recognition attribute will require speci?c authorization by the CEO of the agency and justi?cation for each
user indicating the investigative or other area of responsibility requiring such access.

Non-law enforcement agencies generally will not have access to the facial-recognition attribute. Any non-law enforce-
ment agency believing it has an exceptional need for access to the facial?recognition attribute may apply to the superin-
tendent of BCI for facial-recognition access.

NOTE No non?law enforcement agencies currently have, or have had, access to the facial?recognition attribute. A federal

agency (which generally refers to law enforcement or criminal justice agencies) may be granted access if it has a presence in
Ohio for example, the FBI has of?ces in Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati and Dayton. On the state level, the has
investigators who are considered criminal justice agents.

At one time prior to the administration of Attorney General Yost, out-of~state agents and agencies had access to the facial
recognition database. An Aug. 14, 2014, article in The Cincinnati Enquirer indicates that about 150 users lost access after
then?Attorney General Mike DeVVine cut off access for out?of?state agencies No out?of?state agencies currently have access.

Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security

Law Enforcement Automated Data System (LEADS),

National Data Exchange (NDEX)

National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)

National Crime Information Center

  

The facial?recognition database is included in the regularly scheduled audits.

Five cases of OHLEG misuse have been documented 1n the past two years, but none involved the facial? recognition database.
These cases a1e pending.

Currently, there are 52,680 user accounts However, 15 ,382 of these accounts have a status of dz?im?a/m? because the
users have not logged in for 120 days To regain access, these users would have to complete a new application An additional
11,740 users are rmpended because they have not logged in for 9( days. To regain access, they would have to contact OHLEG
to reset their password This leaves 25,558 active user accounts, 4,549 of which have facial~recognition access.

Process for law enforcement to access the facial-recognition system

   

Users of the facial?recognition database are subject to
stringent access procedures and auditing practices.

To obtain access to the facial?recognition database:

DAVE YasT

An agency must be con?rmed to be eligible. -- 

The agency must be law enforcement (exceptions are
permissible, but none has been made).

 

The user must submit a new application, Facial RECOQHWOP- Criteria
and the application must be approved by the chief or 
sheriff of the agency (in limited cases, for very large
agencies, there may be an additional facial?recogni?
tion approver designated by the chief or sheriff). Af?
ter the information submitted by the chief or sheriff
and the information on the new OI-ILEG applica?
tion have been con?rmed, the user can be activated
for facial?recognition access. I .

Once the user is authorized to use the facial-recognition 
attribute, the mechanics for use are as follows:

The user signs on to OHLEG using his/her per?
sonal sign?on information.

A page appears with the attributes the user has permission to access.

The user accesses the Search Engine attribute. Once on that page, if the user does not have permission to access facial
recognition, it will not be an option on that site.

\Vhen the user accesses the facial? ?recognition attribute, a consent/waiver appears and the user must agree to te1ms of
use before being able to upload the search photo and launch the application. The consent form reinforces that faciala

The law enforcement of?cer uploads the search photo and launches the facial-recognition program.

The application returns photos, and identi?ers, of persons matching certain algorithms within the facial-recogrution
system. The run returns anywhere from zero photos up to 20 photos, depending on the match. As with ?ngerprints, the
better the sample, the greater the likelihood of a useful result.

All facial?recognition search photos submitted by the user and the photos in user?saved search results are stored in the OH-
FacialRecognitionlmage table with no retention limits. All image keys of facial?recognition search results are stored
in the SearchResultFacialRecognition table whether or not the user saves the search results. This allows the user to View recent
facial-recognition search results from the Recent Searches menu, even though they may not have saved those results. This also
allows the Quality Assurance Audit Team to audit all facial-recognition searches.

Photos in the facial-recognition database

 

The facial-recognition database consists of photos from a variety of sources.

These photos were sent to a vendor and uploaded into the database. There are currently more than 24 million images in the
facial-recognition database (24,380,731 as ofj'uly 2019). The sources of those photos include:

21,240,729: Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles

2,404,041: Ohio Supreme Court/Ohio Courts Network

A Special Report

 

Bureau of Motor Vehicle photos

In August 2012, then~BCI Superintendent Thomas Stickrath and Director Thomas Charles, Ohio Department of Public
Safety, Bureau of Motor Vehicles entered into a memorandum of understanding under which the BIVIV would provide in-
formation to the AGO and BCI and the could avail itself of the facial?recognition system and/ or receive facial?
recognition analytical information from the AGO. The BJMV agreed to provide Ohio vehicle registration and driving record
information, digitized photographic records of Ohio IDs and other Ohio operator?s license information, including demo?
graphic informatiOn, license number and license status:

The BMV also agreed to transfer to the AGO $208,500 toward the development of the facial-recognition system. The
AGO agreed to provide the BMV full use of the facial-recognition system except where use is limited by federal or
state law.

The MOU was extended through the years with the most recent extension, Tenth Amendment To and Renewal of the MOU,
executed in December 2018 and effective Jan. 1, 2019, through December 2019.

Initially, BIVIV investigators were using facial recognition to determine if those applying for or renewing an Ohio driver?s license
were who they said they were. The investigators were able to identify 26 people submitting false identi?cations between the
short time that the facial?recognition program was launched and the temporary suspension of the program by then?Attorney
General lVIike DeW?ine for a system review.

Between August and December of 2012, the BMV provided all driver?s license ID photos from 2011 and earlier to OHLEG
for the facial?recognition database. The BIVIV has provided no further photos to OI-ILEG, so all facial?recognition runs are
utilizing photos from 2011 and earlier.

State, federal laws governing the use of photos from the Ohio BMV

 

Ohio Revised Code Section 109.57 sets forth the duties of the superintendent of Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Of note
are duties listed in mandating that the superintendent assist sheriffs, chiefs of police and other law enforcement of?cers
in establishing a complete system of criminal identi?cation and in obtaining ?ngerprints and other means of identi?cation of
all persons arrested on a felony charge (and other crimes).

Section authorizes the superintendent to operate a center for electronic, automated or other data for the processing
for the storage and retrieval of information, data and statistics pertaining to criminals and delinquents. The superintendent
may also establish and operate a statewide communications network (the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway) to gather and dis-
seminate information, data and statistics for the use of law enforcement agencies and for other uses speci?ed in this division.
Section allows the superintendent or his designee to provide and exchange the information, data and statistics pursuant
to the national crime prevention and privacy compact.

ORC allows the Ohio attorney general to adopt rules pursuant to Chapter 119 establishing guides for the opera?
tion of and participation in OI-ILEG.

Pursuant to data and statistics gathered or disseminated through OHLEG and other information that is set
forth in sections (F) and (G) are not public records.

Although ORC prohibits the knowing disclosure, or making available, to any person or entity any personal infor?
mation about an individual that the Ohio BIVIV obtains in connection with a motor vehicle record, Section (2)
allows for the bureau to disclose such information to a government agency, including a court or law enforcement agency, in
carrying out its functions or for the use of a private person or?entity acting on behalf of an agency of this state, another state,
the United States, or a political subdivision of Ohio or another state in carrying out its function.

Title 18 USC Section 2721 prohibits the release of certain personal information from state motor vehicle records except
when there is a permissible use. A permissible use is de?ned in Subsection and allows for the release in connection with
matters of motor vehicle or driver safety and theft. Subsection also allows release of the information for use by any
government agency, including any court or law enforcement agency in carrying out its function.

The proposed memorandum of understanding between BCI, FBI

   

In August 2017, the FBI and then-BCI Superintendent Thomas Stickrath contemplated entering into an MOU concerning the
use of Ohio?s facial-recognition database. This MOU was never executed. It is unclear why the MOU was not executed.

It is worth noting that the proposed MOU would not have given the FBI any elevated access to the database. Essentially, the
MOU was intended to ensure that handling of FBI facial-recognition searches was being conducted in compliance
with federal regulations governing the con?dentiality and use of criminal justice information. However, procedures
already are compliant with federal law, making the MOU unnecessary.

Agents from the FBI already were authorized to access the facial-recognition attribute if they were located in Ohio, were
authorized to access OHLEG, were approved by the highest ranking agent of their office to access the facial-recognition at?
tribute, approved for access to the facial?recognition attribute and had an active criminal case.

The intent of the proposed MOU was to add layers of protection for the individuals whose pictures were in the database
when the facial?recognition attribute was used. The FBI was physically examining the returned photos in an effort to identify
only likely candidates. Had BCI and the FBI executed the MOU, the step-by-step process for an FBI special agent to access
the database would have been as follows:

The special agent would send the search photo to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division, or CJIS, in Clarks-
burg, West Virginia.

After review by agents at CJIS, the photo would be sent to Criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU). CIU would up-
load the photo and run the facial-recognition program. Any results from the search would be sent to agents with the Crimi?
nal Justice Information Services Division, who would manually analyze, compare and evaluate the candidate photo gallery
against the search photo to determine the most likely candidate.

The FBI would use the most likely candidate photo in a search of the Next Generation Identi?cation Interstate Photo
System. The results of this search would be compared with and analyzed against the original search photos.

Once this analysis was completed, the most likely candidate photo would be provided to the requesting FBI personnel as an
investigative lead.

Images and information associated with any most likely candidate(s) would be stored in the FBI Case Management System for
record keeping, and the other photos and information not aSSOCiated with a most likely candidate would be destroyed.

AUGUST 22, 2019
10 reasons you should be worried about

facial recognition technology

by Birgit Schippers?, The Conversation

Facial recognition technology is spreading fast. Already widespread in China, software
that identifies people by comparing images of their faces against a database of records
is now being adopted across much of the rest of the world. It's common among police
forces but has also been used at airports, railway stations and shopping centers.

The rapid growth of this technology has triggered a much-needed

debate. Activists, politicians, academics and even police forces are expressing serious
concerns over the impact facial recognition could have on a political culture based on
rights and democracy.

Human rights concerns

As someone who researches the future of human rights, share these concerns. Here
are ten reasons why we should worry about the use of facial recognition technology in
public spaces.

(1) It puts us.on a path towards automated blanket surveillance

CCTV is already widespread around the world, but for governments to use footage
against you they have to find specific clips of you doing something they can claim as
evidence. Facial recognition technology brings monitoring to new levels. It enables the
automated and indiscriminate live surveillance of people as they go about their daily
business, giving authorities the chance to track your every move.

(2) It operates without a clear legal or regulatory framework

Most countries have no specific legislation that regulates the use of facial recognition
technology, although some lawmakers are trying to change this. This legal limbo opens
the door to abuse, such as obtaining our images without our knowledge or consent and
using them in ways we would not approve of.

(3) It violates the principles of necessity and proportionality

A commonly stated human rights principle, recognized by organizations from the UN to
the ?London Policing Ethics Panel, is that surveillance should be necessary and
proportionate. This means surveillance should be restricted to the pursuit of serious
crime instead of enabling the unjustified interference into our liberty and fundamental

rights. Facial recognition technology is at odds with these principles. It is a technology of
control that is of the state's mistrust of its citizens.

(4) It violates our right to privacy

The right to privacy matters, even in public spaces. It protects the expression of our
identity without uncalled-for intrusion from the state or from private companies. Facial
recognition technology's indiscriminate and large-scale recording, storing and analyzing
of our images undermines this right because it means we can no longer do anything in
public without the state knowing about it.

(5) It has a chilling effect on our democratic political culture

Blanket surveillance can deter individuals from attending public events. It can stifle
participation in political protests and campaigns for change. And it can discourage
nonconformist behavior. This chilling effect is a serious infringement on the right to
freedom of assembly, association, and expression.

(6) It denies citizens the opportunity for consent

There is a lack of detailed and specific information as to how facial recognition is
actually used. This means that we are not given the opportunity to consent to the
recording, analysing and storing of our images in databases. By denying us the
opportunity to consent, we are denied choice and control over the use of our own
Images.

(7) It is often inaccurate

Facial recognition technology promises accurate identification. But numerous
studies have highlighted how the algorithms trained on racially biased data sets
misidentify people of color, especially women of color. Such algorithmic bias is
particularly worrying if it results in unlawful arrests, or if it leads public agencies and
private companies to discriminate against women and people from minority ethnic
backgrounds.

(8) It can lead to automation bias

if the people using facial recognition software mistakenly believe that the technology is
infallible, it can lead to bad decisions. This "automation bias" must be avoided.
Machine-generated outcomes should not determine how state agencies or private
corporations treat individuals. Trained human operators must exercise meaningful
control and take decisions based in law.

 

 

(9) It implies there are secret government watchlists

The databases that contain ourfacial images should ring alarm bells. They imply that
private companies and law enforcement agencies are sharing our images to build
watchlists of potential suspects without our knowledge or consent. This is a serious
threat to our individual rights and civil liberties. The security of these databases, and
their vulnerability to the actions of hackers, is also cause for concern.

(10) It can be used to target already vulnerable groups

Facial recognition technology can be used for blanket surveillance. But it can also be
deployed selectively, for example to identify migrants and refugees. The sale of facial
recognition software to agencies such as the controversial US Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has been heavily criticized for its tactics in dealing
with migrants, should worry anyone who cares for human rights. And the use of
handheld mobile devices with a facial recognition app by police forcesraises the spectre
of enhanced racial pro?ling at the street level.

Debate sorely needed

With so many concerns about facial recognition technology, we desperately need a
more prominent conversation on its impact on our rights and civil liberties. Without
proper regulation of these systems, we risk creating dystopian police states in what
were once free, democratic countries.



27 AUGUST 2019
Halt the use of facial-recogi?tion technology until it is regulated

Until appropriate safeguards are in place, we need a moratorium on biometric
technology that identifies individuals, says Kate Crawford.

Kate Crawford

Earlier this month, Ohio became the latest of several state and local governments in the United States
to stop law?enforcement officers from using facial-recognition databases. The move followed reports
that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency had been scanning millions of photos in state
driver?s licence databases, data that could be used to target and deport undocumented immigrants.
Researchers at Georgetown University in Washington DC used public?record requests to reveal this
previously secret operation, which was running without the consent of individuals or authorization
from state or federal lawmakers.

It is not the only such project. Customs and Border Protection is using something similar at airports,
creating a record of every passenger?s departure. The technology giant Amazon is building
partnerships with more than 200 police departments to promote its Ring home?security cameras
across the United States. Amazon gets ongoing access to video footage; police get kickbacks on
technology products.

Facial?recognition technology is not ready for this kind of deployment, nor are governments ready to
keep it from causing harm. Stronger regulatory safeguards are urgently needed, and so is a wider
public debate about the impact it is already having. Comprehensive legislation must guarantee
restrictions on its use, as well as transparency, due process and other basic rights. Until those
safeguards are in place, we need a moratorium on the use of this technology in public spaces.

There is little evidence that biometric technology can identify suspects quickly or in real time. No
peer-reviewed studies have shown convincing data that the technology has sufficient accuracy to
meet the US constitutional standards of due process, probable cause and equal protection that are
required for searches and arrests.

Even the world?s largest corporate supplier of police body cameras Axon in Scottsdale, Arizona 
announced this year that it would not deploy facial-recognition technology in any of its products
because it was too unreliable for police work and ?could exacerbate existing inequities in policing, for
example by penalizing black or communities". Three cities in the United States have banned
the use of facial recognition by law?enforcement agencies, citing bias concerns.

They are right to be worried. These tools generate many of the same biases as human law?
enforcement officers, but with the false patina of technical neutrality. The researchers Joy Buolamwin
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and Timnit Gebru, then at Microsoft Research

in New York City, showed that some of the most advanced facial-recognition software failed to
accurately identify dark?skinned women 35% of the time, compared to a 1% error rate for white men.
Separate work showed that these technologies mismatched 28 US members of Congress to a database
of mugshots, with a nearly 40% error rate for members of colour. Researchers at the University of
Essex in Colchester, UK, tested a facial?recognition technology used by London?s Metropolitan Police,
and found it made just 8 correct matches out of a series of 42, an error rate they suspect would not be
found lawful in court. Subsequently, a parliamentary committee called for trials of facial-recognition
technology to be halted until a legal framework could be established.

But we should not imagine that the most we can hope for is technical parity for the surveillance
armoury. Much more than technical improvements are needed. These tools are dangerous when they
fail and harmful when they work. We need legal guard rails for all biometric surveillance systems,
particularly as they improve in accuracy and invasiveness. Accordingly, the AI Now Institute that I co?
founded at New York University has crafted four principles for a protective framework.

First, given the costly errors, discrimination and privacy invasions associated with facial?recognition
systems, policymakers should not fund or deploy them until they have been vetted and strong
protections have been put in place. That includes prohibiting links between private and government
databases.

Second, legislation should require that public agencies rigorously review biometric technologies for
bias, privacy and civil?rights concerns, as well as solicit public input before they are used. Agencies
that want to deploy these technologies should be required to carry out a formal algorithmic impact
assessment (AIA). Modelled after impact?assessment frameworks for human rights, environmental
protection and data protection, AIAs help governments to evaluate artificial?intelligence systems and
guarantee public input.

Third, governments should require corporations to waive any legal restrictions on researching or
overseeing these systems. As we outlined in the AI Now Report 2018, tech companies are currently
able to use trade?secrecy laws to shield themselves from public scrutiny. This creates a legal ?black
box' that is just as opaque as any algorithmic ?black box?, and serves to shut down investigations into
the social implications of these systems.

Finally, we need greater whistle-blower protections for technology?company employees to ensure
that the three other principles are working. Tech workers themselves have emerged as a powerful
force of accountability: for example, whistle?blowers revealed Google?s work on a censored search
engine in China. Without greater protections, they are in danger of retaliation.

Scholars have been pointing to the technical and social risks of facial recognition for years. Greater
accuracy is not the point. We need strong legal safeguards that guarantee civil rights, fairness and
accountability. Otherwise, this technology will make all of us less free.

Facial Recognition Technology: Here Are The Important Pros And Cons
Bernard Marr Contributor

When you post a photo on Facebook, and the platform automatically tags the people in the
image, you might not give much thought to the technology behind the convenience. However,
when you discover that facial recognition technology could track you without your permission
while you walk down a street in London, it might make you question the invasion of your
privacy. Just like with any other new technology, facial recognition brings positives and
negatives with it. Since it?s here to stay and expanding, it?s good to be aware of the pros and
cons of facial recognition.

What is facial recognition, and how does it work?

Facial recognition is a biometric technology that uses distinguishable facial features to identify a
person. Allied Market Research expects the facial recognition market to grow to $9.6 billion by
2022. Today, it?s used in a variety of ways from allowing you to unlock your phone, go through
security at the airport, purchase products at stores and in the case of entertainer and musician
Taylor Swift it was used to identify if her known stalkers came through the gate at her Rose
Bowl concert in May 2018.

Today, we are inundated with data of all kinds, but the plethora of photo and video data available
provides the dataset required to make facial recognition technology work. Facial recognition
systems analyze the visual data and millions of images and videos created by hi gh-quality
Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras installed in our cities for security, smartphones,
social media, and other online activity. Machine learning and arti?cial intelligence capabilities in
the software map distinguishable facial features mathematically, look for patterns in the visual
data, and compare new images and videos to other data stored in facial recognition databases to
determine identity.

Pros of facial recognition

One of the major advantages of facial recognition technology is safety and security. Law
enforcement agencies use the technology to uncover criminals or to ?nd missing children or
seniors. In New York, police were able to apprehend an accused rapist using facial recognition
technology within 24 hours of an incident where he threatened a woman with rape at knifepoint.
In cities where police don?t have time to help ?ght petty crime, business owners are installing
facial-recognition systems to watch people and identify subjects of interest when they come in
their stores.

Airports are increasingly adding facial recognition technology to security checkpoints; the US.
Department of Homeland Security predicts that it will be used on 97 percent of travelers by
2023. When people know they are being watched, they are less likely to commit crimes so the
possibility of facial recognition technology being used could deter crime.

Since there is no contact required for facial recognition like there is with ?ngerprinting or other
security measures, facial recognition offers a quick, automatic, and seamless veri?cation
experience. There is nothing such as a key or ID. that can be lost or stolen.

Facial recognition can add conveniences. In addition to helping you tag photos in Facebook or
your cloud storage via Apple and Google, you will start to be able to check-out at stores without
pulling out money or credit cards?your face will be scanned. At the AI. Bar, facial recognition
technology is used to add patrons who approach the bar to a running queue to get served their
drinks more ef?ciently.

Although possible, it?s hard to fool facial recognition technology so it can also help prevent
fraud.

Cons of facial recognition

The biggest drawback for facial recognition technology in most people's opinions is the threat to
an individual's privacy. In fact, several cities have considered or will ban real-time facial
recognition surveillance use by law enforcement, including San Francisco, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and more. These municipalities determined the risks of using the technology
outweighed the bene?ts. Police can still use footage from personally owned devices such as Nest
cameras to ?nd criminals; it's just not allowing the government entities to use live facial
recognition software.

While London?s King?s Cross is using facial recognition, London is also at the forefront of
democratic societies in its testing of the technology. In test events, the city hopes to determine
the accuracy of the systems while grappling with how to deal with individuals who cover up to
hide their identity from cameras and other issues. Additionally, democratic societies must de?ne
the legal basis to live facial?recognition of the general population, and when blanket use of the
technology is justi?ed.

The technology isn?t as effective at identifying people of color and women as it is white males.
One reason for this is the data set the algorithms are trained on is not as robust for people of
color and women. Until this is recti?ed, there are concerns about the rami?cations for
misidentifying people with the technology.

In addition, there are issues that need to be resolved that can throw off the technology when a
person changes appearance or the camera angle isn't quite right (although they are working on
being able to identify a person by only their earlobe). It's dramatically improving; according to
independent tests by the US. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facial
recognition systems got 20 times better at ?nding a match in a database over a period that
covered 2014 to 2018.

Another potential downside is the storage of sensitive personal data and the challenges that come
with it. Just last week, we have had the news that a database containing facial scans used by
banks, police forces, and defense ?rms where breached.

 

In order to bene?t from the positive aspects of facial recognition, our society is going to have to
work through some signi?cant challenges to our privacy and civil liberties. Will individuals
accept the invasion of their privacy as a proper cost to being more secure and for the
conveniences facial recognition provides?

DTE Energy Electric objects to the property change. CROWN ENTERPRISES, INC. continues
to work with DTE to make mutually satisfactory arrangements for removal of DTE facilities or
granting of a private easement.

Detroit Fire Department (DFD) reports involvement but no objection provided CROWN
ENTERPRISES, INC. maintains emergency vehicle access to all existing building structures and
hydrants.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the requested conversion to
easement vacations and outright vacation of alleys, provided certain conditions are met. The
speci?c DWSD conditions and provisions for granting of private easements are included in the
resolution. DWSD reports that for all of the subject alleys there are water mains in Marcus, Rugg,
and Richardson Streets and the existing sewers can be removed. For Canal Street and Freud
Avenue, no water mains or sewers exist.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies informed of this
petition have reported no objections to the vacations. CROWN ENTERPRISES, 
commitment to continue working with all involved public and private utilities to protect their
installations is incorporated in the attached resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution and further respectfully request that your
Honorable Body adopt the following resolution with a Waiver of Reconsideration.

RE: Giffels Webster - Request to outright vacate with easement alternative of Marcus Ave, Rugg St
and Richardson St.

Giffels Webster, 28 W. Adams, Suite 1200, Detroit, Michigan 48226 on behalf of Crown Enterprises; inc.
respectfully 

The requested right-of-way vacations with easement alternative is located within the block bounded by
Georgia St, MT Elliot Ave, Huber Ave. and Belt Line. Approximate limits of the vacation can be found in
Exhibit A Alternate Easement, enclosed herein.

Giffels Webster has been asked to facilitate the requested vacations. We will be working with the City of
Detroit's Department of Public Works Civil Engineering Division, and all stakeholders to achieve vacations
that are satisfactory to all interested parties.

The requested vacations with easement alternative will neither impede pedestrian and vehicular traffic, nor
will it interfere with the maintenance of the public rights-of-way, including utility company and Fire and Police
Department access.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Tricia DeMArco by phone, at
313.962.4442, or by email, at TDemarco?qi?elswebstencorn.
