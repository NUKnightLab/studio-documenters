MOU agreements with public sector partners for participation in the lab @ Cuyahoga county
In 2019 the Office of Innovation and Performance will launch a new program, The Lab @ Cuyahoga County
(The Lab), to connect local entrepreneurs and businesses with public sector partners to test new ideas,
products, or services in a real-world environment for 12 to 16 weeks. Transforming Cuyahoga County into

matter expertise, data, and customer feedback needed to make the jump from product ideation and
validation to product launch. The Lab will be offered to businesses and entrepreneurs located in the five
county region outlined by Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake,
Lorain, Medina), with Cuyahoga County as a preferred location.
To expand the reach and impact of The Lab, the Office of Innovation and Performance invited other public
sector agencies to participate. This item brings forth Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with the
following public sector partners for participation in The Lab's inaugural cohort for approval and County
signature:

agreement, how to terminate the MOU, and what partner organizations need to know regarding use of
products or services as part of The Lab. MOUs were developed in partnership with the Law Department

 Item No. 3
2019 OFFICE OF HOMELESS SERVICES, CITY OF CLEVELAND EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS AGREEMENT
Scope of Work Summary
Office of Homeless Services requesting approval of a Grant Award Agreement with the City of Cleveland
for a 2019 Emergency Solutions Grant Program (ESG) Award in the amount of $658,770.00. The Award
term is 11/01/2019 – 10/31/2020. The funding was awarded to the City of Cleveland through the FY2019
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Emergency Solutions Grant Entitlement
process. The County is accepting a sub-recipient agreement from the City for Rapid Re-Housing program
activities in the Continuum of Care.
The primary goals of the ESG Rapid Re-Housing Program are to:
a) Provide a short term rental assistance subsidy to households in shelter to facilitate
a rapid exit to permanent housing;
b) Support a “housing first” approach to providing assistance which means that
assistance is offered regardless of the housing barriers a household may have;
c) Coordinate with community service providers once the households are housed so
that housing stability can be supported through community-based resources;
d) Monitor household stability to assure that once housed, individuals and families do
not return to homelessness.
Project Status and Planning
The Agreement term will start on 11/01/2019. The Office of Homeless Services received the Agreement
10/08/19. RRH activities are currently being funded through other federal and state awards. These funds
will be leveraged with these other sources to maintain rents and to serve additional households.
All three (3) copies of the Agreement require a signature in ink. After the County accepts the Agreement,
all 3 copies are returned to the City for its signature. A fully signed copy is then returned to the Office of
Homeless Services.
Funding – 100% of the Award is through a FY2019, Federal Entitlement Grant to the City of Cleveland from
the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
