Public Notice is Hereby Given that the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of
Greater Chicago (the “District”) will hold a public hearing at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th day
of July 2014 in the Board Room in the Administrative Offices of the District, 100 East
Erie Street, Chicago, Illinois. The purpose of the hearing will be to receive public
comments on the Amendments to the Cook County Stormwater Management Plan to
be consistent with the Stormwater Management Act as amended by the Illinois General
Assembly on June 18, 2014. On June 18, 2014, Governor Pat Quinn signed HB 3912
into law, becoming Public Act 98-0652 (P.A. 98-0652), which amends the District’s
statutory authority to allow for acquisition of flood-prone properties and to plan,
implement, finance, and operate local stormwater management projects. Accordingly,
it is necessary to amend the Cook County Stormwater Management Plan (CCSMP) to
be consistent with P.A. 98-0652. Revisions to the CCSMP have been prepared and
provided to the public for its review. The amendments to the CCSMP include updated
minimum requirements for both regional and local projects, and clarification on the
types of projects that will be considered for implementation and assistance by the
District.
By order of Kathleen Therese Meany, the President of the Board of Commissioners of
the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago
Dated the 1st of July 2014
