RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF “WE DON’T SERVE TEENS,”
AN INITIATIVE BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
AND COOK COUNTY BUSINESSES TO ENLIST COOK COUNTY PARENTS
AND OTHER ADULTS IN COMBATING UNDERAGE DRINKING
WHEREAS, as the new school year starts, the Federal Trade Commission is launching its 2013 ―We
Don’t Serve Teens‖ consumer education campaign, to raise awareness among parents, educators and
other adults of the hazards of underage drinking; and
WHEREAS, despite steady progress in addressing underage drinking over the last two decades, 23
percent of high school seniors report binge drinking and illegal alcohol use by teens remains a significant
threat to the safety of young people in Cook County and our broader community; and
WHEREAS, middle school, high school and younger college students in Cook County are at significant
risk of serious illness, injury and death when they engage in illegal underage drinking; and
WHEREAS, a recent analysis by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicated that
more than 800 drivers under the age of 21 were killed in drunk driving crashes in the United States during
2011 and several thousand were seriously injured, some with permanent disabilities; and
WHEREAS, younger teens who experiment with alcohol are most likely to consume it in their homes or
the homes of friends and to obtain the alcohol from adult family members, placing those teens at a
substantially increased risk of lifetime substance abuse; and
WHEREAS, the Federal Trade Commission has developed We Don’t Serve Teens as a research-based
initiative to educate adults on the basic facts and remind them of the well-known risks of harm to the
underage drinkers themselves and to the general public; and
WHEREAS, We Don’t Serve Teens provides parents and other adults with the means to play an active
role in further reducing underage drinking through greater awareness of the manner in which teens obtain
alcohol and the manner in which most underage drinking occurs; and

underage drinking, the costs of violating the law and strategies to overcome peer pressure and other
negative influences; and
WHEREAS, We Don’t Serve Teens information is available at a web site established by the Federal
Trade Commission, www.dontserveteens.gov <http://www.dontserveteens.gov> and the information will
be publicized in a coordinated print media, television, radio and billboard campaign initiated and paid for
by Crown Imports during the month of September; and
WHEREAS, the Federal Trade Commission has enlisted support of Cook-County based Crown Imports
to underwrite an outdoor media campaign to promote the We Don’t Serve Teens initiative to Cook
County citizens at retail outlets and other locations.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Cook County Board of Commissioners commends the
Federal Trade Commission for its efforts to protect our teens and the general public and endorses the
basic message: Don’t serve alcohol to teens; it’s unsafe, illegal and irresponsible; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County Board of Commissioners calls upon all licensed
alcohol beverage retailers to actively participate in We Don’t Serve Teens outreach efforts to their
customers; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, Cook County Board of Commissioners commends Crown Imports,
Cook County beer distributors and Cook County alcohol beverage retailers for their ongoing support for
We Don’t Serve Teens; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County Board of Commissioners calls upon all parents, civic
leaders and other adults involved in the lives of teens to post the We Don’t Serve Teens logo on their
social network pages and to utilize the information available from this initiative to increase awareness of
the measures they can take to further reduce underage drinking in Cook County.

The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any
Summary: The ACT Court will divert certain eligible high-risk offenders with behavioral health needs
from prison and jail into community-based services. Eligible participants must be nonviolent offenders
who would otherwise be facing a prison sentence as a result of new arrests for certain felony possession
of controlled substance offenses or retail theft offenses. Offenders who volunteer for the program will be
required to complete 18 months of intensive court-supervised, community-based treatment and
community services. It is anticipated that more than 200 offenders will participate in the program in its
first year of operation. Program funds will be used for staff and fringe benefits, professional recovery
support services, travel, training, and reimbursement of Cook County’s indirect program costs. No cash
match is required.
The ACT Court would join the court’s current highly successful Adult Redeploy Illinois court now
operating in Municipal District One (Chicago). That court is also funded by ICJIA grants and provides
services to adult probationers with new noncompliant behaviors.

Classification 8 that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for a commercial facility;
and
WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an application from Brian
J. Kamstra and a Resolution from the Village of South Holland for an abandoned commercial facility
located at 548 East 162nd Street, South Holland, Cook County, Illinois, County Board District #4,
Property Index Number: 29-15-405-044-1010; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined abandoned property as buildings and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS; commercial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying industrial
real estate eligible for the Class 8 can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the
date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property
from the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 8 will be assessed at 10% of the
market value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and

COMMITTEE REPORTS continued
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances justify finding
that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances
justify finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 8 requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building was abandoned
for 16 months at the time of application, and that special circumstances are present; and
WHEREAS, the applicant estimates that the re-occupancy will create six (6) to ten (10) new full-time
jobs; retain 32 full-time jobs and 41 part-time jobs; and create seven (7) construction jobs. The subject
property’s location in Thornton Township helps qualify its eligibility for Class 8 as it is in one of the five
(5) pre-determined communities automatically eligible for Class 8; and
WHEREAS, the Village of South Holland states the Class 8 is necessary for development to occur on
this specific real estate. The municipal Resolution cites that special circumstances exist in that the
property has been vacant and unused for less than 24 months; there will be a purchase for value with
substantial rehabilitation and that revitalization will not take place without this incentive.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the property
located at 548 East 162nd Street, South Holland, Cook County, Illinois, is deemed abandoned with
special circumstances under the Class 8; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to forward a
certified copy of this Resolution to the Office of the Cook County Assessor.
Approved and adopted this 2nd day of October 2013.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On September 16, 2013, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds.
The balance in the account at that time was $4,937.00, and the balance 30 days prior to that was
$4,937.00
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
As of September 16, 2013, the account for the sources of transferred funds had the largest balance of
$1,807,484.00. No other accounts were considered.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
The Department planned to fund $600,000.00 for the Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) GPS project in
2013, but this project has been delayed and will likely be implemented in 2014 with the 2014 budget
appropriation.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

Summary: This is a new two-year implementation grant. The grant will enhance professional recovery
support services and specialty court operations for participants in the Circuit Court of Cook County’s
Adult Drug Court Treatment Program. The grant will also be used for travel and training. The services
will target male and female drug court participants charged with non-violent, drug related felony offenses,
who would otherwise be sentenced to prison. No cash match is required from Cook County; however, the
Circuit Court has pledgedsupport in the form of employee time contributions.
The Circuit Court has a countywide network of 19 specialty/treatment courts that includes Drug
Treatment Courts, Mental Health Treatment Courts, Veterans’ Treatment Courts, and a specialty court for
women charged with felony prostitution offenses. The Drug Court Treatment Program was established in
1998 to assist nonviolent substance abusing offenders in their recovery from drug and/or alcohol
addiction. The underlying goal of the program is to help offenders readjust to the community through
jail-based and other comprehensive substance abuse services, increased judicial contact, increased
supervision, and the continuation of post-release treatment and counseling.

Concurrences: The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal
impact on Cook County, if any.
Summary: The TAC Program, which began in 1997, is a prosecution-based program built on a
foundation of victim safety and offender accountability. The TAC Program is a partnership between the
State’s Attorney’s Office, the Social Service Department of the Office of the Chief Judge for the Circuit
Court of Cook County, Life Span Center for Legal Services and Advocacy (―Life Span‖) and the
Domestic Violence Court Advocacy Program of Hull House Association (―Hull House‖). This grant
provides funding for eight TAC Team members including one TAC assistant state’s attorney, one State’s
Attorney TAC investigator, one TAC victim specialist from our Victim Witness Assistance Program,
three court advocates from Hull House, one paralegal and one staff attorney from Life Span. Life Span
took over the court advocate component in April 2013 after Hull House closed. Hull House and Life
Span, our not-for-profit domestic violence partners on the TAC Program, are critical to the success of the
TAC Program and complete TAC’s approach of providing wraparound services to high-risk victims
of
domestic violence. The wraparound services provided through the TAC Program provide a better
opportunity for victims to break the cycle of violence while ensuring victim cooperation, victim safety
and offender accountability. This grant does not require a match contribution.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CREATING AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL TASK FORCE TO REDUCE CRIME
COMMITTED BY PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND/OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of government as defined in Article VII, Section
6(a) of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois, and as such may exercise any power and perform any
function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has primary responsibility for individuals with mental illness and drug
addiction and it has imposed upon Cook County tax payers to shoulder the entire financial burden; and
WHEREAS, the closing of Illinois mental health institutions and resources for treatment at the local
level, are the driving influences for the increase in the homeless population, the crime rate, and
overcrowding at Cook County Jail; and
WHEREAS, according to the latest law enforcement data approximately 65% of homicides are
committed by individuals with mental illness and/or drug addicted; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has experienced a drastic increase in gun crimes resulting in injury,and death
of innocent babies, youth, and bystanders, which has drawn attention throughout the country and abroad;
and
WHEREAS, the release of thousands of ex-offenders and returning veterans who have exhausted all
legal means to supply their basic needs, creates fertile ground for expanding violent subcultures; and
WHEREAS, gangs and other criminal elements have formed a culture of violence and retaliation which
has begun to dominate economically distressed communities with fear, human trafficking and economic
exploitation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners create an
intergovernmental task force to reduce crime committed by persons with mental illness and/or substance
abuse.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the task force is represented of federal, state, county, local
government and community stakeholders. The purpose of the task force is twofold; (1) to develop a
collaborative system of services to facilitate our crime reduction efforts and (2) to provide more humane
services for homeless individuals with mental illness, drug addicted, jobless veterans and ex-offenders
who have exhausted all legal means for supporting their critical human needs.
