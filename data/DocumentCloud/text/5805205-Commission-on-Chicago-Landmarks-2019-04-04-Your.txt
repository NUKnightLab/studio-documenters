YOUR HOUSE HAS A HISTORY
You own a lovely home that you're proud to call your own. But someone
owned it before you. Someone built it, cared for it, and made changes through
the years to it. And now you're interested in finding out the "who, when and
what" of your property.
Researching your house can be fun, fascinating and completely engrossing.
This pamphlet will help you begin, offering advice on how to identify basic
information about your house and your neighborhood. It is designed to take
you systematically through the process.
Using the sources discussed here, you can identify: the date your house
was built, if an architect is associated with its design, who had it built, and the
changes that have been made to it over the years. Be sure to read the appendix
as well, where detailed information on resources can be found.
However, beware! Research can become addictive. It can also be frustrating.
You may exhaust every source possible and still not find the answers to your
questions. But no matter how many questions remain unanswered, you will
have unearthed some interesting information, learned a little more about your
community, and become familiar with some important public institutions in
the city.
So, have fun, and good luck.

TIP:
Getting Started
To best organize your time while conducting this research, read through this pamphlet and
identify all the resources you want to consult while at a particular library or historical society.
We suggest that you first locate a copy of your building permit (see page 4). Once you have
located this, more information - on a wider variety of topics - can be found at the Chicago
Historical Society. But there are many other research resources available to you.

YOUR HOUSE HAS A HISTORY

 What you need to know to begin

Some common styles in
Chicago and their most
distinctive features

Before you launch your research, it would be good to have a general idea
of your house's style and the approximate date of its construction.

Front Gable or Worker's Cottage
(beginning 1870s) - narrow house,
steep roof, off-center front door

If your house is newly purchased, the real estate listing undoubtedly had
a date typed into the appropriate box. While you shouldn't assume that this
date is correct, it may help get you started.

Romanesque Revival (1880-1900)large arched openings, masonry
walls, towers with conical roofs,
asymmetrical façade

The architectural style of your house can also provide you with clues to its
approximate age so you know where to begin your research. There are many
books available to help you formulate an intelligent guess as to style and date.
Some good stylebooks are:

Italianate (1860-1900) - widely
overhanging eaves, decorative
brackets, tall, narrow arched
windows

A Field Guide to American Houses, Virginia and Lee McAlester (1984)

Queen Anne (1880s-1990) - steep
roof usually with a prominent
gable, porches, variety of building
materials

American Architecture Since 1780: A Guide to the Styles, Marcus Whiffen
(1974)

Prairie (early 1900s)- low pitched
hipped roof, wide overhanging
eaves, horizontal detailing

The American House, Mary Mix Foley (1980)

Bungalow (early 1900s)-low
pitched roof, wide eaves, brick
walls, and bay window with art
glass

A Field Guide to American Architecture, Carole Rifkind (1993)
Identifying American Architecture, John J.G. Blumenson (1977)
What Style is It? A Guide to American Architecture, John C. Poppliers,
S. Allen Chambers, Jr., and Nancy B. Schwartz (1983)

Worker’s Cottage

Queen Anne

American Four-Square (19001930)- cube shape, hipped roof,
broad front porch, little ornament
Colonial Revival (1880-1955)cube shape, gabled roof,
symmetrical, prominent front
door

American Four-Square

TIP:
Dating Architectural Styles
Most new styles in architecture were first seen on the East Coast. In A Field Guide to American Houses,
for instance, the Italianate Style is dated as early as 1850, although it didn't become popular in
Chicago until the 1870's.

COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS

 Commission on
Chicago Landmarks
33 N. LaSalle St., Suite 1600
(312) 744-3200
Each Tuesday has been set aside
as the Commission's open
research day. The commission's
reports on historic buildings and
neighborhoods are also available
here for a small fee.

Step One
Checking the Chicago Historic Resources Survey
The very first place to look for information on your house is in the Chicago
Historic Resources Survey. A copy of this book is in every branch of the Chicago
Public Library and can also be viewed at the Commission on Chicago Landmarks
office. An electronic version of the survey is available on the City of Chicago's
website at: http://www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/CHRS.html. If the survey
lists the date and architect for your building, you're in luck. That means a permit
was found by Commission researchers and additional information may be on
file in the Commission Offices.

TIP:
Before Moving On To Step Two
If your house is not listed in the survey, you'll need to locate the building permit yourself (Step Two).
While this can be quite simple, it can also be challenging. Persevere however, as the information
gained will be well worth the effort.

Chicago Historic
Resources Survey
In 1996, the Commission on
Chicago Landmarks, published
the Chicago Historic Resources
Survey, a listing of over 17,000
city structures that are of
national, state or local
architectural or historical
significance. Street addresses,
architects (if known), date(s) of
construction, building styles and
types, Permanent Real Estate
Index Numbers (or "PIN," the
identification numbers that
Cook County and the City of
Chicago use to keep track of land
parcels) and Form Numbers
(tracking for research
information in the Commission
offices) are all included and
indexed for easy identification.
The Historic Resources Survey
may be viewed in any of the
Chicago Public Library branches,
local historical societies or in
the Commission offices.

Step Two
Finding a copy of the building permit filed when your house was constructed
Looking up the permit granted when your house was built will provide you
with the date of application (usually within a few weeks of the beginning of
construction) and may offer information on the names of the owner, builder, and
architect, the building dimension, type of construction and legal description of the
property. Cost of construction may also be included, but may have been understated
to keep the cost of the permit down.
Copies of historic building permits are available in the Documents and
Maps Department at Daley Library at the University of Illinois of Chicago (UIC)
or in the city's Freedom of Information Office, Department of Buildings in City
Hall, 121 N. LaSalle St. (see next page).
For ease of access, we suggest that you first try the UIC library. However, if
your house was built after June 1954, they will not have a copy of your permit and
you must go to the Freedom of Information Office.
If you are requesting a copy of a permit through the Department of Buildings
you must complete a City of Chicago Department of Buildings Customer Service
Request Form. This form is available in the Freedom of Information Office, or
it can be downloaded as a PDF file from:
http://www.cityofchicago.org/buildings/Forms/index.html. The Freedom of
Information Office is a division of the Department of Buildings and retrieves
building permit records for the general public. Once you have filled out the
form, your request will be processed by the department staff within seven
working days after its receipt.
If you are doing your research at UIC, looking up your permit is a twostage process:
First
Look up your address (alphabetically by street name and then number)
in the Address Index Card File. This will tell you in which ledger book

4

YOUR HOUSE HAS A HISTORY

 your address can be found. The book number follows a bold-faced N or
W or S, depending on the section of the city; the number is also right
before PAGE. The book number approximately correlates to the year of
the permit. If a second address is noted on the index card, copy that one
as well. This is the address used prior to street renumbering in 1909.
Second
Look up the building permit for your house in the appropriate ledger
book as indicated on the address index card.
NOTE: Most of the time you'll be dealing with microfilm for one or both of
these steps.

campus. The closest CTA stop is

COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS

 The Vagaries of Permit Research
Here are some tips about building permits that might be helpful if you're having trouble locating yours or if it doesn't
have all the information you need;
Two different ledger book systems were used from 1872 to 1955
Permits from 1872 to 1911 are listed chronologically in ledger books by sections of the city (north, south, northwest,
etc.). The system is somewhat ambiguous, and is sometimes difficult to use when you're not sure how to classify the
section of the city for the property that you are looking up. Keep looking, however, because in the vast majority of cases
the permit can be found.
From 1912 to 1955 the ledger books were more comprehensive. In addition to the information found in the olderstyle ledger books, they listed the architect and summaries of the building inspector's notes during construction (e.g.
completion of excavation, foundations, framing, roof, etc.). This system is easier to use than the older one because the
legers are indexed by book and page numbers (see page 4).
The Address Index is missing some addresses between 1872 and 1911
Some addresses may not have been indexed, or cards are missing altogether. This is especially true of permits between
1872 and 1875. If you cannot find your address index card, try the following:
1) If your location is a corner property, look up the address for both streets. Sometimes a property will be listed simply
by its intersection (e.g., Dearborn and Randolph). These listings appear at the beginning of each street file.
2) Look through the ledger books based on other information. For example, you might look up a permit in the six
month period after a property was sole (see step 4, pages 11-13), on the assumption an owner would undertake new
construction soon after a property sale.
Also, keep in mind that permit records are most likely not available fore those areas that were not part of Chicago at
the time of a building's construction (see map on page 7). In this case, try neighborhood historical societies where preannexation documents are sometimes kept.
Some street addresses changed in 1909
In 1909, the City of Chicago changed its street address system for the north and west sides. While the 1909 changes
are noted on the Address Index Cards, you may need to find your house's original address to complete your research.
The Lakeside Directory for 1909 published a conversion list of old and new number (see Directories, page 13).
Records are not always accurate
While the streets and addresses may be in order, they may not be arranged by direction, so pay close attention to whether
the N., S., E., and W. portion of the address is noted and correct.
Look at adjacent street numbers, your house may have been included in a large lot development (especially if it's on a
corner).
A slightly different number from your present address may have been recorded.
Some permits included a range of numbers if they were part of a single development area.
On occasion entries are out of order.
If you can not find your street address in the index, ask for the books or microfilms from your house's approximate
building data and look through all the permits.

TIP:
If You Cannot Find Your Permit...
read through the rest of this guidebook for information on other resources which can be used as clues
to piece together the date, builder, architect and first owner of your home. Or, you can hire a research
consultant to do the work for you. Contact the Chicago Historical Society or Landmarks Preservation
Council of Illinois for more information on the availability of consultants.

 Chicago Historical Society
Research Center
Clark St. and North Ave.
(312) 642-5035 x356
Its hours are:
Tues-Sat., 10 AM-4 PM
When you enter the CHS, ask for
a pass to use the Research Center.
Take it with you to the 3rd floor
(elevators are to your left beyond
the stairs).
The center combines a number of
collections: books, prints and
photographs, archives and
manuscripts and the architecture
collection. Most collection items
are available during regular
hours but some material may
require a special appointment.
If you have questions, feel free to
call the center before visiting it.
The research specialists in the
center will ask you to fill out a
form and will explain how to use
the collection. The specialists are
also familiar with Chicago
materials in other institutions
and can refer you to them.
The research center's stacks are
"closed" which means that you
must identify the item you want,
fill out a "call slip" for it and wait
for the staff to bring it out to you.
There are also many basic
reference books on open stack sin
the reading room.
If you have any questions, just
ask. The Chicago Historical
Society encourages visitors to
make the most of the research
center's collections.

Chicago Public Library
The greatest amount of
information related to building
research is at the downtown
Harold Washington Library
Center. See appendix, pages 1617, for information on holdings,
branches and accessibility.

TIP:
Steps Three, Four, Five and Six and the Chicago Historical Society
Steps Three, Four, Five and Six are best carried out at the Chicago
Historical Society where you can begin to research your house's
construction history (what was added to it and when); discover
information on its architect, builder, and first owner; learn about
your neighborhood's development; and, if you are lucky, obtain
copies of photos of your house or street.

Step Three
Research information on the construction of your house (and any additions),
its architect (if known), and its builder.
With a copy of your house's building permit in hand, you may already have
this information - or you may have only a starting point for further research.
Below is a listing of a variety of resources available at the Chicago Historical
Society that you can use to continue your research.
Construction on your house
Fire Insurance Maps (Atlases)
Fire insurance maps offer a wealth of information. They indicate lot sizes, the
outlines of buildings, their heights and materials, any changes made to lot or buildings,
and when those changes were made (approximately). By comparing maps of the same
neighborhood in different years, you can plat the changing character of that neighborhood.
Several companies (Sanborn, Rascher, Robinson, etc.) published fires insurance
maps. These maps were periodically updated until 1949. The dates of these revisions
are listed in the front of each book.
Different holdings for these maps can also be found in the UIC library, the CHS,
and the Chicago Public Library (CPL) (Note: permit records for your house may not be
available in the City of Chicago permit records if your house was in an area that was not
annexed to the city at the time it was built.). The UIC library and the CHS have holdings
available online depending on the year of the map; these are black and white, so the
colors used to indicate building materials that appear on original fire insurance maps
can’t be distinguished. Similarly, the CPL and UIC fire insurance maps that are available
on microfilm are on black and white. The advantage to the microfilm is that it can be
copied, while the originals at the CPL and CHS are large and cumbersome, so special
arrangements for copying must be made. Additionally, the UIC Special Collections
Department has color scans of their original fire insurance maps, consult the Special
Collections librarian for the availability of these images.

be a member of the Art Institute
or obtain an "Info Pass" referral
from your local library. While
this is not as easy as simply
walking in, it is not at all difficult,
and the resources here are
fascinating. Look up the name
of your architect/builder in the
Burnham Index. The procedure
is then much the same as at the
Chicago Historical Library in
terms of filling out call slips (see
page 8).

Detail of a construction report from The Economist, 1901
Construction reports
Various newspapers and building trades magazines regularly reported
construction news based on reports received from architects' offices and building
permit applications. Look in these publications for the weeks immediately
before or following your permit date (or use a wider search if you still don't
know the exact date).
Construction reports can be found in real estate columns in the Saturday
or Sunday editions of newspapers and periodicals or in "contracts for bid"
sections of:
Inter Ocean (for the years 1872-1914)
The Chicago Tribune (1880-1939)

YOUR HOUSE HAS A HISTORY

 Step Four
Finding information on the previous owners of your house
In most cases, your permit will have given you the names of the original
owners of your house. If your permit didn't note an original owner, or if
you're interested in finding out about others that lived in your house, you
can find this information in City and County records.
In order to discover who lived in your house before you, you must have
the legal description of your property. This should be on the permit or on
your deed. Using your PIN, this information can be obtained from Office of
the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, see the staff for assistance. If you would
like to see a map of your property with a legal description, go to the city’s
Department of Transportation, Bureau of Inspection, Division of Maps and
Plats and consult the attendant.

Your next step is to go to the first floor of the same building, to the Office
of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds. Once inside, search for the stairway
down and descend to the basement.
In this large room is a series of low cabinets filled with identically bound
books. Index books can be found on the tops of the cabinets. Use the index
to identify which of the bound tract books to look in to find information on
transactions relating to your property. The index is arranged by the township
and range number (the "38-14" numbers from the example above). After finding
the section number (e.g. "15") look for the subdivision name. This will refer
you to the number for the appropriate tract book.
There is an index page in the front of each tract book that will direct
you to the correct subdivision. Then look for the appropriate block and lot
you're interested in. In a variety of handwriting from recorders of deeds
through the decades, you'll find the names of sellers and buyers, types of
transactions, and other miscellaneous information. Some of the transaction
abbreviations used are not self-explanatory. Ask at the front desk if you
need help deciphering them.
Be aware that the information found on these pages make up the clues
that you need to track down the stories of the people who lived in your house,
so don't overlook anything that you may want to follow up on later.
If there is some transaction on your tract's page that piques your interest
and you want to look at the complete transaction document, copy down the
tract page numbers in the left margin and take them into the room next door
where you fill out a form to receive the appropriate microfilm. On the microfilm
you will find more details of the legal transaction which may give you clues for
further follow up.
Learning More About The Owners of Your House
Once again, the Chicago Historical Society is the best place for you to start
this research once you know who the previous owners were. If you are following
in the footsteps of a prominent Chicagoan, try looking up his/her name in:
the CHS card catalogue
Book of Chicagoans and its successor,
Who's Who in Chicago, published in nine editions from 1905-1950
by the A.N. Marquis Company
History of Chicago (1884-86), by A.T. Andreas
History of Cook County, Illinois (1884), A.T. Andreas
If the first owner of your house wasn't a Who's Who sort, you can still discover
some information about them in city directories, telephone books, and census
reports as well as in Chicago and cook County Sources: a Genealogical and
Historical Guide (1986) by Loretto Dennis Szuc (CHS). All of these can be found
at the CHS except the census reports. For these, go to the Newberry Library.

YOUR HOUSE HAS A HISTORY

 Directories
Various types of directories are useful for providing information about
houses and their occupants. They were published by various companies, but
there are two basic types: alphabetical (by name) and reverse (by address).
See description at right.
Census Records
Census Records are a fascinating way to learn more about the people who
lived in your house. For instance, you can discover the names of everyone in
the house and their relationships to each other. Census reports came out every
10 years beginning in 1840. Due to privacy concerns, the Census Bureau delays
issuing complete records for 70 years. Consequently, the 1920 census is the last
one to have been issued. Also, the entire 1890 census was destroyed in a fire.
The most complete set of census records can be found in the Newberry
Library and the National Archives.

Types of Directories
Alphabetical Directories
There are two kinds of
alphabetical directories: "city
directories" (published 1839-1917,
1923, 1928-29) and telephone
directories (published from 1883
to present). City directories list
occupations.
Reverse Directories
These books are arranged by
address, not names of the
occupants. If you are having
trouble finding a date of
construction for you house, you
can look up the address in a
reverse directory to see when it
first appears. However, there is
no complete set of them covering
a long period of time. The CHS
has three major titles:
Polk's Directory (1928)
Chicago Cross Reference
Associations Directory
(1950,1952-53)
Haines Directory (1978 to
present)
Social Directories
These useful resources are available
at the CHS. Entries are listed both
alphabetically and by location.
The directories, however, only
covered the socially prominent
areas of the city. The two titles at
CHS are on the reference shelves in
the research center.

Census Record for 1870

Elite Directory (1884/85-1891/92)
Chicago Blue Book (1890-1916)

TIP:
Directories for older outlying neighborhoods
Directories for older outlying neighborhoods that were originally suburbs are more difficult to find for the
years before annexation (see map on page 7). If the owner of your house lived in a suburb and worked
in the city, he/she may be listed in one of the city directories, but there would be little more than their
name. There are four places to check if you live in an annexed suburb:
Your local historical society (see appendix)
The CHS (look under your neighborhood name and then "directories; in the card catalogue)
The CPL's Special Collections Divisions, Neighborhood History Research Collection census
records.

 Step Five
Finding early or original plans, drawings and photos of your house
Finding copies of the original plans, old drawings or views of your house
is not easy to do and you will be very lucky to uncover anything at all. But
you can also be pleasantly surprised.
The best place to start is with former owners. They would be more likely
to have photos of your house 10, 20, 30 years ago than any of the city's
institutions. There are however, a few public collections where you can look
for photos and plans.
If your house was built after 1955, the plan is on microfilm along with the
permit at the Department of Buildings.
The AIC and the CHS both have a small collection of plans for older
structures, which are usually indexed by architect (since these are found in
departments other than the library, please ask for information)
Older photographs of individual houses are generally not available, but
streetscape views of some blocks can be found. Visit the Prints and Photographs
Collection of the CHS to find these.

Step Six
Your Neighborhood's History
Tracing your neighborhood's history may be the easiest and most rewarding
of your searches. Many neighborhoods have formal or informal historical
societies. Look in the appendix for the names and addresses of some. At the
CHS, look up the name of your community area in the card catalogue.
You can also look in the Neighborhood History Research Collections of the
Special Collections Division of the Chicago Public Library.

A good mystery...
Historical research is often compared to reading a good mystery. By now
you should know who did it, where, with what, and maybe why. But your search
may have just begun. Our city, and its world renowned architecture, have a rich
and engrossing history. The people and institutions you've used to do your
research are ready to help you continue. Make good use of our public libraries,
our museums, our government agencies and our universities. They are a wealth
of information preserved for us and our children.
