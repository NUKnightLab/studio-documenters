 FINAL Minutes of the January 24, 2013, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
Aircraft Noise Report
The report shows the locations of the noise monitors and their noise values. It
indicates monthly and quarterly numbers for all of 2012. There were no major
changes in noise values which were due to very little change in operations or
fleet mix.
Noise Hotline Report
There has been an increase in complaints. There were 175 complaints for the
quarter of which 47 were at night. The total for the year was 493, the majority of
which came from Chicago. Previous years’ totals were under 300.
Supplemental Report – Graph Charting Number of Operations
The graph shows yearly operations from 2000 through 2012. For the year 2012
there were 249,913 operations, totaling approximately 680 per day. This was
slightly down from 255,000 in 2011 totaling 700 per day. The numbers have
declined since 2004 which was the peak, with 340,000 operations which was
approximately 930 per day. From 2009 through 2012 numbers have been close.
Chairman Baliga asked the reason for the decline and the Mr. Jackson’s
response was the economy.
Supplemental Report – Aircraft Noise Footprint
This report shows the top 20 most frequently used aircraft at the airport. The top
aircraft is the 737/700 with an average 2012 percent of operations of 50.9%, with
daily operations of 334 and a square mileage noise footprint area of 23.2. This is
followed by the 737/300 and 500 with 13.1%, with 85.9 daily operations and a
footprint area of 20.5 square miles. These aircraft are flown primarily by
Southwest Airlines and comprise 65% of the operations at the airport.
Chairman Baliga asked Mr. Jackson to clarify the footprint area square miles. Is
that stationary with the plane regardless of where it is flying? This is for a typical
aircraft arrival or departure. The measurement is peak noise value as opposed
to DNL, which would not register for that event.
The General Aviation numbers are comprised of a wide variety of miscellaneous
aircraft from single engine privately flown aircraft to corporate jets and it also
includes helicopters.
B. Status of the Midway Part 150 Study Update
Mr. Aaron Frame stated that the airport staff has been working on the update and
checking with the FAA. The remodeling has commenced and it is expected that
the completed Part 150 update draft will be ready for public notice and public
hearing sometime in the early spring. All of the members will be notified of the
scheduled date and time.
