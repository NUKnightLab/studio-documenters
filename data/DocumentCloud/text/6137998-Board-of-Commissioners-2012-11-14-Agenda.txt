PROPOSED CONTRACT
ITEM #5
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 12, 2012 from
MATTHEW B. DeLEON, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners
and
MARIA DE LOURDES COSS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with
Granicus, Inc., San Francisco, California, for a Legislative Electronic Document Management System.

 page 6
AGENDA
Meeting of November 14, 2012

SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS continued
PROPOSED CONTRACT continued
ITEM #5 cont’d
Reason:

The Legislative Electronic Document Management System (System) is an automated agenda
workflow solution that enables paperless creation, production and distribution of agendas,
back-up documents, amendments and reports for a number of Cook County legislative bodies.
The System provides effective tracking of progress through the legislative process, voting and
an integrated searchable database of proposed and approved legislation. When indexed with
our media archive, the system attaches any video of the deliberations on a given item to
provide widest possible context of legislative history on an item.
The System may enable County agencies to experience a decrease in the amount of time spent
preparing paper copies of items and supporting documentation, delivering information to
Commissioners and the President and tracking results and progress of their items.
Additionally, the System will also provide an opportunity for other county agencies with
public agendas to automate their agenda processes.
There is no connectivity between the existing Automated Board Agenda system (ABA) built
in 2008 and the existing legislative document system (“Jackets”) built in 1995. Board items
for referral to committee and entered into the ABA must be manually keyed into the Jackets
system to assign committee numbers and create committee agendas and reports. New items
and Consent Calendar items must also be manually entered into Jackets. Manual entry
between systems increases significantly the chance for error in the information, jeopardizing
the accuracy of the legislative record. As the Jackets system has aged, the Clerk’s office
experiences ongoing maintenance issues for which it is difficult to find technical support.
Cook County seeks to piggyback on an existing contract between this vendor and the Office
of the City Clerk of Chicago. Chicago is one of over 1000 municipal, county and state
governments which have contracted with Granicus to provide similar functions. Among those
are: New York City; Los Angeles City Council; King County, Washington; City of New
Orleans; the Tennessee General Assembly; City of Milwaukee; Lake County, Illinois; Miami
Dade County, Florida; City and County of San Francisco, California, among others.
It is expected that $69,900.00 will be spent on configuration, development, implementation
and training. Annual cost of the system is $66,000.00.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $267,900.00 [FY 2012: $66,000.00 - (490-441 Account); and $69,900.00 (717/018-579 Account); FY 2013: $66,000.00 - (490-441 Account); and FY 2014: $66,000.00 - (490-441
Account)]. Contract period: October 2, 2012 through September 6, 2013 with the option of two (2) oneyear extensions.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014 funds.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
October 17, 2012 is when it became apparent that Institutional Supplies and Household, Laundry,
Cleaning and Personal Care Supplies needed an infusion of funds because the balances were
insufficient to meet our needs for the remainder of the fiscal year. The account balances on that
date were $249,281.00 in Institutional Supplies and $16,576.00 in Household, Laundry, Cleaning
and Personal Care Supplies.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The accounts for the source of transferred funds were identified because of the amount of
unencumbered funds in these accounts.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
These accounts where chosen because of the unobligated surplus in Contractual Maintenance
Services, Op., Maint. and Repair of Institutional Equipment, Maintenance and Repair of Plant
Equipment and Maintenance of Facilities.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.
