TO: Detroit City Council 
FROM: David Whitaker, Director 
Legislative Policy Division Staff
DATE: October 2, 2018
RE: Supplemental Report on the MSHDA and DBA Requirements for Demolition

Contracts

The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) is submitting this supplemental report to the July 27, 2018
report on the analysis of the standards used by the Michigan State Housing Development
Authority (MSHDA) and the Detroit Building Authority (DBA) to determine whether a
demolition contractor has the experience, capacity and other quali?cations deemed necessary to
apply for and/or win a demolition contract.

This supplemental report addresses the issue of whether the DBA has standards higher than
MSHDA in regard to the quali?cations necessary to obtain a demolition contract. In short, LPD
has identi?ed that included in guidelines for awarding contracts is the requirement
that a contractor?s performance (insurance) bond convers 100 of the awarded demolition
contract. The procurement policy provides that only half or 50% of the contractor?s
performance bond can be utilized to bid on a demolition contract. The policy, by
application, raises the standard to obtain a demolition contract above that of the 
requirements, as detailed below.

As indicated in the July 27th report, the City has established under the Detroit City Code,
Section12-1 1-20.1, Board of Examiners for Wrecking Contractors (BEWC). The BEWC advises
the Director of the Building, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED)
regarding matters relating to the licensing of wrecking contractors. The City Code requires that
the BEWC shall determine by written and oral examination, the quali?cations of an applicant in
accordance with the sworn af?davit submitted. All contractors wishing to engage in demolition
work must obtain a Wrecking License before undertaking demolition work.

  
 
 

Once the Wrecking Contractor?s License is obtained from BSEED, the person or licensed entity
must then meet the procurement requirements of the City or MSHDA depending on the funding
source. The DBA has two separate contracts for the management of demolition. The Demolition
Management Agreement between the City of Detroit and the Detroit Building Authority dated
August 1 1, 2015, for the DBA to handle the City?s demolition program. However the procurement
of the contractors for City demolitions is handled by the City?s Of?ce of Contracting and
Procurement, not the DBA. Therefore, as indicated in July 27th report, once the wrecking
license has been obtained, the contractor must follow the City?s procurement process to bid and
obtain a demolition contract for City demolition projects.

The other agreement is the Demolition Management Agreement between the DBA and the Detroit
Land Bank Authority for demolitions under Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) program dated
February 2, 2015. The demolition policy for awarding contracts under the HHF program
requires that a contractor with a wrecking license have a certain capacity in order to bid on a
demolition project?s Request for Proposal (RFP). The capacity for a contractor to bid on an RFP
depends on the performance (insurance) bonding the contractor is able to obtain from their
insurance provider.

The contractor?s bond limit is divided in half or 50% and is determined as the Maximum
Capacity of the contractor. This is the amount in which a contractor can bid on an RFP. If the
RFP package is more than the contractor has available it is above the contractor?s ?Available
Capacity?. The Available Capacity is the amount a contractor has remaining from its Maximum
Capacity. An example of the process would be:

a Contractor has a bond limit of $4 million dollars. X?s Maximum Capacity is
$2 million (50% of 4 million). The RFP for demolition of 20 structures is
$550,000. If is awarded the contract for the 20 structures this will reduce
X?s Maximum Capacity of $2 million and leave with an Available Capacity
of $1,450,000. If chooses to bid on another RFP while the previous contract
is still outstanding, can only bid on within its Available Capacity of
$1,450,000.

- Contractor has a bond limit of $1 million dollars. Y?s Maximum Capacity is
$500,000 (50% of 1 million). The RFP for demolition of 5 structures is
$125,000. If is awarded the contract for the 20 structures this will reduce
Y?s Maximum Capacity of $500,000 and leave with an Available Capacity
of $375,000.

The DBA has the ability to assemble different size RFP packages that will allow contractors with
varying degrees of bond limits to bid on prospective RF P?s.l The DBA policy also provides that

each RF must have no less than three (3) eligible, active contractors as of the release date of the
RFP. The DBA will utilize the Available Capacity of each contractor to determine the number of

 

It is the intent to allow more contractors the ability to bid by limiting the maximum capacity to 50% of the
contractor?s bonding capacity. The DBA believes the 50% maximum capacity prevents those entities with multiple
millions in bonding capacity from capturing all the due to their ability to obtain higher insurance bonding,
squeezing out contractors will lower bonding ability.

eligible contractors for a particular RFP. If the DBA receives only one bid on an RFP, the DBA
will return the bid to the contractor and withdraw the RFP as a non-competitive bid.

The procurement policy for demolition contracts is used with respect to the DLBA
demolition management contract which require compliance with the MSDHA Blight Elimination
Program Operations (Guidelines) for the HHF program. July 27th report details 
minimum requirements that a contractor must meet in order to bid on a MSHDA demolition
contract.

The MSHDA Blight Elimination Program minimum requirements include; provide evidence
of a minimum of ?ve (5) years of proven experience providing professional licensed demolition
services or similar scope/scale; (ii) secure a performance bond in an amount equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the total contract amounts; provide evidence of ?nancial stability? review
?nancial statements, two years corporate tax returns or two years audited ?nancials; provide
evidence of License and certi?cation? State and local license/certi?cation to complete work; and
evidence of Insurance- Commercial general liability coverage of no less than $2,000,000 workers
compensation; and employer?s liability coverage of no less than $500,000 as well as automobile
liability with limits not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence. Professional liability with coverage
no less than $1,000,000. These requirements are in addition to the requirements necessary to
receive a wreckng license from the City.2 If the MSHDA requirements are met the contractor
can bid on demolition contracts under the HHF program.

However, the DBA policy takes the total of the performance (insurance) bond secured by a
contractor and divides it in half or by ?fty percent The half or ?fty percent is the
Maximum Capacity a contractor has to bid on a contract. The MSHDA requirement that a
contractor?s performance bond be in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the total contract
amount, is met because the contractor is able to bid on a contract as long as the performance
bond equals the amount of the contract. The half of the performance bond under the DBA policy
cannot be less than one hundred percent of the total demolition contract. For example:

Contractor has secured bonding in the amount of $1 million. Under the DBA
policy, the Maximum Capacity of is $500,000. If the RFP package for
demolition contract is $300,000 Contractor is able to bid on the contract under
both the MSHDA guidelines and the DBA policy. If the RFP package for
demolition contract is for $600,000 Contractor would not be eligible to bid on
the contract under the DBA policy even though the total amount of secured
bonding is 1 million.

While the DBA 50% bond capacity policy does not Violate requirement of having a
performance bond equal to the amount of the total contract, it does reduce the ability of a
contractor to bid on a greater number of demolition contracts. Under the example provided
above, if the contractor had a $1 million secured performance bond, under MSHDA guidelines
the contractor could bid on both the $3 00,000 and the $600,000 bid contract. Under the DBA
policy the contractor would have a Maximum Capacity of $500,000 and could only bid on one of
the two contracts. According to the DBA, this would allow another contractor the ability to bid

 

2 The requirement necessary to obtain a Wrecking License is detailed in June 28, 2018, Report on the
Demolition Program?s Contracting Procedures and Policies.

3

on the contract providing more opportunity to other contractors under the HHF program.
Therefore, under the requirements to bid on demolition contracts, it appears the DBA imposes a
higher standard than MSHDA with regard to a contractor?s eligibility as determined by bonding
capacity to bid on a demolition contract.

If we can be of further service, please call upon us.
