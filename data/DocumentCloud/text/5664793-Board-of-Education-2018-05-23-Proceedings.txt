SCOPE OF SERVICES: . .

Vendor will continue to provide the integrated, centralized library automation system, Library Solution for
Schools, including all selected enhancement products and related services. The library automation
software will provide a searchable catalog of library collections and to automate administrative tasks such
as the circulation of library materials among patrons and the generation of library statistics and reports. 
The integrated library automation system will include Web- based Online Public AcceSs Catalog,
Cataloging and Authority Control, Circulation, Serials Controls, and Reporting capabilities. In addition to
this core functionality. the system will support integrated searching of print and electronic resources and
the inclusion of vendor and third?party supplied content such as images of book jackets, book reviews,
reading level data, and author information. Should the Board desire to expand the functionality of the-
systemin the future, the system is capable of supporting  nter-Library Loan, Textbook Management,
Classroom Library Management, and Materials Booking. The Vendor will continue to provide
implementation services including project management and training services.

DELIVERABLES:

and enhancement services, help desk design and deployment, and software technical support, upgrades
and maintenance as required by the Board.

48

May 23, 2018

OUTCOMES:
Vendor's services will result in:

Effective Material Integration: Teachers and librarians can use an integrakd library
system for a multitude of'purposes, from posting reading lists, bibliographies and path?nders online to?
creating easy title searches by reading program. Furthermore, library professionals are freed from the
time consuming task of manually performing the circulation and cataloging functions of running a library.
This change enables them to spend more time working with students an collaborating with teachers.

Collection Development: Schools and-the Board can use the system to identify 'collectiOn gaps, determine
collection age, and understand resource usage trends, thereby driving better purchase decisions. In
addition, librarians can electronically share collection information with other librarians considering similar
purchases. 

Library Automation. An integrated library system will provide bene?ts On two levels. First, all schools will
have a state-of- the-art fully maintained system. Second, a centralized system will relieve librarians and
tech coordinators of the time-consuming administrative tasks associated with independent systems, such
as the purchasing of systems and servers, installing upgrades and backing-up data. Again, this is
valuable time that can now be spent with students.

Use of Online Resources: CPS libraries currently invest $155,000 of grant funds annually in online
subscription databases Gale/Cengage, Britannica). An integrated library system will
increase the use of these databases, as they can be included in a variety of searches, thereby
dramatically expanding the quantity of rescurces that students use.

Coordination ofLibrary Technology with other technology in the school: The centralized system will
interface with other district-wide and school databases, such as the Board's student information system,
IMPACT. Furthermore, students and educators will be able to access the library from all school
classrooms with an intemet connection, transforming a basic computer into a virtual extension of the
library.

Grant Applications and Implementation: Most library grant applications require detailed information about
library collections and trends. Furthermore, the. ability to be accountable for speci?c goals is a major driver
of success in attaining grants. Without library automation, even basic questions sUch as "number of books
in collection" or ?percent increase in circulation? are nearly impossible to answer without .a manual Count.
A centralized system will allow both schools and districts to instantly address these questions with
pre-deveiOped reports.

OpordinatiOn of school and public library rescurces and services. A centralized system is a prerequisite
for coordination among schools and with the public library system, as it enables searching of all schools'
and, potentially, the Chicago Public Library's records. In addition, the system can be used to loan
resources across the district.
