Communication dated June 21, 2019 (received June 21st) requesting
Commission approval of a settlement in the matter of Philip Kozlowski v Wayne
County, et al. (U.S. District Court-Eastern District of Michigan Case No. 16-cv14164) in the amount of $50,000; Corporation Counsel has reviewed the litigation
and is of the opinion that a discussion of trial or settlement strategy in connection
with specific pending litigation in an open meeting will have a detrimental
financial effect on the County’s litigation or settlement position, therefore, a
Closed Client-Counsel Session is requested; if approved, the proposed
settlement will be charged to Account No. 101 92501 911140 (Non
