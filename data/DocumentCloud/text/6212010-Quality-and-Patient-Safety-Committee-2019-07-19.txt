 Excess Days – Plan• Top Performing Measures

• Opportunity for Improvement

• Pneumonia

• Heart Failure: 3 domains
1. Inpatient management
(targeting high risk and advanced
heart failure)

2. Discharge process
(Cardiology APN for discharge)
3. Transitions of care
(4 Flex (inpatient unit) piloting
post-discharge calls)

What we are currently doing

• Enhance Nursing Education regarding
C. diff infections, etiology and impact

•
•
•
• Develop a nurse driven protocol enabling
•
a nurse to send specimens for a C. diff
test without an order within the first 48
•
hours of admission based on RN
assessments and patient report
• Expand hand hygiene campaign with
further monitoring for both hand
hygiene and applying/removing personal
protective equipment

Goal is to decrease C. diff infections by 40% (SIR 0.6) by 12/19

 Current Processes for VTE and HAPI prevention
• Quarterly Prevalence surveillance with action planning (Incidence surveillance
to be added in September)
• Braden Assessment and VTE(venous thromboembolism) Risk Assessment
• Inclusion of at risk patients and prevention strategies during hand off
• Optimization of mechanical devices such as sequential compression devices
(SCD) to prevent VTE
• Turning Clock and Turning Schedules
• Wound/Ostomy nurses serving as consultants to physicians and staff receiving
notification of all at risk patients

17

 Planned Interventions-VTE
Current State:
Future State:
*Inpatient units have sequential compression
*Evaluate use of sequential compression
devices for inpatients
devices for outpatients
*a risk assessment tool for VTE
undergoing procedures > 1 hour or
requiring anesthesia
*Create a standard VTE prevention plan
for all areas such as endoscopy

Identify all areas with
patients at risk for VTE

18

Implement process for
assessment of risk and
implementation of
sequential compression
devices or
pharmacologics

Provide processes for
continuous quality
improvement

 Planned Interventions-Pressure Ulcer
Project aim: To recommend, develop and implement evidence-based practices relative to skin care
and pressure injury prevention and intervention at Cook County Health System
GOAL: Decrease HAPI by 15% by 11/2019
Reduce all HAPI to meet unit-specific NDNQI Benchmark for 3 out of 4 quarters in FY 19-20
