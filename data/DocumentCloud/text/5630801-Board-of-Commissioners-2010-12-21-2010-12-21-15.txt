N/A
EXPLANATION
The Chicago Housing Authority is required to submit for approval by the Board, a balanced
annual Comprehensive Budget detailing each of its funding sources General Fund, American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act Funds, Section 8 Non-MTW fund, HOPE VI and Other Grant
Programs, and the use of budgeted funds.
The FY2011 Comprehensive Budget totaling $917.3 million includes the following fund
categories:
•

General Fund. Total revenue for FY2011 is $823.7 million. The General Fund
combines the Low-Rent, Capital and Section 8 programs into a block grant as allowed
by HUD under the Amended and Restated MTW agreement. Total General Fund
revenues consist of Dwelling Rental Income, Interest Income, Administrative Fee
Income, Capital Grant Funds, Housing Assistance Subsidy, Operating Subsidy and
Other Income.

•

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) – Formula Fund. Total
revenue totals $7.0 million. ARRA funding dollars awarded to the Authority were
based on a federally derived formula which allocated funds to Housing Authorities
across the country in an effort to help stimulate the U.S. economy. For FY2011,
these funds will be used at various CHA developments for capital related work.

•

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) – Competitive Fund. Total
revenue totals $31.5 million. ARRA funding dollars awarded to the Authority were
based on a competitive process which allocated funds to Housing Authorities across
the country in an effort to help stimulate the U.S. economy. For FY2011, these funds
will be used at various CHA mixed income, senior and family developments for

 capital related work.
•

Section 8 Fund (Non-MTW). Total revenue for these program totals $8.1 million.
These contracts provide appropriations for approximately 1,338 of Mod Rehab
vouchers and 50 Mainstream vouchers for housing assistance based on annual
contributions contracts from HUD.

•

Hope VI Fund. Total revenue totals $37.8 million. These funds are used to support
relocation, demolition, revitalization, community and supportive services programs.

•

Other Funds. Total revenue totals $9.2 million. Revenue consists of federal, state
and local grants that will be used for redevelopment and demolition work at various
mixed income communities and LeClaire courts; and to enhance or augment funding
for critical programs and services that the CHA provides to its residents.

The estimated sum of all revenues for fiscal year 2011 and the amount of fiscal year 2010 fund
balance available for appropriation in fiscal year 2011 is equal to the estimated sum of all
expenditures to be made or incurred during fiscal year 2011 and the amount of all unpaid
liabilities at the beginning of fiscal year 2011.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to adopt the
FY2011 Comprehensive Budget.
