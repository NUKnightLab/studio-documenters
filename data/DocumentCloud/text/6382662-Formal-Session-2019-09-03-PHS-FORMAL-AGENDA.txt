XAVIER STRICKLAND ORDINANCE MODIFICATION OPINION

My office has received numerous calls from community residents concerned about the
strength of the Xavier Strickland Ordinance after the horri?c demise of Emma Hernandez

at the

mouths of three vicious dogs. I am requesting an opinion on the legality of

modifying the Xavier Strickland Ordinance to:

1.

4

Allow the Animal Control officers to more easily seize dogs that pose a threat to public
health, safety and welfare.

Allow the City of Detroit to set a pre-determined monetary value on the lives of dogs,
similar to some jurisdictions where livestock have a predetermined monetary value in
case of accidental death.

Implement a requirement that all dogs residing within Detroit be neutered, or a breeding
license be purchased by the owner to keep a non-neutered dog in the City.

Require dog owners to purchase higher levels of liability insurance.

Please provide the information by 27 September 2019. If you have any questions do not
hesitate to contact my of?ce at, 313-224-1198.
