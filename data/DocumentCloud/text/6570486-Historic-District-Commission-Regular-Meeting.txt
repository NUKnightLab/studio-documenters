STAFF REPORT: 12-11-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6584
ADDRESS: 3480 CAMBRIDGE
HISTORIC DISTRICT: SHERWOOD FOREST
APPLICANT: SEAN SOROKA, BOBSON CONSTRUCTION
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 12/3/2019

PREPARED BY: A. DYE

SCOPE: FRONT PORCH COLUMN REPLACEMENT
EXISTING CONDITIONS
This 1926 Colonial Revival house has a symmetrical front elevation which is carried through the roofline
due to the shed dormer on each elevation of the hip roof. The heavy/wide columns at the front porch create
a sharp contrast to the minimal details of the brick façade, where the only ornament is found with the brick
arches over the first floor window openings that are filled with brick laid in a Jack-on-Jack pattern.
An iron railing adds a light decorative touch and allows the porch to retain its visual dominance. The
circles spanning the space between the straight spindles helps to draw out the subtle detail of the brick
arches, unifying the front elevation.

PROPOSAL
The contractor states the existing columns are hollow, lack structural integrity, have rotted beyond the point
of repair and need to be replaced with new structural columns. The contractor selected columns from
columnpost.com.

 The comparison of dimension are below. The concrete bases are to remain.
Cap

Existing
21” x 21”

7-0”

Proposed
19-3/32” x 19-3/32”
16”
13-1/8”
7-0”

The difference in dimension is approximately 13% thinner for each column component. The applicant
didn’t supply comparative dimensions for the height of each component. The columns on the house have
continuous fluting, whereas the replacement columns have fluting that stops a number of inches above the
base. Please refer to Page 9 of the attached product catalog.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
While it is evident the columns are suffering from deferred maintenance with some visible loss of wood, it
is not clear to staff the columns are beyond repair. Also, the upper porch seems stable, especially since this
is not part of the broader repair project (which includes a new flat roof on the upper porch). Therefore, the
structural integrity of the entire porch system seems to be intact.
ISSUES
With the structural issues aside, the proposed columns do not match the existing in both size (diameter)
and fluting. There is no mention in the project description that the pilasters will be replaced.
The heft of the existing columns are the dominant feature to the front of this house. Maintaining the
existing dimensions and details (i.e. full fluting) are imperative to retaining the architectural and historical
character of the building, as well as guaranteeing the diameters of the four vertical components match.

 RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion the removal of the existing columns and installation of the proposed composite columns
will alter features that characterize the property.
Therefore staff recommends the Commission deny a COA for the column replacement as they do not meet
the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation, especially:
#2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided
#6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. When the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in
design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of
missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.

elegance

Just imagine beautiful flutes encircling a column then
topped with flowing scrolls and leaves on a decorative
capital and superbly completed with graceful details
of a stylish base. The Column & Post Corinthian Order of Fluted
Columns is considered to be one of the most ornate column designs.
Traditionally, fitted with Roman Corinthian Capitals and Attic Bases,
Column & Post fluted columns are consistently the highest quality
decorative column available.
Our attractive deep flutes are sculpted into the column master.
These flutes provide long crisp shadow lines. Whether configured
in a colonnade along a veranda or positioned on the sides of a
dining room entry, fluted columns will complement the ambiance
of these elegant spaces.

functional

Our standard Tuscan capitals and bases are cast from the same rock hard composite
material as our column shaft assuring maximum durability. This material is superior to withstanding
punishment from snow shovels, pressure washers, weed eaters, and general wear and tear. Although casting capitals and
bases from this material requires extra attention to detail, we think you will agree it is worth the effort. We also offer attic
and low profile designs to meet your specific needs.

Custom Cuts and Products
Getting you exactly what you need is a principal element of our business.
Your satisfaction is a main concern at Column & Post. We understand that
dimensions vary by project. Sometimes the post height is a little taller than
a standard 8x8 or a column needs to be slightly short of 18 feet. Whatever the
requirement, our personnel can make the modifications that suit the needs
of your endeavor.

Plan Types
Just like custom lengths can be required to properly fit an opening, it is
sometimes necessary to make vertical cuts. The scope of your project may call
for the use of half columns or posts as pilasters or maybe you need a quarter
cut column for a room corner. We have the ability to meet your specifications.

Split columns can add an

Good morning Jennifer,
See attached in regards to the job at the above address. It is our professional opinion that
these columns cannot be repaired. (See photos of exiting). 
I have attached photos of what we are proposing to replace them with. Also the
manufacturer website is below. 
In regards to the roof color, the photo is what the customer has selected.
Please let me know how we may proceed.
Thanks!

Round Columns

Classic
Design

From the
celebrated
and historic
cities of
Europe, to
charming and
welcoming

 

front porches
across
America, the
Tuscan
column is one
of the most
recognizable

 

 

architectural
elements the
world over.

 

The Tuscan
column and
its timeless

 

elegance

have been featured on the work of architects and

builders since ancient times.

Our Column Post Collection sets the standard for
quality in the industry. ISlur on~premise craftsmen
have meticulously recreated the fine decorative
details and the true Tuscan taper as outlined by
?v?itruvius and Palladio. Combine a passion for
preserving the classic shape with technologically
advanced composite materials and the result is the

most beautiful. high performance column available.

Jennifer,
See attached for an updated scope of work. The only things left to send I believe would be the
project review request and building permit. I can send that when our notoriety is here to sign
off on the permit. Other than that photos and what not should be set. See below for
dimensions and reasons the columns must be replaced.
*the existing columns are hollow. In our case they have rotted out to a point beyond repair
and lack structural integrity. This is why they must be replaced with new structural columns.
*Existing column dimensions:
22-1/2 x 22-1/2 concrete base to remain
21”x21” Cap
18” dia column bottom
15-3/4” dia column top
7’-0” High
*New Dimensions of proposed columns:
21-5/16” x 21-5/16” base
19-3/32” x 19-3/32” cap
16” dia column bottom
13-1/8” dia column bottom
7’-0” High
If you have any questions please let me know. Everything else should be in the previous
emails.

Jennifer,
As you requested, See the attached existing roof photos and scope of work. If possible We
would like to get the roof taken care of as soon as we can. The columns we can do later after
your departments approval. Please let me know how we may proceed.
I will have the review request and paper work for the columns over to you soon as well.
Thanks
