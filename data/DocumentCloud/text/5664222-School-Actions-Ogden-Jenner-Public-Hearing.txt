7

MR. METCALF:

So this meeting is a part

8

of the proposed Ogden and Jenner consolidation

9

which was formally proposed on December 1, 2017,

10

following months of community engagement leading

11

up to the announcement.

12

Metcalf and I am the network chief for Network 6

for Chicago Public Schools.

My name is Brian

I am also here with Cheryl Nevins from

18

basic information and hear from you, the most

19

important part, about the specific proposal.

20

We are here today on behalf of our

6

purpose of this meeting is to allow CEO Jackson

the specific proposal under discussion.

MS. NEVINS:

Thank you, Brian.

Welcome, everyone.
First of all, I'd like to just note

19

that Dr. Jackson wanted to make it a priority

20

that any parents that are here now that are part

21

of this action, we have the first two rows

22

reserved for you.

23

move up, please feel free so that you can hear

and see at any point in time.

So if anyone would like to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 9

So this meeting tonight is obviously a

2

part of a larger picture and a broader timeline

3

regarding this proposal.

4

published draft guidelines for school actions,

5

and on December 1st we sent notice of those --

6

of the proposed actions as well as draft

7

transition plans.

8

where there will be two community hearings that

9

will occur, the first of which is tonight, the

So on October 1st CPS

And now we're here in January

10

second one which is one week from tonight at

11

Jenner, and there will be a hearing at the Board

12

as well for the third opportunity.

13

The earliest that the Board can vote on

14

this proposed action is in February.

15

the three opportunities for community input, the

16

CPS -- CPS will make a recommendation on behalf

17

of the CEO to the Board regarding whether or not

18

the Board should vote on this proposal.

19

So after

We're here after a long process.

As

20

many of you know already, so many activities

21

have gone on and occurred.

22

committee formed and that steering committee is

23

made up of faith leaders, Reverend Leahy and

24

Rabbi Limmer.

We have a steering

We have a Jenner and Ogden
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 10

teacher on that, as well as members of the

2

Jenner and Ogden community.

3

We have also held three well-attended

4

community meetings, one back in February, one

5

back in March, and one back in April of 2017,

6

and we've also seen this past year many of the

7

activities have gone on with Jenner and Ogden

8

students learning together through their JOLT

9

activities as well as a single story through the

10

SEED program that has worked with the staff at

11

Jenner and Ogden.

12

Through this process and through this

13

community engagement some of the things that we

14

have heard from all of you, the desire to keep

15

the International Baccalaureate program while

16

providing robust supports for the students, a

17

desire to maintain Jenner's strong culture

18

including the N.E.S.T. philosophy.

19

Some of the other issues that we have

20

heard are transportation, so there will be

21

transportation provided between Jenner and

22

Ogden, as well as the current activities and

23

events to continue to bring the two communities

24

together, Grades K to 4 at Ogden East as well as
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 11
1

Grades 5 to 8 at Jenner.

2

There was also an idea and a notion to

3

make sure that Jenner's current 8th graders

4

would have a seat at Ogden High School if they

5

so chose to attend.

6

We have also heard about the pre-K

7

program.

8

and we're hoping through community engagement we

9

will hear more activities and ideas from all of

10
11

It's a necessity for Jenner families,

you tonight.
So with respect to the proposed changes

12

that would occur this fall, Ogden International

13

would have three buildings.

14

expanding Ogden's boundary to include the

15

current Jenner boundary.

16

high school, that would still remain at the

17

Ogden West campus and it will serve Grades 9

18

through 12.

19

current year would be allowed to attend Ogden

20

West if they chose.

21

We would be

24 West Walton would be for K through

3

Some of the details of the proposal --

4

and again you can find more details in the

5

actual transition plan that some of you may have

6

received on December 1st.

7

at the website cps.edu\transitions.

8
9

If not, it's online

Some of the exciting details are that
CPS has budgeted approximately 1.8 million over

10

the next three and a half years to support the

11

transition of these students.

12

In addition, we have already committed

13

to some staffing supports which would be, but

14

are not limited to, an assistant principal at

15

each of the schools, a school counselor and a

16

school clerk at each of the three buildings, a

17

principal and a school-based transition

18

coordinator to assist with the transition.

19

school-based transition coordinator is the

20

person for parents and students to make the

21

transition as seamless as possible.

22

also this semester train Jenner teachers in the

23

IB curriculum.

24

The

We would

the creation of a Culture and Climate team

2

implementing the Responsive Classroom and SELF

3

program as well as committing to a restorative

4

practice coach from Central Office for at least

5

once a week.

6

These are some of the social and

7

emotional supports to support students during

8

this transition process.

9

supports, as you can see, transportation will be

Some of the logistic

10

provided between Jenner and Ogden East.

11

continue to discuss staggered start times so

12

that parents that have students at multiple

13

campuses, that it eases the burden on them.

14

We will

We will review the need for additional

15

Safe Passage Program or any other implements

16

from CT Security, and ODLSS will work with

17

individual families, and that representative is

18

here tonight to help guide individual families

19

through this process.

20

And that's it.

That's some of the

21

details on the transition plan.

22

read the plan in detail, which is a draft at

23

this time, on the CPS website.

24

MR. METCALF:

Thanks, Cheryl.

Before

2

we go into the public comment and public

3

feedback, if members of the student committee

4

can just raise your hand for us, this group of

5

people were really intentional about working

6

over the last few years.

7

round of applause?

8

Can we give them a

(Applause.)

9

MR. METCALF:

This group has been one

10

of the highlights of my transition into this

11

role.

12

transitions people that I have met, and they

13

really wanted to make sure that at the district

14

level all of these supports that you see here in

15

this limited transition plan work, so I just

16

wanted to acknowledge them for their hard work,

17

the long hours, the many days and the incredible

18

amazing work that they've done.

19
20
21

They are some of the most thoughtful

Now for public comment.

Alderman, are

you -- okay.
So we will have some ground rules for

22

public comment as we proceed to this section.

23

During public participation each speaker that

24

signed up will have two minutes to share their
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

Page 15

thoughts.

2

mark and then a 30-second warning mark, and then

3

you will have allotted all of your time.

4

You will get a one-minute warning

Speakers will be asked that you make

5

sure that you come to the side and a member of

6

the transition team will help you and organize

7

you by number.

8
9

And here is what we're asking.

We are asking that we allow those
speakers to be heard because we have someone

10

that is taking notes for us and we want to be

11

able to capture what everyone is saying.

12

Again, the meeting is scheduled to end

13

at 8:00 p.m.

14

the scheduled end time of the meeting, and so if

15

there are any remaining people that would like

16

to sign up to engage in the public comments

17

section, you still have time to go sign up at

18

the table, the registration table in the back.

19

The comment period will last until

If time remains and we conclude the

20

public comments section early, those parents or

21

community members who did not initially sign up,

22

you can continue to sign up in the back at the

23

registration table to get an opportunity to

24

speak and, likewise, if you spoke and were not
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 16
1

able to finish what you had to say in the first

2

two minutes, you can sign up again and come up

3

again.

4

Remember, we're asking, so that

5

everybody is heard, that we stick to the

6

two-minute time.

7

All right.

So let's begin.

Can I have speakers 1 through 5 line up

8

at the microphone here, speakers 1 through 5.

9

And for each, before we begin, can you make sure

10

that you state your name and your affiliation

11

with either school before you start.

12

all speakers make sure that you state and spell

13

your name and your affiliation with either Ogden

14

or Jenner.

MR. BLAKEY:

Good evening.

Again, for

My name is

16

Randall Blakey.

18

the Near North Unity Program.

19

I serve as the pastor of

The Near North Unity Program exists to

20

protect the community residents and stakeholders

21

of the community, enhances and improves the

22

quality of life for all, "all" being the

23

operative word.

24

About three years ago there was an idea
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 17
1

that was brought to the Near North Unity Program

2

by the chair of our Youth and Families

3

Committee.

4

in four different areas; youth and family,

5

safety, employment, and language and

6

development.

7

The Near North Unity Program works

About three years ago there was an idea

8

that was brought to our attention when we

9

learned that Jenner was under-enrolled and that

10

Ogden was over-enrolled.

11

possible merger of the two so that one wouldn't

12

have to close and so forth and so on.

13

That idea was a

Another thing that came out of the

14

Youth and Family Committee is a quality of life

15

plan, a community quality of life plan that

16

calls for an equitable education throughout this

17

entire community.

18

one of the ways to achieve equitable education

19

in this community but also to bring about

20

cross-cultural learning.

We see this opportunity as

21

There was a judge, Thurgood, Marshall

22

that said, Unless our children learn how to --

23

unless our children have an opportunity to learn

24

together, they will never be able to live
TOOMEY REPORTING

together.

2

proponents of children being able to learn from

3

each other and particularly when they are

4

different from each other.

5

So we have always been strong

The last thing that I would say is that

6

over these last three years one of the things

7

that has been our foundation is having the right

8

attitude and the right approach to this

9

particular endeavor.

We believe that the right

10

attitude gives you the fortitude to overcome all

11

obstacles.

12

have had not had disagreements, that we have not

13

all been on the same page.

14

We are not saying at all that we

But one of the things that we have

15

approached this opportunity with is the right

16

attitude, and that right attitude has seen us

17

through those three years and seen us here

18

tonight.

312-853-0648

Page 19

excitement and support for the merger of Jenner

2

and Ogden communities.

3

to the challenges facing both of our schools and

4

it creates new opportunities for all of the

5

students.

6

It's an elegant solution

The Jenner and Ogden Community Steering

7

Committee has been tireless in their gathering

8

input, addressing concerns and moving the

9

proposal along with rigor and transparency.

I'd

10

like to acknowledge all of their hard work as

11

was done before and thank them for it.

12

The resulting CPS plan addresses the

13

concerns that have been voiced by each of the

14

two stakeholder groups throughout the process.

15

I want to thank CPS for proposing this

16

transition with a strong plan that will support

17

the students, the teachers, and the community in

18

making it a success.

19

I look forward personally to supporting

20

the transition and getting a little more

21

exercise when I walk my daughter to school next

22

year.

24

Thank you.

11

volunteer at the west campus school where I've

school year, so I spend a lot of time on campus.

14

19

completed our public school educations in

20

various homogenous communities, me here in a

21

Chicago suburb and my husband in a small village

23

once we finished school, we had to learn how to

navigate successfully in a diverse work world

cultural and family histories were not like our

In today's more complex world, our

children will need these skills even more than

we did, judging the people they come in contact

and not culture or family history.

students, both from Ogden and from Jenner, will

I'm the

Tonight I once again ask CPS and the

20

Board of Ed to support and vote for the planned

21

Jenner-Ogden merger proposal.

22

merger plan solves serious facility utilization

23

issues at both Jenner and Ogden schools.

24

The Jenner-Ogden

Campus sharing also wisely maximizes
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

Page 23
1

the use of scarce CPS financial resources, but

2

most of all the merger plan expands and supports

3

additional student access to high quality IB

4

education for the entire Near North side, all of

5

this while quietly blending two schools' culture

6

and children into an amazing new type of

7

integrated neighborhood school, the type of

8

school Chicago so desperately needs.

9

The benefits of this type of school

10

throughout the CPS process that we've just

engaged in, a community engagement process that

13

currently has been formed and worked with the

14

Jenner Ogden Steering Committee and partnered

15

with by CPS, a community engagement process that

16

might seem new to some of you but a process that

17

actually dates back at least to 2013 when the

18

then CPS network chief Linda Williams in her

19

public testimony recognized the importance of

20

programs like IB for student success at Jenner.

21

There has never been more work done to

22

prepare for a CPS school consolidation than the

23

work that has been done here.

24

important prep work done by the community and

I believe this

CPS will set the stage for the most productive

2

and successful school merger our district has

3

ever seen.

4

Therefore, given the planning and

process that has taken place, I ask the Board of

6

Ed and CPS to please support and vote for the

7

proposed school action to merge.

MS. GONZALEZ:

Hello.

My name is

10

Dharma Seda Gonzalez, and I'm a senior at Walter

11

Payton.

12

In 1964, right after the historic Brown

13

v. Board decision, Malcolm X said that America

14

preaches integration yet practices segregation.

15

I also learned one thing, that it takes

16

all of us to make real change.

17

threatened by war, in a country full of hate,

18

and in a city plagued by de facto segregation,

19

this merger is a beacon of light for race

20

relations in Chicago, and it's proof that a

21

single unprecedented dream can become a reality.

22

In a world

Three years ago Michele Dreczynski had

23

a dream that a predominantly black school in

24

Cabrini-Green could merge.

She had a dream that

TOOMEY REPORTING

our diverse Near North community could work

2

together to fight for educational equity.

Michele, thank you for all your dreams.

To

We are here today because of her idea,

5

1,269 petition signatures in support of CPS and

6

everyone in this room who cares enough about

7

Chicago's children to take a stance on an issue

8

greater than ourselves.

Activity for this merger has filled me

10

with a sense of inspiration, passion, and

11

urgency to act that I have never experienced

12

before, and for that I'm very grateful.

21

hallway studying, not necessarily to keep up but

22

more often than not to jump ahead.

people that are bright, active, energetic, and

My name is Rebecca Wells and I'm a

6

parent of a 5th grader at Ogden and a member of

7

the Jenner-Ogden Community Steering Committee.

8

What I think is important for everyone in this

9

room to know is that countless hours have

10

already been invested into this proposal to

11

merge.

12

as I heard some people say and I read on various

13

Facebook posts.

This is not just being thrown together

14

Over the past two years parents,

15

community members, and teachers from both

16

schools have been working together to find the

17

best solution to our unique opportunity.

18

Tonight I actually wanted to do a little bit of

19

quick math on how many hours, how many woman and

20

man-hours we put into this, and I am venturing

21

to guess it's over 2,000 hours that's already

22

been spent, and that's on the low end it's got

23

to be.

24

So we've been asking ourselves a hard

question throughout this process.

2

pushing CPS to think outside the box making sure

3

that this is equitable for all the students,

4

honoring both school cultures and history and

5

striving to make this merger a reality.

6

believe this has the potential to be far more

7

than just another school action.

I want to thank

I guess I come from a different

standpoint.

17

tossed around, some interesting premises, and I

18

think at this point as we've absorbed

19

information, I have some questions.

20

first one would be, the plan that you have

21

that's a draft plan, this is the first plan of

22

any kind that's been presented in this whole

23

discussion over years.

24

final plan that people can really process and

I've heard some interesting things

And the

then weigh in on?

Do we know?

Another question I have is can you show

us the combined schools' data?

statistics.

6

a combined school looks like?

7

So for each

Are we going to be able to see what

Every person just about who has spoken

8

before me has hinted that diversity is good.

love diversity at Ogden.

We

That's part of why I

10

chose to live in the Ogden neighborhood and

11

participate in a neighborhood school.

12

the 10th most diverse school of 600 already.

13

is it going to be more diverse or is it going to

14

be less diverse at the end?

15

But it's

Maybe I'm the only one, but I hear 1.8

million over three and a half years as a

17

temporary thing.

18

oldest is in 3rd grade -- we've seen four

19

different principals at Ogden and three

20

different CEOs in the school system.

21

So

And in my four years -- my

I've met them all, and some of them

22

haven't left Ogden for the best reasons and some

23

of them haven't left the CEO's office for the

24

best reasons.

But what I want to speak on and

advocate for is teachers.

4

Jenner.

I've been around Jenner for over 20

years.

I lived in the community for over 20

6

years.

So Jenner is just a well-known school

7

for me and my family.

My daughter goes to

I'm advocating for the teachers, to
make sure that the teachers, the current

10

teachers that are there continue to stay there.

My daughter loves and is fond of all the

teachers at Jenner.

13

If this merger does happen, the Ogden

children will come over.

They're going to get a

19

This is what we have been doing for 50 years,

20

that if the merger occurred, we do keep the name

22

questions regarding the budget and that's

23

something that we're going to need to know and

24

learn and just make sure that everything gets

2

everything is not just peaches and cream but is

3

actually going to happen.

4

So I do want my daughter to get the

5

opportunity to have the diversity going on until

6

she gets out of elementary school because we are

7

living in a mixed community and she needs to

know her neighbors.

plan does look fine and I just hope that

only concern right now is the teachers, just to

MR. BALSAM:

Good evening.

My name is

3

Aaron Balsam, B-a-l-s-a-m, and my wife Amy and I

4

and our children live in the Jenner neighborhood

5

and we support this merger.

6

I was actually thinking I feel a little

7

like renewing my vows tonight, but basically I'm

8

sharing -- basically there's three high level

9

thoughts going forward with respect to the

10
11

merger.
First, I believe this proposal is

12

different than many you often see.

13

force students out or at best some move existing

14

students from one school to another school.

15

other words, there is no net community

16

participation from the change.

17

Many simply

In

This merger is different in that I

18

believe it will gradually increase participation

19

and pull new children into the school.

20

therefore increase on that city and state,

21

parents and families which means a growing pot

22

of tax dollars and support.

23
24

It will

Second, as families do stay in the city
longer, this will increase and sometimes defer
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 53
1

their investment in the community.

2

of investors currently is the poorest mindset

3

which stands ready to leave as soon as soon as

4

there's no market benefit.

5

mean more families stay for the long run in the

6

Near North neighborhood.

7

The mindset

This merger will

Third, I believe if we are really

8

honest, we know that something is not right

9

about the way the boundaries are drawn right

10

now.

11

a giant two-way system where one specializes in

12

post-graduate work and another set of tracks

13

leads somewhere else.

14

Our educational institutions have created

This merger eliminates previously

15

gerrymandered neighborhood boundaries and brings

16

with it all the short and long-term benefits of

17

further integration.

18

Thank you to CPS for these numerous

19

opportunities over a couple years now to provide

20

feedback.

21

or have specific questions, please do continue

22

to share constructive feedback and engage as

23

we'll continue to move forward together.

about is that CPS not view this as an

little bit of my background is I am a former CPS

22

I am also -- kind of a

I have taught on the south side of

23

Chicago in one of the low-income neighborhoods

24

as they introduced the IB curriculum to a
TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2018
Page 60
1

community very similar to the Jenner community.

2

And so speaking from a teacher's perspective

3

introducing the IB curriculum to a new student

4

set, I know it's incredibly awesome.

5

It gives the students a wonderful

6

chance to learn a different sort of environment,

7

and I know there's a lot of probably worry on

8

the Ogden parents' part of, Is my student going

9

to be held to the same level of rigor with this

10

new student integration?

11

wholeheartedly say as best as I can that I think

12

they absolutely will be kept at the same rigor

13

and they will be pushed.

14

And I can

As an Ogden student, you will be pushed

15

with these new students because it's all about

16

international mindedness and all about being

17

open-minded and thinking, and having a new

18

perspective really drives students to think on a

19

very different level.

20

teacher's perspective, I want to say that the

21

Jenner kids will greatly benefit as well as the

22

Ogden kids will greatly benefit.

23
24

And just from the

I know someone had brought up the
demographic question, and I think it has been

We will

Feel free to stay, but feel free -- if

13

you must go, we understand, but we'll be here to

14

talk.

15

So one of the things I want to make

16

sure that I talk about is this notion of the IB

17

curriculum.

18

make sure, that we will make sure is that the

19

same caliber of rigor and expectations that is

20

kind of naturally and inherently built within

21

the IB curriculum will remain in both this

22

location and in the 5-8.

23

challenging as to the IB units.

24

One of the things that we want to

So it will still be as

Teachers will be trained in how to

relates to the curriculum, nothing will change.

IB is worldwide and so those tenets that are
