PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

SCOPE: INSTALL TWO NEW STOREFRONTS AT WEST ELEVATION
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The subject property includes the 9-story building that is located at the SW corner of E. Grand Boulevard
and Beaubien that was erected in 1913 by Theo Starret Co. to serve as a storage warehouse for the Schwiwe
Storage Company. The building is currently vacant. The main facades facing E. Grand and Beaubien have four
pilasters symmetrically arranged that run the entire height of the building, stone accents, and windows with
stone sills centrally located between the pilasters. There is no fenestration on the west facade. A corner tower
on the NE corner of the building rises one floor above the roofline. Windows on the east, south, north
elevations, stories 3-9, are recently-added, aluminum ribbon, curtain wall window systems. Newly-installed
aluminum double-hung windows are also present at the east, south, and north elevations. A column of
metal louvers have been added to the rear elevation in order to vent the existing mechanical shaft. Finally,
the west elevation, which originally lacked fenestration, is due to receive new aluminum ribbon, curtain
wall windows and a projecting glass storefront entrance at the first-story, northern corner.
North Elevation, current conditions

 PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval for the following work
items:
West Elevation
• At the first story, install two new storefront entries. Each entrance will include a multi-lite, roll-up
aluminum door with an integrated single, hinged person door. The new storefronts will be black.
Rear/South Elevation (work completed)
• Install a new masonry loading dock
• Remove and partially infill one overhead door opening.
• Install two, single hinged metal pedestrian doors
• Remove the windows at the building’s western-most column and install new louvered metal vents
(to provide venting to the mechanical equipment shaft)
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• The Commission issued a Notice to Proceed to rehabilitate the project at the 6/14/2017 regular
meeting. Please see the attached staff report for the approved rehabilitation scope. A review of
current conditions and the 6/14/2017 elevation drawings indicates that the work at the rear has been
slightly modified from the version of the proposal which the Commission approved in 2017.
• The proposed two new doorways at the west elevation also represents a modification to the rehab
scope which was approved in 2017
ISSUES
• None
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work as proposed will not destroy historic materials that characterize the
property. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the
work as proposed because it meets the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation, standard #9)
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with
the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its
environment.

story brick building located on the south?west corner of E. Grand and Beaubien, built in 1913 by Theo
Starret Col, as a storage warehouse for Schwiwe Storage Company. Although it frequently changed
tenants, it continued to be used as a storage warehouse.

The main facades facing E. Grand and Beaubien have four pilasters systematically arranged that run
the entire height of the building, stone accents, and windows with stone sills symmetrically located
between the pilasters. There is no fenestration on the west facade A corner tower on the north east
corner of the building rises one floor above the roofline.

The subject property is currently under construction which was previously approved by your office and a
building permit has been issued by the City of Detroit Building Safety and Engineering Department. At
this time we are requesting your approval so we can design and submit drawing to construct to open the
second two bays south of E. Grand Blvd. on the west side of the building at the first floor to create a
connection between the first floor and the exterior patio area. Each bay would have a roll up aluminum
full view doors and a pedestrian door to connect the interior space to the exterior patio. The aluminum
color will be Black [Anodized] [Brochure and Detailed Shop Drawing Attached]

ANTICIPATED CHALLENGES
The historic purpose of the building was cold storage. The proposed use for the
structure is more consistent with the heritage of the neighborhood and district, but
the lack of access to daylight is prohibitive to attract the tenants they seek for the intended use. Accessing daylight in a way that is responsive to the historic character
of the building and surrounding context is our objective.

PRESERVATION OF DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER
The distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship
that characterize this property are most predominantly located at the base of the building
and around the towers and parapet. The intent is to preserve or rehabilitate these features of
original woodwork at the main entry, and ornate limestone and brick detailing.
