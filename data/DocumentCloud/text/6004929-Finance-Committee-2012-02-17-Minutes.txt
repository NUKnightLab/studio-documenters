III. Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
This item will be presented for consideration and approval at the February 24, 2012 Meeting of the Board of
Directors.
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Committee’s
review and discussion.
John Cooke, Director of the Cook County Office of Capital Planning and Policy, provided an update on
activities relating to request number 1; this was a request to increase and extend the contract with Jones Lang
Lasalle Americas, Inc., for real estate consulting services relating to the adaptive re-use of Cook County
Hospital. Mr. Cooke indicated that the administration has decided to not proceed with prior direction and
plans (which involved using tax increment financing funding for the renovation), and will be reviewing all
possibilities regarding the re-use and funding of the redevelopment and restoration of the old Cook County
Hospital. Additionally, Mr. Cooke stated that these activities will be taken a step further; other stakeholders
from the Medical District will be included in the discussions to get their input.
Chairman Carvalho noted that request number 6 relates to the System’s preparedness for the transition to
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-10). A recent
communication from the United States Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius
indicated that the date for compliance with ICD-10 has been postponed; Chairman Carvalho inquired whether
this postponement will cause the System to defer its readiness activities. Dan Howard, System Chief
Information Officer, responded in the negative. He indicated that the System needs to continue its preparations
since many of the steps on the path to ICD-10 implementation are steps the System needs to take anyway; he
noted that three documents (Attachment #2) were submitted to the Committee that provide further information
on the subject.

C. Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items
There were no Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items for the Committee to review and discuss.

D. Approval of Transfer of Funds requests
Kimberly Velasquez, Acting System Director of Budget, stated that there were no Approval of Transfer
requests for the Committee to review and discuss at this time; she noted that this will now be a standing item
for the Committee’s agenda.
Ms. Velasquez provided an overview of the process for approval of transfers of funds. Included in the FY2012
Budget Resolution approved by the County Board, as it relates to System transfer of funds, was the
requirement that the System Board approve transfers of funds greater than $10,000; any transfer of funds in an
amount less than $10,000 is submitted to the County’s Director of Budget for his or her consideration and
approval.

E. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Notification of Emergency Purchases
There were no Emergency Purchases for the Committee to review and discuss.

B. Report of purchases made under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #3)
Ms. Besenhofer presented the report of purchases made under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer, for
the period of November 2011 through January 2012.

C. Financial Reports through December 2011 (Attachment #4)
Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports through December 2011. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Committee discussed the subject of budget projections for revenues and expenses. Chairman Carvalho
inquired whether monthly revenue and expense projections are calculated by dividing the annual total of
revenue or expense by twelve months, or whether they are calculated based upon anticipated, realistic
expectations of what and when the System will receive in funding or will need to spend at a specific time. Ms.
Loving responded that, with regard to revenue projections, management has tried to spread the revenue
projections to match when a funding is expected to be received. However, with regard to expense projections,
Ms. Loving stated that there is not enough information available to be able to anticipate when expenses will be
presented and processed for payment. Chairman Carvalho cautioned that means that expenditures will tend to
show as “under budget” in the early part of the year, since the System is usually not geared up to spend new
authority right from the start of the year.
Chairman Carvalho referenced the State’s website that provides information on the dollar amount of charity
care provided by Illinois hospitals; he noted that the amount reported for the System appears to be much lower
than it should be. He inquired whether System staff is reviewing this issue, to ensure accuracy in the reporting
of this information. He added that public policy decisions are based on these data, so accuracy is of utmost
importance. John Cookinham, System Interim Chief Financial Officer, responded that staff is making a very
concerted effort to enroll patients in CareLink; he stated that the System will be able to provide monthly
information on patients enrolled in CareLink, which will give management much more accurate information on
free care provided. Ms. Loving stated that the amount of charity care included in the audited financial
statements, prepared by the external auditors, is significantly higher than the amount reported on the State’s
website. Chairman Carvalho stated that the information received by the State is prepared by someone at the
System and it is the responsibility of management to submit accurate information to the State; he informed
management that the new questionnaire from the State is expected to be sent out next month, so management
will be able to anticipate and respond to the questionnaire with the most accurate information.

A. Update on Revenue Cycle Initiatives (Attachment #5)
John Cookinham, System Interim Chief Financial Officer, presented an update on Revenue Cycle Initiatives.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding information on pending Medicaid applications. Mr. Cookinham
responded that the information was not included in this presentation, but he will provide it to the Committee.

A. Update on Revenue Cycle Initiatives (continued)
Chairman Carvalho referenced public testimony provided earlier that day, at the Human Resources Committee
Meeting, regarding challenges experienced and questions relating to the CareLink enrollment process. The
person providing testimony stated that her parent is eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and was experiencing
problems with the CareLink enrollment process. Chairman Carvalho added that there were questions relating
to receiving care during this enrollment process. Mr. Cookinham stated that, for those patients with dual
eligibility, the System will first bill Medicare and then bill Medicaid for the services provided. He believed
that the System can qualify an individual for CareLink within thirty days, as long as the patient is able to
supply the System with the proper information to document their discount status. It was noted that Mr.
Cookinham would further discuss the matter with the individual, following the meeting.

B. Financial Dashboard
Chairman Carvalho stated that this item will be discussed at the March Finance Committee Meeting. The
purpose of the item on the agenda was to bring forward for discussion the question of what information the
Committee wants to see on the dashboard; deferral of the item to the March meeting will allow for a greater
participation of Committee Members in the discussion.

C. Grants - Cook County Department of Public Health
Noreen Lanahan, Director of Financial Control of the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH),
provided information on the grants managed by CCDPH. She stated that CCDPH manages approximately thirtyfive grants; these mainly consist of grants received from the Illinois Department of Public Health, and are often
pass-throughs of Federal grants.
Ms. Lanahan stated that, if a grant renewal is effective July 1st , the funding is not typically in place in the County
system until approximately October; the delay is usually due in part to the State receiving the contract late from
the Federal Government, and the need for the State to process it through their internal system. By October,
CCDPH will have incurred approximately twenty-five to thirty-five percent of the personnel expenses relating to
the provision of the grant-funded services, as the salaries of the personnel would have been paid. By and large,
CCDPH would not have a reason to not apply for or to not accept a grant renewal.
Ms. Lanahan stated that there is a difference between a grant renewal, and knowing that a grant, based on law, is
going to be phased-out. If CCDPH knows that a grant will be phased-out, management will begin phasing-out
that grant in the mid-portion of that grant year.

VI. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Carvalho declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

ICD-10 Situation Analysis

Executive Summary
The ICD-10 Situation Analysis is designed to provide healthcare facilities with the foundational knowledge
needed to begin the transition to ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS. While the current state may be one of
relatively low organizational readiness, the deliverables of the Situation Analysis bring clarity to the path
towards a future state of high organizational readiness, where people, processes, and technology are
prepared, risks are identified, and contingency plans are in place.
The transition to ICD-10 in the United States is largely regarded as the single most complex, widespread,
and expensive mandate to be implemented in history. The transition will in fact affect nearly every aspect
of the industry, including providers, payers, and system vendors, in relation to EHRs, documentation,
claims, reimbursement, data, decision making, reporting, and quality initiatives. As a complex, urban
healthcare organization, Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS) will most assuredly
experience all possible ramifications, thus, it is critical that the planning and execution phases of the
project begin immediately.
Aspects of business operations and business culture that are unique to CCHHS complicate the picture
and may present conflicting priorities. While most healthcare organizations foresee significant impact to
the revenue cycle, the atypical billing and reimbursement models in play at CCHHS could suggest a
smaller impact. Dependence upon this assumption in the long run could lead to diminished
reimbursement or indications of lower severity/quality due to the importance of ICD data from a reporting
standpoint.
The highly electronic nature of patient documentation at CCHHS provides many advantages, among
them, the potential for a more consistent degree of documentation and the opportunity to employ
emerging technology such as computer assisted coding. On a related note, the medical staff is highly
engaged in decision making and implementation of the electronic health record (EHR), which is a
significant advantage from an ICD-10 standpoint.
The technology strategy deployed at CCHHS in which key clinical and financial systems are concentrated
among a relatively small number of systems vendors in some ways simplifies the technology plan for
ICD-10. However, the widespread use of these systems in multiple locations and the dependence on the
systems cannot be underestimated.
The findings of the Situation Analysis are summarized in a series of eleven (11) recommendations in the
Recommendations section on page 11. These recommendations address a wide variety of people,
processes, and technology instrumental to ICD-10 success. More specific findings are highlighted in this
written report and presented in detail within the toolkit on the accompanying CD. A two-year budget in the
amount of approximately $4.8 million is provided with the toolkit as well.

Background
On January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a Final Rule for
the adoption of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code sets to replace the currently used ICD-9-CM code sets
under rules 45 CFR Parts 160 and 162 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA). HHS is adopting ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS as medical data code sets under HIPAA,
replacing ICD-9-CM Volumes 1, 2, and 3, with a single compliance date of October 1, 2013. The
compliance date refers to all claims received for encounters and discharges occurring on or after October
1, 2013.
ICD-10-CM (diagnoses) adoption will affect all components of the healthcare industry. ICD-10-PCS
(procedures) adoption is required only for inpatient procedures. Physicians and those in ambulatory
settings will continue to use Current Procedural Terminology® (CPT®) and Healthcare Common
Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) to bill for their services.
There are three key issues HHS believes necessitates the need to update from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM
and ICD-10-PCS:


ICD-9-CM is out of date and running out of space for new codes.



ICD-10 is the international standard to report and monitor diseases and mortality, making it important
for the US to adopt ICD-10-based classifications for reporting and surveillance.



ICD codes are core elements of many health information technology (HIT) systems, making the
conversion to ICD-10-CM/PCS necessary to fully realize the benefits of HIT adoption.

The uses of the ICD classification system go well beyond the purposes for which ICD-9-CM was
designed, or even contemplated. Historically used primarily in the hospital inpatient setting for indexing
purposes, ICD diagnosis and procedure codes are today used as the basis for reimbursement, as well as
for quality measurement, public health research, clinical and outcomes research, health policy planning,
clinical, financial, and administrative performance measurement, and a myriad of other uses.

Operational Impact of ICD-10
The transition to ICD-10-CM/PCS promises pervasive impact throughout the healthcare industry.
Incorrectly characterized sometimes as a “coding problem” or an “IT project”, the transition will in fact
affect nearly every aspect of the industry:


Providers, payers, and system vendors



Financial and clinical



EHRs, documentation, claims, reimbursement, data, decision making, reporting, and quality initiatives

Success is heavily dependent on a thorough assessment of people, processes, and technology, followed
by complex planning and execution initiatives. The potential impact of ICD-10 to health care providers
and provider organizations includes significant educational programming, multiple system upgrades and
testing cycles, productivity decreases, impacts to cash flow, and, lost, delayed, or reduced
reimbursement. In addition, there is significant dependence on physician documentation. One of the
largest challenges in the transition to ICD-10 is ensuring that documentation meets the level of specificity
and granularity required to achieve optimal reimbursement, meet all reporting requirements, and most
accurately reflect the level of care provided.
The Situation Analysis is designed to assess the organizational readiness in three key areas (people,
processes, and technology) to position CCHHS with the foundational knowledge required to begin the
transition to ICD-10, and finally, to deliver a roadmap and budget. The goal is to transform the present,
perhaps unclear environment, to a future state of organizational readiness.

Project Scope and Approach
CCHHS engaged Siemens to perform an ICD-10 readiness assessment designed to position CCHHS
with the foundational knowledge needed to begin the transition to ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS.

Project Scope
The scope of the Situation Analysis incorporates the three Cook County hospitals (Stroger, Provident,
and Oak Forest), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network, and the CORE Center. Leadership
from all corporate-level and facility-level departments were interviewed, in addition to a variety of
physicians representing the care delivery areas.

Project Approach
The following blueprint is a best practice that is designed to centralize all pertinent information related to
the management of complex programs such as transitioning from ICD-9 to ICD-10. The Blueprint divides
the program into three phases – Situation Analysis, Planning, and Execution and Monitoring. Within each
phase, the program focuses on four categories of analysis and work - People, Processes, Technology,
and Planning. Each item on the Blueprint is an independent activity designed to collect data, present
findings, and highlight important information. The Situation Analysis activities are summarized in this
document.

Recommendations
A considerable amount of data and information has been gathered as part of this Situation Analysis and
documented in the tools and reports provided. Moving into the planning and execution stages, the
contents of the tools and reports should be used to develop project plans, refine contingency planning,
schedule upgrades and education, and prepare the organization for October 1, 2013.
The following key recommendations, derived from this Situation Analysis, should form all activity for the
next two years. All of these recommendations are incorporated in more detail into the tools and reports
provided.
1. Immediately assemble governance and program management structures that expedite progression to
the planning and execution phases of the ICD-10 program.
a. The ICD-10 Blueprint (Appendix B) and Program Governance Diagram (Appendix C) will illustrate
these concepts.
2. Implement a multi-disciplinary clinical documentation improvement (CDI) program designed to:
a. Improve the specificity and granularity required to achieve optimal reimbursement
b. Address reporting requirements
c.
Note.

Most accurately reflect the level of care provided to patients
A multi-disciplinary CDI program is typically composed of physicians, HIM, Case Management,
and Quality Improvement. The effort includes concurrent and post-discharge processes and
operates within established ethical guidelines. Operationally, the department may be part of HIM,
Case Management, Quality Improvement, or it may be a separate department entirely.

3. Schedule a detailed discussion with Cerner about their template transition and terminologies strategy
for Q1 2012.
a. Involve physicians, HIM, informatics, and IT.
b. Specific discussion is recommended around the practical and logistical use at CCHHS of the
“convert dialog” tool and the “diagnosis control” tool.
c.

Review of standard templates utilized in PowerChart and FirstNet from an ICD-10 clinical
documentation perspective in advance of this meeting by an AHIMA-approved ICD-10 trainer is
necessary. This will provide a working knowledge of the content and enable a more detailed and
specific discussion around Cerner’s plans to modify template content for the greater specificity of
documentation required in ICD-10.

4. Align the detailed findings of the ICD-10 assessment with the PWC and McKesson pro-fee projects,
to leverage and maximize both efforts and results. These and all similar projects throughout the next
two years should operate with ICD-10 requirements in the forefront.
5. Plan ahead for anticipated industry staffing shortages and constraints in the following departments:
HIM/Coding, IT, Patient Access, and Patient Accounting.
6. Consider computer assisted coding (CAC) technology to address expected productivity loss. This is
an ideal strategy for CCHHS’ highly electronic environment.
7. Plan for comprehensive education strategies designed to handle large numbers of users (2,800+) and
flexible enough to meet the diverse needs of different user populations (coders, physicians, registrars,
etc.).
a. Evaluate the practicality of using the “eHealthcare IT Platform” for this purpose. Contractual and
technical limitations should be evaluated as well.

8. Plan for supplemental staffing in the HIM/coding area in 2012 and 2013 to address anticipated
productivity loss and to back-fill time spent on education and dual coding initiatives.
a. Dedicate resources in 2012 to assessing the current skills/knowledge of the HIM coding staff in
relation to the more comprehensive and detailed requirements in ICD-10-CM/PCS.
9. Examine impacted workflows identified in the assessment and plan for necessary remediation as part
of the planning and execution phases.
10. Evaluate the interplay between IRIS, medical necessity processes, documentation of care, and billing
for outpatient registrations. Re-engineer as required to streamline and improve data quality.
11. Plan for supplemental staffing in the IT department in 2012 and 2013 to manage required system
upgrades, interface changes, and related work.
a. Follow up on outstanding vendor questionnaires in order to obtain a full picture of the effort.

Budget Summary
The budget for 2012 and 2013 was compiled using a combination of data collected and assumptions
based on industry projections for ICD-10 spending.
1. Technology and External Vendor/Contractor Fees
There are no known systems at risk for non-compliance with the ICD-10 mandate at this time;
pending definitive responses from 24 additional vendors (see the Information Systems Analysis
section on page 22). The budget does allow for the addition of new software/systems for computer
assisted coding (CAC) and clinical documentation improvement (CDI), should CCHHS move forward
with stated recommendations in these areas. This section also includes interface remediation fees,
maintenance fee increases, and professional services related to IT system upgrades. The two-year
total estimate for this category is $1,479,965.
2. ICD-10 Program Office
Critical to the success of this initiative is the establishment of an ICD-10 Program Office, responsible
for project management, direction, oversight of issue resolution, and coordination. The convergence
of system upgrades requires a dedicated strategy for testing. This category includes resources for a
testing office as well. The two-year total estimate for this category is $1,889,550.

3. Education and Training Fees
The education and training fees budget includes early education for in-house experts, coding
leadership, physician and clinician leadership, and data users in 2012. It is critical that these
individuals acquire education in 2012 so that they may contribute more effectively in the planning and
execution phases of the project. In 2013, full end user education is implemented across all
departments and user profiles, as elaborated upon in the Training and Education Analysis. The twoyear total estimate for this category is $359,339.
4. Clinical Documentation Improvement Program Development
A key recommendation made in this Situation Analysis is the creation and development of a multidisciplinary CDI program. The effort includes concurrent and post-discharge processes and operates
within established ethical guidelines. The operational aspects of a CDI program would involve an
estimated staff of three. Operationally, the department may be part of HIM, Case Management,
Quality Improvement or it may be a separate department entirely. This estimate is purposely modest
as compared to many CDI programs in the industry because of the highly electronic nature of
documentation at CCHHS. The extensive use of templates, assuming they are constructed with CDI
principles in mind, should reduce the operational effort in the long term. The two-year total estimate
for this category is $595,059.
5. Supplemental Staffing for Go Live
Supplemental staff is planned in the budget in three areas: Patient Access, Patient Accounting, and
HIM coding.
Note.

Contract staffing for the IT staff is included in the Technology and External Vendor/Contractor
Fees (Item #1) above.

In Patient Access and Patient Accounting, modest supplemental staffing is included for Q4-2013, to
back-fill for the learning curve and to process an anticipated increase in denials. For HIM coding, the
supplemental staff is more aggressive. A 10% increase in staffing is figured for Q2 and Q3 2013,
while coders are attending educational sessions and implementing dual coding processes. In Q4
2013, the staffing increase is figured at 50% to account for the significant decrease in productivity
anticipated. Supplemental staffing should be continued into 2014 for a period of three to six months.
The two-year total estimate for this category is $506,609.

Financial Risk Analysis
Healthcare industry experts forecast significant financial risk with the implementation of ICD-10. Cash flow
risks include the introduction of complex payer coverage, medical review edits, complex payer
authorization requirements, increased denials, delayed or lost revenue due to lack of specificity in clinical
documentation, and increased days in accounts receivable due to productivity loss.
The Revenue Impact worksheet in the Budget Estimate spreadsheet offers financial calculations that will
enable CCHHS to begin to develop contingency plans for the potential financial risk associated with
ICD-10.

Risks and Countermeasures
A set of 18 risks and associated countermeasures has been developed for CCHHS, based on the
particular circumstances of its reimbursement, coding, IT infrastructure, and staffing. These are
referenced in detail in the Contingency Inventory tool.
Areas of high risk include software vendor readiness, preparedness of internal stakeholders, funding for
the elements of the ICD-10 project, and clinical documentation workflows in Cerner. Areas of low risk
include those that concern reimbursement models, case mix exposure, and payer readiness.

Detailed Analysis
In this section, each of the tools delivered as part of the ICD-10 assessment project is referenced by
name and described in terms of purpose. The major findings and/or recommendations are then
presented. The reader is encouraged to open and review the detailed contents of the tools themselves in
order to gain maximum information and benefit.

Internal Stakeholders – Readiness and Analysis
Tool:

ICD-10 - Cook County - Internal Stakeholder Analysis.xls

The Internal Stakeholder Analysis identifies the main stakeholders - departments, individuals, and groups
- within CCHHS that will be impacted by ICD-10 and documents red flags and follow ups for the planning
and execution phases. In most cases, the red flags identified in this analysis are also incorporated as
impacts or recommendations in the Workflow Analysis tool (see the Workflow Impacts Analysis section on
page 20). Each stakeholder/department impacted will be required to make a commitment in time, budgets
and resources over the next 12 to 24 months or longer to ensure as smooth a transition as possible to
ICD-10.
The layout of the tool is as follows: Stakeholders are listed in column C. The Profile section provides
contact information plus awareness and impact of ICD-10 to that department or individual. The Follow Up
section includes important red flags identified that should be further evaluated and incorporated into
future project phases, as well as pertinent notes. Major findings are summarized below.

Major Findings
1. Awareness of the impact of ICD-10 and the scope of change is relatively low throughout areas of the
organization that will be significantly impacted, such as Patient Accounting and HIM.
Note.

Since these interviews were performed, new HIM leadership is on-board at CCHHS. Ms. Natasha
Lafeyette-Jones, System Director of HIM, has a strong understanding of the implications of
ICD-10 on HIM and coding.

2. There is extensive use of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes in IRIS, yet codes are not maintained in that
system. Related to this, there is a lack of clarity on current and potential value of IRIS to the revenue
cycle. The free-text format of the “Diagnosis/ICD-9” field is insufficient to capture and report for
revenue cycle purposes.
3. In contract to most healthcare facilities, managed care contracts at CCHHS currently do not involve
reimbursement decisions based on MS-DRGs or ICD codes.
4. HIM Coding staff will require extensive education and skill upgrades in order to effectively utilize
ICD-10-CM/PCS. Currently, there is a lack of confidence in the staff’s ability, the majority of whom are
not credentialed.
5. HIM expressed fundamental concerns with the quality of clinical documentation, physician
training/readiness for ICD-10, and troubles with physicians completing charts in a timely manner.
6. The lack of a multi-disciplinary approach to clinical documentation improvement is a significant
concern. Physician involvement in Cerner template development is a positive attribute, but could be
improved with the input of other points of view such as HIM/Coding, reimbursement, and quality
measurement.
7. C-level leadership is managing conflicting priorities, which may potentially detract attention from the
ICD-10 transition. These include the PWC operational transformation and the McKesson pro-fee
billing implementation project. In addition, the current atypical reimbursement model may be artificially
obscuring the financial significance of ICD-10 to the organization.

8. There are limited training resources available internally. External help and expansion of a learning
management platform are key to ICD-10 success. HIM Coding staff in particular will require extensive
education and skill upgrades in order to effectively operate in the ICD-10-CM/PCS environment.
Currently, there is a lack of confidence in the staff’s ability, the majority of whom are not credentialed.
9. ICD diagnosis codes are incorporated into numerous workflows and initiatives across the majority of
stakeholders. In some cases, the ICD-9-CM codes utilized are not maintained for accuracy.
Heightened awareness of the role of ICD codes is a key priority.

External Stakeholders – Readiness and Analysis
Tool:

ICD-10 - Cook County -External Stakeholder Analysis.xls

The External Stakeholder Analysis identifies the main stakeholders – insurers, vendors and suppliers,
and government and reporting agencies - external to CCHHS whose relationship with CCHHS will be
impacted by ICD-10. Red flags and follow ups for the planning and execution phases are identified and
documented. CCHHS must understand the nature of ICD-10 impact specific to each external stakeholder,
and coordinate modifications to operations and data streams. Each of the external stakeholders will be
required to prepare for ICD-10 and their levels of preparedness, along with their timing, will indirectly
affect CCHHS’ ability to plan for a smooth transition to ICD-10. In some cases, modifications to
accommodate ICD-10-CM/PCS may not emerge until the 2013-2014 timeframe.
The layout of the tool is as follows: Stakeholders are listed in column C. The Profile section provides
contact information plus awareness and impact of ICD-10 to that company or agency. The Follow Up
section includes important red flags identified that should be further evaluated and incorporated into
future project phases, as well as pertinent notes. Major findings are summarized below.

Major Findings
1. Payer contracts and readiness will have little impact on CCHHS because none of the 25 regular
payers currently reimburse on MS-DRGs or ICD codes.
Note.

Renegotiation of existing insurer relationships, including Medicare and Medicaid, or, introduction
of any new managed care contracts must proceed with ICD-10 in mind.

2. Illinois Medicaid has expressed doubts that its systems will be compatible with the HIPAA ICD-10
reporting mandate. The following reference can be found in the Illinois Department of Healthcare and
Family Services Human Services Plan for fiscal years 2010-2012
http://www2.illinois.gov/hfs/agency/documents/hsplan.pdf):
“The system faces major challenges over the next several years in meeting federal requirements
related to the conversion of all hospital billing data to ICD-10 reporting by the federally mandated
implementation date of October 1, 2013. It is unlikely the current MMIS can accommodate that
change and failure to adopt the coding would have catastrophic consequences for the State’s ability
to get federal matching funds.”
3. Seven (7) external reporting agencies were identified as utilizing ICD codes for initial case
identification and/or reporting. For the most part, the databases themselves are managed and
administered externally; however, CCHHS in many cases bears responsibility for data reporting
mechanisms, which will require modifications.
4. Adoption of ICD-10-CM/PCS is not required for non-covered entities such as property and casualty
insurance health plans, workers' compensation programs, disability insurance programs, quality
reporting, and patient assessment data sets. This does not mean such entities will not adopt or use
ICD-10. For many non-covered entities, the benefits of adopting ICD-10 will outweigh the challenges
of implementation.

Training and Education Analysis
Tool:

ICD-10 - Cook County –Education Inventory.xls

A complete detailed education plan has been created as a product of this Situation Analysis. The
Education Plan identifies the numbers of users requiring education, the level of education required, the
timing of when that education should be taken, and the costs of that education.
The education analysis revolves around five profiles developed to represent the typical types of
healthcare workers that will require ICD-10-CM/PCS education. While specific job titles and
responsibilities differ from facility to facility, education needs can be determined by comparing the profile
description to the individual. The five profiles are as follows:

The layout of the tool is as follows:


The ‘Training Roadmap’ tab contains the standard recommendation for timing of education to major
stakeholder groups.



The ‘Education Inventory’ tab lists all individuals identified at CCHHS that will require education in
column D. The Profile section corresponds to the graphic above and categorizes the educational
needs of the individuals. The Education section further elaborates on the content of the education
required. The Training Delivery tab offers suggestions for the delivery methods appropriate to the
profile and content.



The ‘Budget’ tab lists the same group of individuals requiring education in column D. The Education
section lists the content of the education required along with typical industry cost for each content
group. The Expense section calculates the per person and per stakeholder group expense for
education.

 Siemens and e4 Confidential

Major Findings
1. Required educational programming exceeds current capacity and structure. More than 2,800
personnel will require some type of education.
a. The newly installed learning management system in the Compliance Department may be an ideal
platform for delivery of computer-based training modules to most individuals requiring education.
2. An industry estimate of 50 hours of ICD-10-CM/PCS coding training is required for inpatient coding
personnel. Additional training to refresh or expand knowledge in the biomedical sciences will likely be
required.
3. The expansion of Case Management’s responsibilities for medical necessity checking and precertification will require ICD-10-CM/PCS education at least at the intermediate level.
4. Changes required in physician documentation in the medical record to support ICD-10-CM/PCS will
require physician education. This can be incorporated in part into clinical documentation improvement
initiatives, as well as being delivered as part of the learning management system.
5. CCHHS should budget a total of $359,339 for education in budget years 2012 and 2013.

Internal Resource Analysis
Tool:

ICD-10 - Cook County – Resource Plan.xls

The internal resource analysis summarizes the additional staffing patterns required as CCHHS moves
into the planning and execution phases of the ICD-10 project. In some areas, required tasks such as
workflow redesign and testing can be accomplished without additional staff. However, there are several
areas that will require supplemental staffing in order to effectively transition to ICD-10, while maintaining
operations and service levels as desired.

Major Findings
1. 15 departments were identified as part of the resource plan, with varying degrees of impact. As noted
above, some of the resource needs identified can be absorbed within existing staffing.
2. HIM leadership should expect to temporarily increase staffing in the coding area in 2012 and 2013 in
order to accommodate and back-fill the extensive training requirements for coders, allow for dual
coding initiatives, and back-fill for the anticipated productivity loss.
3. IT leadership should expect to temporarily increase staffing to manage system upgrades, testing, and
related changes.
4. An ICD-10 Program Office is recommended to direct, manage, facilitate, and coordinate all ICD-10
transition activities.
5. Modification of custom Cerner templates (25) is incorporated into the resource analysis.

Workflow Impacts Analysis
Tool:

ICD-10 - Cook County – Workflow Inventory.xls

The transition to ICD-10 poses significant impact to major and essential workflows performed
continuously in all provider organizations. These workflows are performed in clinical/patient care areas,
HIM, Patient Access and Patient Accounting, Case Management, diagnostic departments, and clinical
and financial support areas. Evaluation of workflows with redesign and remediation is a top priority for
healthcare facilities in preparation for the ICD-10 transition.

 
Thirteen (13) of the 24 workflows studied as part of the Situation Analysis were categorized as being
highly impacted by ICD-10. These are listed in the table below. These workflows encompass clinical and
financial operations, the most significant of which involves physicians and HIM coders.

 

 

 
Each of the 24 workflows studied and documented on the tool contain an impact analysis and specific
recommendations. CCHHS is encouraged to review each in detail as these will form the basis for a
significant majority of the work to be accomplished in the planning and execution phases.
The layout of the tool is as follows: Major workflows studied are listed in columns C. The rows beneath
each outline the goals of the workflow, current and future relevant process steps, an impact analysis of
ICD-10 to the workflow, and recommendations. Column K categorizes the overall impact of ICD-10 in a
High/Medium/Low range and column L summarizes the impact to that workflow. Major findings are
summarized below.

Major Findings
1. Outpatient registration functions, typically, will be impacted by ICD-10 because registrars enter and
sometimes look up diagnosis codes to complete the registration. This is not the case at CCHHS,
where diagnosis codes are only entered on laboratory and radiology services and only if provided by
the physician on the script.
a. The potential for changing billing processes and reimbursement models will most definitely
require this area to be re-evaluated.

2. Physician documentation workflows are significantly impacted by ICD-10. This fact is made more
complex at CCHHS by the highly electronic documentation practices. Cerner templates, the problem
list, the diagnosis list, and ED admit orders incorporate ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes as an integral part
of the workflow. Multiple terminologies utilized within Cerner complicate these workflows.
3. HIM Coding is completely transformed by ICD-10-CM/PCS. Workflows do not necessarily change;
however, computer assisted coding tools should be evaluated in order to lessen the impact of
productivity loss.
4. Expansion of Case Management's responsibilities, to include both medical necessity and precertification requirements, will require changes in workflow.
5. Because there is no clinical documentation improvement (CDI) program in place at CCHHS, no
workflow is identified in this section.

Precyse-ICD10_Audit-CookCountyProvident-October 2011 REVIEW 111811.xlsx

The true challenge in the transition to ICD-10 from a coding perspective is ensuring that documentation
meets the level of specificity and granularity required to achieve optimal reimbursement, meet all
reporting requirements, and most accurately reflect the level of care provided. To a large extent,
documentation practices will drive success in ICD-10. Some of the largest documentation practices and
changes that will require compliance will be disease specificity, anatomical site and laterality,
complication and manifestations, obstetrics, and correct use of medical terminology and naming.
Precyse Solutions, LLC was sub-contracted to perform an ICD-10 clinical documentation impact audit as
part of the Situation Analysis. A full and comprehensive written report is included with the tools, as well as
a detailed accounting of each of the 97 records reviewed in the audit.

Major Findings
1. 82% of the records audited contained a documentation deficiency.
a. 30% of the records audited contained a documentation deficiency that would affect the principal
diagnosis.
b. 8.2% of the records audited contained a documentation deficiency that would affect an MCC or
CC (major complications and comorbidities/complications and comorbidities).

Forms Analysis
Tool:

ICD-10 - Cook County – Paper Forms Inventory.xls

Part of the typical Situation Analysis includes evaluation and identification of forms utilized by clinical or
financial staff that contain ICD diagnosis or procedures codes. Depending upon the facility, this can be a
significant contributor to workflow. At CCHHS, only one form was identified, the outpatient encounter form
or “superbill”. It should be noted that CCHHS reported the existence of multiple variations of this form
across the different specialty clinics. These were not collected in total.

A comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the ICD-10 transition to information systems was conducted.
This analysis is in three parts: Applications Analysis, Customizations Analysis, and Reports Analysis.

Applications Analysis
Tool:

ICD-10 - Cook County – Applications Analysis.xls

All clinical and financial applications utilized throughout the CCHHS enterprise were identified and
considered for possible involvement in the ICD-10 transition project. The following chart illustrates of the
current status of 100+ applications in the CCHHS inventory. Twelve (12) applications were eliminated
from further investigation due to known inapplicability and CCHHS is awaiting response of the vendor for
an additional 24 applications.

68 responses were received and evaluated for upgrade requirements, interface implications, and fees
and contract implications. 48 (71%) of the applications utilized across the enterprise were determined to
be impacted by ICD-10 and will require an upgrade prior to October 1, 2013.

The associated upgrade timeline provided by the vendors is illustrated below. The large percentage of
applications developed by Cerner and Siemens simplifies the high-level picture to some degree; however,
the complexity and scope of the upgrade steps involved must not be underestimated.

The layout of the tool is as follows:


The ‘Vendor Analysis’ tab contains detailed information about each application surveyed. There are
sections for status of the questionnaire, contact information, ICD-10 strategy, ICD-10 impact, and
contracts and fees. Filters have been placed on this worksheet to facilitate use.



The ‘Application Release Calendar’ tab contains the calendar inserted immediately above this
paragraph.



The ‘Interfaces with DG1 Segment’ tab includes all known HL7 interfaces that contain a DG1
segment. It must be noted that the presence of a DG1 segment does not necessarily mean there are
ICD codes valued in the interface or that if included, the codes are actually accepted by the recipient
application or database. The PDF file embedded in this tab contains narrative notes from the
interview with Marilyn Williams, Integration Manager.



The ‘Mailing List” tabs contain tracking information on questionnaires sent to vendors.

Major Findings
1. 47 applications across five (5) vendors have been identified as requiring an upgrade for ICD-10
compatibility.
2. There are 24 applications across 16 vendors for which a response has not been received. CCHHS
should follow up on these vendors and secure a response in Q1 2012.
3. ICD-10 compliant upgrades in the HIM service area have already been made available (Q3 2011).
4. Cerner Millennium and Siemens Patient Management platform upgrades will be made available in Q1
2012, providing a sufficient amount of time for testing and implementation.

The purpose of the Customizations Analysis is to list and characterize all major customizations that have
been performed to key information systems and to provide a summary of the impact of ICD-10 on these
customizations. Of the 11 areas identified, five are flagged as high impact. These include customizations
made to both the Cerner and Siemens systems.

Major Findings
1. Analyses of the Siemens adhoc reports and the Siemens Patient Management Pathways were
completed. Written reports of both are included with the Situation Analysis report materials.
2. A service to analyze customizations in the Cerner applications will be made available in mid-2012.
3. Cerner’s “convert dialog” strategy to update existing ICD-9-CM codes in PowerNote appears to rely
too heavily on end users and allows end users to make universal code assignments. There is great
potential for the introduction of inaccuracies to the system.
4. Cerner’s “diagnosis control” methodology for resolving diagnosis terms (fragments) appears to rely
too heavily on end users and may impact system usage and productivity.
5. Accurate assignment of ICD-10 codes requires greater specificity of documentation in areas that do
not currently exist in ICD-9. It is unclear how Cerner plans to manage modifications to template
content for ICD-10.

The purpose of the Reports Analysis is to list and characterize all major standard and adhoc reports that
exist today and provide a summary of the ICD-10 impact on these reports.

Major Findings
1. Siemens, Cerner, and 3M/SoftMed contain libraries of standard reports. In the case of all three
vendors, standard reports will be modified as part of the ICD-10 platform upgrades.
2. Siemens and Cerner contain libraries of adhoc reports. In both cases, modification of these reports is
the responsibility of CCCHHS.

Conclusion
In conclusion, there is now a clear picture of the current state of ICD-10 readiness at CCHHS and a
detailed set of tools and materials that will enable CCHHS to embark on the planning and execution
phases of the ICD-10 transition. It is Siemens’ recommendation to institute the ICD-10 Program Office
immediately in the first quarter of 2012 in order to best position the organization for comprehensive
success at the time of the October 1, 2013 compliance date.

When developing the training strategy for PC

can help train users and improve their comfort level.
One option is to create pre-completed patient intake

might need to be considered during the learning curve.

the patient’s MRN to access the patient’s chart.
2) When Quick Registration complete is complete, labels are printed and the patient’s name and status then
appears on the Cerner Tracking Board.
3) Sorting cards are used to separate patients by level of urgency and services needed. There are 5 types of
cards to route the patient to additional vitals, EKG testing, Pediatric route, critical bay or X-ray.
4) Lab and Radiology results are documented and results returned in Cerner.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities and financial activities for the month ended December 31, 2011.
This discussion focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities
during the current month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide primary,
intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to
pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy
activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the month with overall revenue
of $73,765 and overall expenses was $68,578.
Net Patient revenue for the month was $48,466.
5
Page 137 of 173

 Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $371. Other revenue consists primarily of parking and cafeteria
revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2011, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
December-2011 increased by 17 days of revenue (or 11.0%). There were 154 days of
revenue (charges) outstanding at November 30, 2011 and 171 days outstanding at the end
of December-2011. Part of the increase in the number is due to the fact that the internal
bill hold on Out-Patient accounts was reduced to 6 days.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Providing the collection agencies the necessary time to perform their collection
services; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of December-2011 decreased
by $5.148M (24.3%) as compared the November 30, 2011 balance.
The decrease in this figure indicates more discharged patient accounts were moved to a
“Billed” status, as compared to November 30, 2011. The change in this figure does not
translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a
per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the
patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result in
actual cash collections.
6
Page 138 of 173

 Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of December-2011 increased by $22.458M (or
11.6%). This increase also increased CCHHS’ days in revenue outstanding.
The increase in this number indicates more accounts are waiting for the collection
process to conclude. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad debt
write-offs. $5.148M of this increase was due to the decrease in Discharged Not Final
Billed.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
As of the end of December-2011, $8.565M (3.5%) In-Patient accounts in the BEPA
System were over 365 days old.
$3.090M In-Patient accounts were written-off to charity care during December-2012.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $0.037M (0.2%) by the end of
December-2011, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2011.
The change in this figure indicates fewer bills patient bills were moved to a “Billed”
status, as compared to November 30, 2011.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of December-2011 rose by $10.922M
(6.8%) over the balance as of November 30, 2011.
The growth in this figure indicates a greater number of Out-Patient accounts were moved
to a “Billed” status and a reduced number of Out-Patient accounts had collection and
write-off related activities as compared to November 30, 2011. Part of this increase is
due to the fact that the internal bill hold on Out-Patient accounts was reduced to 6 days.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
As of the end of December-2011, $5.803M (3.0%) of the Out-Patient accounts in the
BEPA System were over 365 days old.
7
Page 139 of 173

 $15.885M Out-Patient accounts were written-off to charity care during December-2011.

Operating Expenses at the end of the month was $68.578M broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $41.574M
Benefits - $11.086M
Supplies - $2.708M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $5.964M
Depreciation - $2.787M
Insurance - $4.460M
Nonoperating Revenue was $24.928M. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $11.539M and property tax in the amount of $6.834M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are
comprised of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.
