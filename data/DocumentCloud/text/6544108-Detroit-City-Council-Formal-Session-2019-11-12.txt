HRD has resolved many of the findings associated with the Audit Report. To
address the remaining findings, the OIG requires that certain funds be
transferred to the NSP-1 program and spent on NSP-1 eligible uses. HRD has
worked the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department
(BSEED) and with the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) to credit
the proper funds to the NSP-1 account from both FIE and the General Fund.
In addition, there is outstanding program income in the NSP-1 bank account
that must be appropriated and spent for closeout of the program as required
by HUD.)
