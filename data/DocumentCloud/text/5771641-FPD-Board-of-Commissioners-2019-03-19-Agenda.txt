Summary:
Historically, hay farming has taken place on land owned by the Forest Preserves. This
practice allows the Forest Preserves to generate revenue, while simultaneously preventing invasive plant
species from taking over fallow land. It is the Forest Preserves’ intention to restore fallow land wherever
possible and these farming practices are a good method to retain manageable conditions until a restoration
project can take place, on the site. The contract term for hay cutting is a period of one (1) year, with three
(3) one-year renewal options, which gives the Forest Preserves the option to discontinue farming practices
in order to restore these lands to a natural condition.

Straughn Farm, Inc. was the sole bidder and responsible bidder for the two (2) locations listed below for a
total potential revenue generation over the next four (4) years of $760.00.
