RESOLUTION REGARDING THE SUPPORT OF THE 7% EXPANDED
HOMEOWNER EXEMPTION (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by John P. Daley and Larry Suffredin, County

Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman, Gregg Goslin, Carl R. Hansen, Roberto
Maldonado, Joseph Mario Moreno, Anthony J. Peraica, Mike Quigley, Deborah
Sims and Bobbie L. Steele, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, homeowners in Cook County are overburdened by the
overwhelming increases in property value, as evidenced most particularly in
the last three triennial reassessments; and
WHEREAS, due to the ever-increasing property tax burden, many long time
residents are unable to remain in the prospering neighborhoods they helped to
create; and
WHEREAS, the triennial reassessment cycle makes it difficult for Cook County
homeowners to predict and financially prepare for the impact of three years
worth of property value increases in each reassessment period; and
WHEREAS, many residents in gentrifying neighborhoods are so burdened by
property taxes that they are forced to lobby against neighborhood
improvements, fearing the subsequent increases in their tax bills; and
WHEREAS, increases in the median income of Cook County residents has not
kept pace with the dramatic increases in property values; and
WHEREAS, the overall burden of property taxes has steadily been shifting
more and more onto owners of residential properties; and

wholeheartedly support the continuation of the 7% Expanded Homeowner
Exemption and encourages the state to act swiftly to renew this important
property tax reform ; and

this Resolution to the Governor of the State of Illinois, the President of the
