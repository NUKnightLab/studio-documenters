Discussion/Information Items
A. Strategic Planning: Retreat Session (continued)
William T. Foley, System Chief Executive Officer, provided a brief outline of the expectations
for the day’s meeting. He stated that this is a very important juncture in the strategic planning
process, which began in May of this year. John Abendshien and his team from Integrated
Clinical Solutions, Inc. have been working hard with System staff to assemble the information
and data needed to lay out the parameters of a plan to evaluate and focus upon at this meeting.
In addition to information and data, input from stakeholders has been received. He noted that a
great amount of input has been received from the various constituency groups from within the
System and County; this input was received through responses to questionnaires, meetings with
small groups and testimony at public town hall meetings.
Mr. Foley stated that at this meeting, Mr. Abendshien and his team will lay out the framework,
vision, core goals, and strategic initiatives. In some cases, there are alternatives that should be
discussed at this meeting, so that the Board can come out of the meeting with a basis for a plan.
Over the next month, the draft plan can be taken to the various constituency groups to receive
input. During that time, the three-year strategic financial plan that will support the strategic
plan will be developed, and will be brought to the Board with the final plan for approval.
Mr. Abendshien began the presentation (Attachment #1).
Chairman Batts noted that on page 15 of the presentation, listed as a future goal is for the
System to be in the top 50% nationally in patient and caregiver satisfaction levels. He
questioned whether their expectations should be higher. Director Zopp suggested that they
instead use the term “top quartile”.
Director Zopp inquired regarding the section of the language in the draft vision which refers to
improving the health of the residents of Cook County. She asked whether it was implicit in that
statement that the System will not provide health care to non-residents. Mr. Abendshien
responded that providing health care to Cook County residents would be the focus; it would not
necessarily restrict the System from providing health care to non-Cook County residents.
The Board continued the discussion on the question of providing care to non-Cook County
residents. Director Lyne stated that this is an issue that should be decided. Batts stated that he
believed the new patient policies address this issue; non-Cook County residents must pay for
these services under the new policies, or services (with the exception of emergency care) will
not be provided. In response to Director Greenspan’s inquiry regarding the scale of the issue,
Michael Koetting stated that although the System does not verify the addresses given,
approximately 3-5% of the System’s patients are non-Cook County residents.

Discussion/Information Items
A. Strategic Planning: Retreat Session (continued)
Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer, provided information as it related to a similar
debate during his tenure at the Grady Health System. He offered to draft a narrative of how the
topic was addressed at Grady.
Extensive discussion took place on the subject of community hub centers. Mr. Foley stated that
a possible suggestion is to have both short-term and long-term plans. In the short-term plan,
there could be two or three hubs developed over the next eighteen months. Long-term plans
could move towards four to five hubs. In response to a question regarding existing primary
care/clinic sites, Mr. Foley stated that he would reach out to the existing federally-qualified
health centers (FQHCs), and partner with them on primary care. Director Muñoz stated that it
would be wise to look at what type of staffing would be needed for these hubs; there may be
shortages in specialties in some localities.
In response to a question from Director Muñoz regarding whether clinics would be feeding into
these hubs, Mr. Foley stated that he believes the concept of the whole ACHN network should be
reviewed. If the System is going to really focus its resources on the County’s needs, can
something instead be done to partner with existing primary care clinics, such as the FQHCs?
Chairman Batts polled the Directors on the question of whether this strategic approach should
be fleshed-out so that the Board can make a more rational decision. There was unanimous
agreement on the question. Director Zopp requested that, as the approach is fleshed-out,
information be provided on how this approach impacts what the System is currently doing.
The Board continued to review and discuss the information presented.
The presentation continued to the subject of obstetric services. Mr. Abendshien stated that the
Board could go one of two ways: 1) the System could say that they are out of this business, and
have the service transfer to other providers; or 2) the System could ramp-up their services to
reach a threshold consistent with good operating efficiency and effectiveness (somewhere in the
3000+ delivery range).
The Board discussed the information presented on the provision of obstetric services. Director
Carvalho inquired whether Certificate of Need (CON) requirements have been reviewed.
Directors O’Donnell and Golden requested more information on the subject. Director Ansell
suggested that a two- or three-year strategy be developed; he cautioned against making a quick
decision, stating that if the System gets out of that business it will never get it back. With
regard to Provident Hospital, Mr. Foley stated that the numbers are so low, he thinks they
should stop deliveries there. But from a reimbursement perspective, and being mindful of the
System’s mission, he stated that he would like to focus on the OB/Gyne at Stroger Hospital. He
added that the System should be looking at strategies and relationships like the one with
Northwestern, to improve the services.

Discussion/Information Items
A. Strategic Planning: Retreat Session (continued)
Sidney Thomas, Chief Operating Officer of Provident Hospital of Cook County, provided
examples of past activities and initiatives to increase the number of deliveries at Provident
Hospital.
The Board discussed the options relating to the provision of pediatric and perinatal services. It
was agreed that there should be further exploration of the idea of collaborating and possibly
consolidating these services with other institutions such as Rush Medical Center and UIC
Hospital.
Mr. Abendshien continued the presentation, and Mr. Foley reviewed management’s
recommendations. Specifically discussed were the recommendations regarding the ACHN
clinic network, Fantus Clinic and the provision of long-term care services at Oak Forest
Hospital.
The Board discussed the proposed strategy of 1) focusing on Oak Forest Hospital as a
community hub; 2) building on rehabilitation and phasing-out acute inpatient services; and 3)
examining further long-term care/skilled nursing care at Oak Forest Hospital.
Harold
Emahiser, of Integrated Clinical Solutions, Inc., provided information relating to the decision in
2007 to significantly reduce the long-term care services at Oak Forest Hospital by outsourcing
those services, due to the higher cost of providing them on-site. Sylvia Edwards, Chief
Operating Officer of Oak Forest Hospital, provided information on the average daily census and
the total number of employees at Oak Forest Hospital in 2007.
Mr. Emahiser provided a status update on the process of the three-year financial plan.
Chairman Batts requested that the information reflect the breakdown of payer mix. Mr. Foley
responded that this can be shown on another schedule.
Mr. Foley reviewed the next steps that are planned. Beginning October 8th, there will be
meetings with the County Board President and Commissioners in small groups to review the
framework of the plan and to get some additional input. Beginning in the week of October 19th,
there will be a second series of town hall meetings to receive input on the draft plan. They will
also be meeting with the various constituency groups; these groups include staff, physicians,
labor, community groups, and representatives from the FQHCs. The expectation is to bring the
plan back to the Board for their November 5th meeting.

 Evaluate options for provision of obstetrical and perinatal

services:


Current volumes at both John H. Stroger, Jr. and Provident
Hospitals of Cook County do not meet threshold levels needed
for proficient, cost-effective services, accordingly…



Options should be explored to either (a) significantly expand
delivery volumes (3,000-5,000+ deliveries at one site, ideally in
partnership with other medical entities), or (b) if significant
growth of the service is not attainable or consistent with best
use of County resources, pursue partnership arrangements with
outside p
provider systems
y
for the p
provision of OB services
through service and transfer agreements.



Obstetrical services at Provident Hospital of Cook County
should be discontinued, with deliveries coordinated through
service and transfer agreements.



In any case, CCHHS should continue to provide pre- and postnatal care, and should further build on GYN and women’s
services, including services geared to the needs of the perimenopausal female population.
