Report from Chairman of the Board

Heath Foundation Board to help raise money for the System.
A. Board Education – National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems (NAPH) (Attachment
#4)
Dr. Bruce Siegel, President and Chief Executive Officer of NAPH, provided an overview of NAPH and the
members it serves. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Chairman Batts noted that the Cook County Commissioners should receive a copy of this presentation for
their information; he indicated that the data provided on payer mix was particularly informative.
Dr. Siegel noted that Director Butler was to be honored at a NAPH event last year in Chicago; however,
Director Butler had not been able to attend that event. As a result, Dr. Siegel took the opportunity at this
meeting to recognize and thank Director Butler for his years of service and dedication. He noted that Director
Butler has been a champion, both in this community as well as across the nation, for ensuring that people
have access to the best health care, regardless of who they are, or based on their ability to pay. He stated that
Director Butler has been an advocate for eliminating health care disparities, and his leadership and vision has
become a model for the NAPH.

Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #5)
Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, provided an update on the following subjects: Nurses Week; Recognition
– Internal Medicine Resident Team; Recognition – Emergency Medicine Physician Assistant Residency Program;
Recognition - Blood Bank Anniversary; Recognition – Patient Thank-you Letters; and Transition of Chief
Information Officer.
Dr. Raju noted that Dan Howard, Chief Information Officer, is moving on from the organization; he thanked Mr.
Howard for his dedication and service to the System. He stated that, during Mr. Howard’s time with the System,
he led the entire transformation of the System’s information technology system, has been the lead on some very
valuable projects and has developed a very strong team under his leadership.
Mr. Howard presented a transition report and update on Information Systems (Attachment #6). Included in the
report was the following information: Information Technology Organization; Help Desk Service Center; Power
Chart 2012; Accomplishments; and Next Steps.
Chairman Batts thanked Mr. Howard for his service, and expressed the Board’s appreciation of Mr. Howard’s
accomplishments on behalf of the System.
On a separate subject, Director Carvalho stated that, in the last week, the Legislature has passed four (4) very
significant bills that will affect the System; he requested that the subject be reviewed and discussed with the
Finance Committee. Dr. Raju responded affirmatively, and provided additional information. He stated that the
first hurdle was cleared at the State with regard to the Section 1115 Waiver. With regard to the charity care
debate, Dr. Raju indicated that the status quo will continue; the Medicaid gap between the cost versus
reimbursement will be counted towards charity care, including community benefits. Director Carvalho stated that
he is most concerned about the bill regarding the cut to the Medicaid program that will eliminate eligibility for
100,000 people. He noted that this translates to 100,000 uninsured people; if seventy-five percent (75%) of those
uninsured people live in Cook County, and there’s no additional obligation on other hospitals to do charity care,
there could be a significant impact to the System. Dr. Raju agreed; he stated that he will provide further
information for the Finance Committee to review and discuss on the subject.

6
Draft Amendment May 2012Amended September 5, 2008

Page 15 of 49

 employment purposes or the business of the public body; or (iii) a family or other

Secretary before the meeting unless advance notice is impractical.

generally perform the duties customarily performed by a presiding officer. In the absence of the
Chair, or during the temporary inability of the Chair to act, the Vice-Chair shall preside at

meeting, the System Board shall appoint a Director to preside at that meeting. In the absence of
a Committee Chair, or during the temporary inability of the Committee Chair to act, the
Directors of that Committee shall appoint a Director who is a member of that committee to
preside at that meeting.
(c) Quorum. A majority of the Directors shall constitute a quorum for a meeting of the System

quorum for a meeting of such committee or subcommittee. Directors in attendance at a meeting
of a committee or subcommittee who are appointed to serve as substitute members of that
committee or subcommittee pursuant to Section 4 (c)(5) of these Rules shall be considered in
determining whether a quorum is present.
(d) Majority votes. Actions of the System Board shall require the affirmative vote of a majority
of the Directors present and voting at the meeting at which action is taken. Actions of a
committee or subcommittee of the System Board shall require the affirmative vote of a majority
of the Directors present and entitled to vote at the meeting at which action is taken. A vote of
"present" shall not be counted in determining the number of Directors voting on a question.
(e) Absence of quorum. Should a quorum not be present at any meeting of the System Board or at
any committee or subcommittee meeting, the meeting shall not thereby stand adjourned, but the
Directors present shall be competent to adjourn, receive information or public testimony but take
no formal action, or recess the meeting to a specified date and time by a majority vote of those

Doctor’s  Dilemma  is  a  “Jeopardy”  style  competition  where  physicians  in  training  are  asked  a  series  of 
medical  trivia  questions.    The  Cook  County  Internal  Medicine  Resident  Team  won  first  place  at  the 
American College of Physicians Northern Illinois Chapter Associate’s Day Doctor’s Dilemma competition 
held this past fall 2011.  The team was awarded the opportunity to compete at the American College of 
Physicians  national  competition  at  Internal  Medicine  Week  in  April  2012.    The  team  members  are 
Chijoke Onyenwenyi, Gurpreet Singh and Arvind Rangarajan.  Many of the Internal Medicine Residents

service to the people of Cook County.  The EM PA residency is finishing up its first full year in June 2012.  
Our  current  class  of  residents  are  Carrie  Kraeger  (Wake  Forest)  and  John  Paul  Magenis  (SUNY

 for the Stroger Hospital Blood Bank for his efforts in organizing the symposium and the publishing of the 
journal supplement. 
 
Patient Thank You Letters 
I  would  like  to  acknowledge  two  employees  that  have  been  recognized  by  their  supervisors  for 
exemplifying delivering the best patient care: 
Pharmacist Pete Ananopolis – Stroger Hospital 
“He  came  to  my  room  to make  sure  I  was  educated  sufficiently  on  the  use of  my  medication: 
How  is  that  your  sugars  are  being  contained  with  regular  insulin  at  low  doses?  Are  you  doing 
something at home that required so much concentrated insulin?  He then asked me how well I 
understood  why  I  need  the  concentrated  insulin  and  then  he  further  educated  me  on  the 
medication.  This was life saving information for me.” 
Nurse Mary Watson, RN – CCDPH 
“She  assisted  me  in  my  recent  request  to  enroll  in  the  Illinois  Breast  and  Cervical  Cancer 
Program.    She  did  her  best  to  reassure  me,  and  ensure  I  received  excellent,  timely  care,  and 
proper procedures.  I believe that she is definitely an asset to this program.” 
Both Pete and Mary’s supervisors received letters from patients extolling the virtues of these employees 
and the great care they received.  I thank Pete and Mary for the example they have set. 
 
TRANSITION OF CIO 
As you know Dan Howard, our System Chief Information Officer has submitted his letter of resignation 
and  his  last  day  is  today,  May  31st.    I  want  to  thank  Dan  for  his  many  years  of  service  to  the  Health 
System, as a contractor and as our Chief Information Officer.  He leaves behind a strong team led by Dr. 
Bala Hota, Acting Chief Medical Information Officer and consisting of the following: 
Donna Hart – Chief IT Operations 
Marlon Burns ‐ Chief Technology Officer 
Marty Grant ‐ Clinical Team Manager  
Joe Zima – Network Manager  
Scott Ellis – Chief Security Officer
