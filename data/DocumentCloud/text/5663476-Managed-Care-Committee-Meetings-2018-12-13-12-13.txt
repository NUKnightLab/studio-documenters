Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
During the review of the information provided on slide 4 of the presentation, Board Chair Hammock
requested that, after the open enrollment period ends, Mr. Kiamos should inform the Committee by
highlighting the changes for CountyCare’s competitors for the period before and after the open enrollment
period. Mr. Kiamos responded that this information will be provided.
During the discussion of the information on FFS and MCO enrollment in Cook County (slide 11 of the
presentation), the Committee discussed the subject of the decrease of 92,000 Medicaid enrollees in Cook
County that occurred in July 2018. Mr. Kiamos stated that the biggest driver attributable to the decrease is
the State’s policy relating to redetermination. It was noted that several advocacy groups are working to
resolve problems on redetermination. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, noted that Cook
County Health’s administration recently briefed Director Munar on the subject, as he is one (1) of the three
(3) co-chairs for Governor-Elect J.B. Pritzker’s health-related transition committee.
During the discussion of the information on slide 15 of the presentation, regarding total spend at the top ten
(10) hospitals, Director Prendergast inquired whether staff can drill down in terms of specialty care. Mr.
Kiamos responded that he can provide this information.
