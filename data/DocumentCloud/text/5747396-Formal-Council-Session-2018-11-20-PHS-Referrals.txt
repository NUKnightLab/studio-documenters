Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 1821 Giffels Webster, request to vacate a series of public alleys
and street rights-of?way within and adjacent to Woodward, Monroe,
Randolph, Farmer, Bates and Cadillac Square in the City of Detroit,
Michigan.

Background:

Petition 1821 requests changes to public rights-of-way to prepare for the redevelopment of
the Monroe Block site (bounded by Cadillac Square, Woodward Avenue, Monroe Avenue,
Farmer Street and Bates Street), also to prepare for redeveIOpment the Bates Block site
(bounded by Randolph Street, Monroe Avenue, Farmer Street and Bates Street). The
Downtown Detroit Development Authority (DDA) and Rosko Development Company
LLC (?Bedrock?) have or are entering into a Development Agreement to facilitate this
important major new development. Certain changes to the rights-of-way are necessary to
?nalize the preparation of the Monroe and Bates Blocks for the development and allow for
clear title to the land to be transferred for the project}

The City of Detroit owns all public rights-of?way in the unique area of Detroit platted in
the ?Governor and Judges?. Therefore, the City will deed the title to the vacated rights-of-
way to the DDA to then be transferred to the developer. Certain easements will be required
and these easements shall also be transferred in the same manner. The easements aim to
protect certain public and utility interests while also minimizing the impact on the ability
to develop the land. The developer along with their project engineers have been meeting
with all potentially involved agencies and utility companies to assure that satisfactory
arrangements have been made regarding utility placement, abandonment or relocation.

City Engineering Division DPW notes there have been previous resolutions in the area
including: 1) The vacation of Library Street in a resolution recorded December14, 1953 in
Liber 11949, Page 276; also 2) The vacation of alleys in the ?Monroe Block? recorded
February 20, 2002 in Liber 35633, Page 65. The intention with the current resolution is to
replace and supersede the previously granted resolutions.

Petition No. 1821
Giffels Webster on behalf of Bedrock request for the following vacations and granting of
easements:

A) Vacation of rights-otiwav: (as more particularly described in the following
resolution)

 

1) Library Street, 60 feet wide, from Monroe Avenue, 120 feet wide, to Randolph
Street, 86 feet wide.

2) Farmer Street, 60 feet wide, from Monroe Avenue, 120 feet wide, to Bates Street,
60 feet wide.

3) Easterly 10 feet of Monroe Avenue, 120 feet wide, from Cadillac Square, 200 feet
wide to Randolph Street, 86 feet wide.
