he was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the BOHD, against expenses (including
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably

reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or

faith in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of
the BOHD or the CCPHS, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any such action, suit or
proceeding referred to in this subsection or in defense of any claim, issue or matter
therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorney's fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.

(2)

Any such indemnification shall be made by the BOHD only as authorized in the
specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the Director, officer,
employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable
standard of conduct. Such determination shall be made:
(a)

By the BOHD by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who
are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding,

(b)

If such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of
disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written
opinion.

(3)

Reasonable expenses incurred in defending an action, suit or proceeding shall be paid
by the BOHD in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, as
authorized by the BOHD in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the Director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount, unless it
shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the BOHD as
authorized in this Section.

(4)

Any Director, officer, employee or agent against whom any action, suit or proceeding
is brought may employ his or her own attorney to appear on his or her behalf.

(5)

The right to indemnification accorded by this Section shall not limit any other right to
indemnification to which the Director, officer, employee or agent may be entitled.

administrators of any Director, officer, employee or agent of the BOHD.

liability under the provisions of this Section.

information prior to bid opening but failed to do so shall not be entitled to protest a bid on the basis of
insufficient information or clarity after the bids have been opened.

COMMISSIONERS
PRESENTATION
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 25, 2008 from
MIKE QUIGLEY, County Commissioner
This request formally invites the Assessor’s Office to give a presentation highlighting the newest website
features available on the Assessor’s website. We appreciate all of the efforts the Assessor’s office has
made to comply with the amended Cook County Ethics Ordinance. The amendments to the Ethics
Ordinance sought to bring a greater level of transparency to the property tax appeal process, and the
changes made to the Assessor’s website have facilitated this goal of increased transparency. The recent
advancements to the Assessor’s website, making all property tax appeals data available and easily
accessible to the public, demonstrate the office’s willingness to go above and beyond our expectations of
transparency and equality in the tax appeal process.
In an effort to share the Assessor’s latest achievement with all Cook County Board members, county
employees, the press, and anyone who might utilize this new feature, we hope they will be available to
present the new website features at a Cook County Board meeting.
_________________________
Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the Communication be referred to

WHEREAS, the spread of Tuberculosis continues to present a global public health threat. Second only to

difficult to treat; and

requesting authorization to negotiate and authorize the Purchasing Agent to enter into a professional

Following extensive review by the Bureau’s Evaluation Committee, ACS HCS was selected
by the Bureau because of ACS HCS’ depth of experience in performing revenue cycle
services, Best Practice knowledge and their understanding of the Bureau operations. ACS
HCS would provide revenue cycle services to the Bureau which will include but not be
limited to an assessment and analysis of the Bureau’s revenue cycle process for inpatient and
