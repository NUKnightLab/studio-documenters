Item No. 5

AUTHORIZATION TO PROCEED WITH THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES
UNDER PHASE 1 OF THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE DEMONSTRATION (RAD) PROGRAM FOR
APPROXIMATELY 13 PROPERTIES AS NECESSARY OR REQUIRED.
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (Board) approve the attached Resolution
authorizing CHA staff to proceed with the application process for an additional 13 properties under
Phase 1 of CHA’s RAD portfolio application to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD). These additional properties serve, in part, as a contingency plan for original Phase 1 properties
that may not move forward in accordance with Phase 1 programmatic deadlines.
The Office of the Chief Housing Officer, the Asset Management Department, and the Office of the
General Counsel support the submission of this resolution and recommend the approval of this item
accordingly.
CORPORATE GOAL
The transition to RAD and the approval to proceed with applications for additional properties supports
all three of the primary Plan Forward goals:
Plan Forward Goal #1: Reimagine the final phase of the Plan for Transformation coordinating public and
private investments to develop healthy, vibrant communities.
Plan Forward Goal #2: Ensure that CHA’s housing portfolio is safe, decent and sustainable.
Plan Forward Goal #3: Expand services to more residents, targeted to their needs, and at critical
milestones in their lives.
As the largest RAD applicant in the country, CHA is taking the necessary precautions to position the
agency as a strong implementer of this important preservation program.
FUNDING: No additional funding required. Authorization request is only to submit individual property
applications and as necessary, process substitutions with HUD.
GENERAL BACKGROUND
In 2012, Congress authorized the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. RAD provides an
opportunity for housing authorities to utilize either project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental
assistance (PBRA) contracts to stabilize funding for up to 185,000 units1 of public housing. A primary

In December 2014, Congress approved an omnibus bill that included an increase in the RAD
unit cap from 60,000 units to 185,000 units.

 goal of RAD is to use long-term contracts to leverage private financing for capital improvements while
preserving affordability.
CHA submitted a portfolio application to HUD on October 24, 2013 to transition 10,935 units within two
phases under the RAD program. CHA anticipates an award will be issued soon. Once an award is issued,
CHA will be required to achieve certain programmatic milestones within specified deadlines. In the event
there are properties within Phase 1 that cannot meet the deadlines associated with the RAD award, CHA
has identified 13 properties originally reserved for Phase 2 that may move up in queue either as
additional Phase 1 properties or as substitutions.
Below is the list of properties anticipated to be additional Phase 1 RAD transactions or possible
substitutions for Phase 1 properties that do not move forward:
