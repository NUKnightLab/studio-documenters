PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTS RESIGNATION OF SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY METRA DIRECTORS

WHEREAS, the Metropolitan Rail Board or METRA is tasked with running one of the largest metropolitan rail
systems in the country; and

WHEREAS, it is imperative that the METRA Board of Directors have the con?dence of the public they serve to
oversee the Chicago region?s commuter rail service; and

WHEREAS, there are a number of serious problems regarding the board?s mishandling of important issues such
as illicit in?uence and questionable contracts that undermines public con?dence in the organization; and

WHEREAS, a recent preliminary audit conducted by the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) into the Alex
Clifford separation agreement states the ?process was inadequate and not suf?ciently documented? and the

?settlement was not ?nancially prudent?; and

WHEREAS, METRA Board Directors failed to consider Employment Practices Liability insurance on any
potential litigation or settlement, which would have provided coverage if a lawsuit was ?led by Mr. Alex Clifford;
and

WHEREAS, the continued lack of proper oversight by the METRA Board of Directors has cost the taxpayers and
ridership signi?cant dollars and resources; and

WHEREAS, in a letter dated July, 2011 the six (6) county chairmen from the Chicago region committed to
replacing all present METRA Board Directors by June 30, 2012 in order to restore faith within the leadership?s
?body? as a result of the scandal involving the former METRA Chief Executive Of?cer; and

WHEREAS, the public has grown suspicious and skeptical as more allegations surface making it impossible for
the remaining METRA Board Directors to continue in their positions with any public con?dence; and

WHEREAS, at least six (6) METRA Board Directors are needed for quorum to ensure that day to day METRA
operations continue unabated.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby request
letters of resignation of the remaining three existing Cook County METRA Board Directors; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the three existing Cook County METRA Board Directors will continue to
serve at the pleasure of Cook County Suburban Caucus until suitable replacements are selected; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners strongly urges the remaining
METRA Board of Directors to not take any substantive action regarding the hiring of a Chief Executive Of?cer or
appointment of a Board Chairperson until all remaining METRA Board Directors have been replaced and a new
full METRA Board has been seated.

Page 2 of 4

WHEREAS, recent scandals involving Alex Clifford?s separation agreement have rocked the METRA Board and
caused the resignation of the METRA Board Chairman and several Directors; and

WHEREAS, the METRA Board of Directors have a ?duciary duty to our taxpayers to ensure that the ?scal and
operational health of METRA is sustainable; and

WHEREAS, public con?dence in the METRA Board of Directors is at an all-time low and therefore more
accountability measures need to be instituted; and

WHEREAS, 70 ILCS 3615/ 3.01 vests authority in the suburban members of the Cook County Board and the
Cook County Board President to appoint ?ve Directors to the METRA Board; and

WHEREAS, the only criteria that 70 ILCS 3615/ 3 .01 sets forth for the appointment of a Director is that they
reside in suburban Cook County; and

WHEREAS, proper management and oversight by the METRA Board demands basic requirements from an
appointed Director; and

WHEREAS, chief among these requirements should be a threshold age limit, educational level, and
professional background.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the Illinois
General Assembly to codify basic requirements in order for an appointment to serve as Metra Board Director.
