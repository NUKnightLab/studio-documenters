PROPOSAL:

Hamzah Yahya appeals the decision of the Buildings Safety and Engineering
and Environmental Department (SLU2019-00040) which DENIED the
construction of a Major Motor Vehicle Repair Facility with Used Motor Vehicle
Sales Lot in a new 3,200 square foot building in a B4 zone (General Business
District). This case is appealed because the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement, decision,
or determination that is made by an administrative official in the
administration of this Zoning Ordinance, or any decision made by the
Buildings and Safety Engineering Department involving Conditional Uses,
Regulated Uses, or Controlled Uses, or any denial of a site plan by the
Planning and Development Department. Also, there is one (1) legally
established Used Auto Sales Lot within 1,000 feet of the proposed Used Auto
Sales Lot located at 7312-5- Central – 679 feet away, that must be addressed
at an additional hearing if the Board choses grant this request for the use and
reverse the Building Department’s decision. (Sections 61-4-91. Permitted
Dimensional Variances, General Dimensional Standards, 61-4-92. Other

DENIED the establishment of a Major Motor Vehicle Repair Facility with

any decision made by the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department
involving Conditional Uses, Regulated Uses, or Controlled Uses, or any

ADJ EMERSON PARK SUB L55 P45 PLATS, W C R 22/322 110 X 170

PURPOSAL:

Bodywerks, Inc. /Christopher Krasusky appealing to seek relief from
regulations in this zoning ordinance on the basis that the denial of the
application TO establish a Used Auto Dealer, Parts, Wrecking &
Dismantling [Salvage] Use on a 18,687 sq. ft. lot in a 7,307 sq. ft. bldg., has
deprived the applicant of all reasonable use of his or her property in a B4
zone (General Business District). For purposes of this Zoning Ordinance,
a hardship shall be defined as a denial of all reasonable economic use of
the property. Upon a finding that the denial of the application has resulted
in a denial of all reasonable economic use of the property, the City of
Detroit may provide the petitioner with relief from applicable zoning
regulations in a M2 zone (Restricted Industrial District). This case is appealed

DOCKET CONTINUED

because the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals from
and review any order, requirement, decision, or determination that is made
by an administrative official in the administration of this Zoning Ordinance,
or any denial of a site plan by the Planning and Development Department.
Also, any applicant for development may file a Hardship Relief Petition with
the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department which seeks relief from
any regulations in this zoning ordinance on the basis that the denial of the
application has deprived the applicant of all reasonable use of his or her
property and shall forward the application to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
Prior to any public hearing, the Board shall review, through its staff, the
submitted documents with the Law Department as to their completeness
and relevance to the claim that the subject property has been subject to a
denial of all reasonable economic use. Staff is reporting its findings to the
Board regarding the claim that the property has been subject to a denial of
all reasonable economic use; the current Used Auto Sales (Permit#7004
May 5, 1979) is located at 18700 Fitzpatrick in a M2 zone – the use is not
allowed in a M2 zone, Dismantling Use does not have a permit on record
(per BSEED): should the Hardship be granted, a variance for the
Dismantling will need to be considered. (Sections 61-4-71 Appeals of
Administrative Decisions, 61-4-101 Deprivation of Use of Property, 61-4111 Review and Consultation with the Law Department, 61-4-124
Application of the “All Reasonable Economic Use” standard, 61-4-125
Burden of proof, 61-4-126 Findings of the Board of Zoning Appeals Sec.
