Standard (NAAQS) Nonattainment Designation
Mr. Tim Kovach stated that NOACA is required to complete a conformity determination within one
year of nonattainment designation for NAAQS. He noted that the determination must demonstrate
that emissions from NOACA’s transportation plans and programs will not prevent the region from
meeting federal air quality standards and will receive final approval from the United States
Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) on August 3, 2019. Mr. Kovach mentioned that an
interagency consultation (IAC) call with local, state, and federal partners occurred on February 12,
2019. He stated that NOACA is coordinating with Akron Metropolitan Area Transportation Study
(AMATS) and the Erie Regional Planning Commission (ERPC) on the conformity determination.
He noted that based on follow-up discussions, all partners agreed that NOACA could advance
the conformity determination based on existing emissions analyses. Mr. Kovach reviewed the

final documents will be forwarded to ODOT, FHWA, and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) for final approval.
Mr. Collier asked how NAAQS is set. Mr. Kovach stated that under the Clean Air Act, EPA is
required to evaluate six pollutants every five years based on the best available science and noted
that EPA has a group that works on the comprehensive analysis of public health impacts of
pollution and secondary impacts, such as wildlife, crops, and trees. Mr. Kovach stated that a
recommendation is given to the EPA administrator, who sets the new standard. Mr. Collier asked
if the standard is set at the federal level. Mr. Kovach said yes.
A motion was made by Mr. Higgins to recommend the transportation conformity determination to
the Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mayor Hunter. The motion passed by

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

July 5, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Reviews – 1st Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement on
the Board of Director’s September agenda. Specifically, the item proposes that the projects have completed
the Project Planning Review (PPR) process.
The Transportation Subcommittee supports this recommendation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
The first quarter PPR covers roadway, bridge and transit projects sponsored by the City of Solon, Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT) and Laketran.
Detailed information about the projects can be found at:

As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPR is included
on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained from the
public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed projects are
posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA staff
will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR prior to amendment
to the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).

 Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
History/Background: These projects are included in ODOT District 12’s Program.
Title: Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
Sponsor: City of Solon
Estimated Total Cost: $8,107,165
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program
provides funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective
activity designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program
is funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
Proposed Project: The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement
Program (HSIP) funding:
•

CUY SR-43 - 1.98: PID No. 109517 - This project involves reconstruction and widening
of SR-43 (Aurora Road), from 2 lanes to 3 lanes, from the Solar Shopping Center, 0.13
mile east of SR-91 (SOM Center Road) to Liberty Road, in Solon (schematic). The
scope will also include a new water line, storm sewer, a permanent traffic signal at Portz
Parkway, a multipurpose path on the south side of Aurora Road and an on-street bike
lane on the north side with new sidewalks. Right turn lanes will be installed at Clearwater
Court, Portz Parkway and Liberty Road.
The project’s estimated total cost is $8,107,605. The estimated cost of preliminary
engineering preliminary development (PEPD) is $64,974. The estimated cost of
preliminary engineering detailed design (PEDD) is $11,466. The PEPD and PEDD will
be funded by ODOT. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $450,000. The RW will
be funded with local funds ($450,000). The estimated cost of construction (CO) is
$7,091,165. The CO will be funded with HSIP funds ($1,500,000) and local funds
($5,591,165). The estimated cost of construction engineering (CE) is $490,000. The CE
will be locally funded.

Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
• Level 3 of NOACA Freight Network, meaning relatively high truck counts. Design should
consider their turning movements mainly at the shopping center.
• Include high-visibility crosswalks and pedestrian countdown heads with the new signal at
Portz Parkway.
• Include pedestrian crossing for Aurora Road.
Committee Review:
Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory Council (BPAC)
RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Consider providing less width to the vehicular lanes and more width to the bike lane
and/or create a buffer between the bike lane. However, the Safety and Operations
Council cautioned not to reduce the eastbound travel lane as some cyclists may still
choose to use the road rather than the side path.
5-3

 •
•

Consider a shared use path on both sides of the road in lieu of the bike lane (allocate the
5 feet to creating a path,10 feet wide, rather than a path, 5 feet wide and a bike lane, 5
feet wide).
BPAC strongly recommends signing and or centerline striping on the new multi-use path.
Since the existing sidewalk on the south side is being widened to serve as a multi-use
path, BPAC recommends measures that will identify that the facility has changed and
cyclists are permitted on the path.

Transportation Subcommittee:
• No comments; recommended for Planning and Programming Committee review.

NOACA Planning and Programming Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

July 5, 2019

RE:

FY 2021-2024 TIP Development – Recommended Projects for NOACA
Controlled Funds

ACTION REQUESTED
The Planning and Programming Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the
Executive Committee for placement on the Board of Director’s September agenda. Specifically,
the item recommends approval of the projects to be funded with NOACA administered Surface
Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funds and STBG set-asides for Transportation Alternative
Projects (TAP) for the SFY 2021-2024 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
NOACA is developing its Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for State Fiscal Years
(SFY) 2021-2024, which will be in effect from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2024. The TIP will
contain road, bridge, public transit, and other transportation projects scheduled for
implementation within NOACA’s five counties. The TIP will include projects supported by
NOACA administered funds and by other federal funds controlled through ODOT, the Federal
Transit Administration (FTA), or by other governmental agencies.
As previously presented, there are approximately 700 identified projects totaling more than $1
billion needed for implementation through the next 2021-2024 TIP timeframe. However, NOACA
only has an estimated $100 million of available funding. As such, it is extremely important that
projects advanced with NOACA funding in the SFY 2021 - 2024 TIP best represent priorities
contained in the AIM Forward 2040 long-range transportation plan while also aligning with
established State and Federal transportation performance management initiatives.
At the March 2019 Transportation Subcommittee staff presented the methodology to filter and
evaluate projects for NOACA funding. The methodology prioritizes projects that best provide
regional benefit and connectivity, as well as address local needs, which are measured against
criteria that aligns with the goals of the NOACA Going Forward, Together regional strategic plan. In
addition, the projects were evaluated against plan priorities as contained in the NOACA AIM
Forward 2040 long-range transportation plan.
At the April 2019 Planning and Programming Committee meeting staff presented the methodology,
which reflected input received from the Transportation Subcommittee, and received additional
input on the recommended approach for evaluation.
At the June 2019 Transportation Subcommittee staff updated the subcommittee on progress
toward the selection of projects to be funded. Staff presented the draft list of projects proposed for

5 - 13

 further evaluation of NOACA funding. The list delineated the top 25% of preservation projects that
were proposed for further evaluation and funding consideration.
The recommended approach involved filtering the top 25% of all preservation projects, both
NOACA Transportation Asset Management (TAM) plan and sponsor requested projects, by cost
effectiveness, which equates to approximately 170 projects. The 170 projects were then distributed
by each county’s percent share of the region’s vehicle miles travelled (VMT). Each county’s
projects have been evaluated by staff against the recommended regional significance and planning
criteria. Projects have also been evaluated considering geographic equity and whether they are
located in an Environmental Justice, Urban Core, or Disadvantaged Community.
Staff also provided projects that were in the bottom 75% of preservation needs that were not
proposed for further evaluation and funding consideration. The subcommittee was asked to
assess the projects and provide input to determine if any projects not proposed for further
evaluation warranted additional consideration based on regional importance and connectivity.
Staff completed the evaluation of proposed projects against regional significance criteria,
considering the Transportation Subcommittee’s input.
The draft project funding recommendations will be presented to the Planning and Programming
Committee at its July 12, 2019 meeting for recommendation and to the Board of Directors at its
September 13, 2019 meeting for approval.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Upon Board approval, staff will work with project sponsors to finalize project scope, schedule
and budget for incorporation into the draft 2021-2024 TIP, along with non-NOACA funded projects.
The final draft TIP will be presented to the Planning and Programming Committee for
recommendation at its January 17, 2020 meeting and to the Board of Directors at its March 6,
2020 meeting.
Projects recommended for NOACA Administered Funds can be found here.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Planning and Programming Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

July 5, 2019

RE:

Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for
placement on the Board of Director’s September agenda. Specifically, the item proposes the
regional priority of projects to be implemented in SFY2024-2025.
A summary of project applications to the NOACA Air Quality Subcommittee and Transportation
Subcommittee at their respective meetings on June 21, 2019.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program provides funding for transportation
projects and programs that reduce congestion and improve air quality for areas that do not meet
National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, or particular matter.
NOACA expects to receive approximately $30 million for SFY 2024-2025 based on historical
funding allocations.
NOACA announced the solicitation for new projects in April 2019 and applications were due
May 2019. NOACA received 10 applications totaling over $30 million. NOACA staff has
initiated evaluation and scoring of each CMAQ application in accordance with the statewide
program policy project scoring criteria. The criterion, developed by the eight large MPO’s
comprising the statewide program, includes:
1. Project Type (10 points)
2. Cost Effectiveness (15 points)
3. Other Benefits (15 points)
4. Existing Level of Service (15 points)
5. Positive Impact on Level of Service (15 points)
6. Status of Project (10 points)
7. Non-Federal Match Commitments (10 points)
8. Regional Priority (10, 7, 4, 2 points based on top four project priorities)
9. History of Project Delivery (up to -10 points)

5 - 15

 Criteria # 8, Regional Priority, is the only one in which NOACA has the ability to control the
assignment of points. As previously directed by the Committee and Board, these points have
been applied strategically by staff to maximize CMAQ funding to the region.
Based on that approach, staff is recommending that the bonus points be assigned to projects
that provide the greatest, furthest reaching benefits to the region’s air quality and multimodal
transportation system. It would not be effective to assign bonus points to projects that would
already score well, for example bus replacements. In accordance with this approach, our
preliminary analysis demonstrates that bonus points would be assigned to the following four
projects:
10 points – REGIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS
7 points – GCRTA BLUE/GREEN RAIL LINE SHELTER IMPROVEMENTS
4 points – SOM CENTER RD MULTI-PURPOSE FACILITY, WILLOUGHBY
2 points – RICHMOND ROAD MULTI-PURPOSE FACILITY, BEDFORD
Proposed regional priority bonus points have been incorporated into the preliminary draft
evaluation scores for all projects. A summary of the applications received with preliminary draft
evaluation scores is attached to this memo.
Staff presented a summary of project applications to the NOACA Air Quality Subcommittee and
Transportation Subcommittee at their respective meetings on June 21, 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Projects selected for the region will establish the initial CMAQ budgets for SFYs 2024-2025.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Upon Board approval, projects will be submitted to the Statewide CMAQ Program Committee
for evaluation against other statewide projects in October 2019. The Statewide CMAQ Program
Committee will then submit project recommendations to the OARC Executive Directors for final
approval at their November 2019 meeting.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Planning and Programming Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

July 5, 2019

RE:

Transportation Review Advisory Council (TRAC) Project Applications

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending the regional priority of TRAC projects in the NOACA
region.
The Transportation Subcommittee reviewed the projects and recommended regional prioritization at its
last meeting.
BACKGROUND
The TRAC has the responsibility for selecting Major New transportation projects for the Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT). The TRAC announced the solicitation of projects for its 2019
round in May 2019. Five applications from the NOACA region totaling more than $200 million, and
twenty seven applications from the entire state were submitted to the TRAC for projects totaling more
than $900 million in new funding requests. Projects eligible for submittal were projects that have a total
cost greater than $12 million, add transportation capacity or reduce congestion, and are critical to the
mobility, economic development, and quality of life of the citizens of Ohio. All but two of the seven
projects have been presented to NOACA committees and to the Board of Directors during prior funding
rounds.
The TRAC has scheduled the public hearing for Northeast Ohio on August 6, 2019. ODOT has
requested project priorities be submitted to the TRAC Program Manager before July 18, 2019.
Projects are listed below in alphabetic order by sponsor name with a description of the proposed
improvement and TRAC funding request. Applications can also be viewed in their entirety on the TRAC
website at this link: Link

RE:

Facility Planning Area (FPA) Revision Request: Transfer of one (1) parcel from the
Lorain County FPA to the Avon Lake/Lorain County Rural Wastewater District (LORCO)
Phase I FPA in Columbia Township

ACTION REQUESTED
The Planning and Programming Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive
Committee for placement on the Board of Directors’ September 2019 agenda. Specifically, the item will
transfer one (1) parcel (1.0 acre) from the Lorain County FPA to the Avon Lake/LORCO Phase I (Phase I)
FPA in Columbia Township.
This Water Quality Subcommittee supports this recommendation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
LORCO received a request from the property owner of permanent parcel number (PPN) 1200099000009 in
Columbia Township to connect to the LORCO sewer line along Hawke Road (Attachment A). The parcel
currently resides in the Lorain County FPA. In order to connect to LORCO’s sewer line, the parcel must be
transferred to the Phase I FPA (Attachment B). Under the federal Clean Water Act, all sanitary sewer
connections must be within the FPA of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that treat the
wastewater.
Columbia Township is not a member of LORCO. To allow for Columbia Township parcels along Hawke
Road to connect to LORCO’s sewers, an agreement was reached between Lorain County, LORCO, the City
of Avon Lake and Columbia Township in 2016. Under the agreement, upon a written request from a
landowner along Hawke Road to connect to LORCO’s sewer line, all parties agree to give their approval for
the FPA change to transfer the requesting parcel(s) from the Lorain County FPA to the Phase I FPA. The
agreement also reaffirms Lorain County’s sewer planning authority as the Designated Management Agency
(DMA) for the Columbia Township parcels along Hawke Road.
LORCO requested letters of support from the City of Avon Lake, Lorain County and Columbia Township on
April 1, 2019. Despite the agreement between these entities, comment letters are still required to fulfill the
notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan. All affected jurisdictions submitted letters of support
for the FPA modification (attached).

5 - 21

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

 Staff Comments:
Hawke Road is on the boundary between Eaton Township and Columbia Township in
Lorain County. It is also on the divide between the Avon Lake/LORCO Phase I (Phase I)
FPA and Lorain County FPA. Eaton Township is a member of LORCO and within the
Phase I FPA. Columbia Township is not a member of LORCO and within the Lorain
County FPA. LORCO has a sanitary sewer line that runs along Hawke Road and
Brokaw Road. Due to the current FPA boundary, only the properties along Hawke Road
in Eaton Township can connect to LORCO’s sewer. All sanitary sewer connections must
be within the FPA of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that treat the
wastewater.
In 2016, LORCO, Lorain County, City of Avon Lake and Columbia Township signed a
sanitary sewer service agreement for the Columbia Township parcels along Hawke
Road, which would like to connect LORCO’s sewers. The agreement stipulates that if a
property owner along Hawke Road requests in writing to be connected to LORCO’s
sanitary sewers, the affected jurisdictions would all support the proposed FPA
amendment to transfer that parcel(s) from the Lorain County FPA to the Phase I FPA. In
the agreement, Lorain County would remain as the sewer planning Designated
Management Agency (DMA) for all Columbia Township parcels along Hawke Road
regardless of the FPA.
LORCO received a request from the property owner of permanent parcel number (PPN)
1200099000009 to connect their planned home, currently under construction, to
LORCO’s Hawke Road sewer. The landowners included a Columbia Township building
permit application, a photo of the home at the time of the request, and a letter from
Lorain County Public Health that does not object to the connection of this home to
sanitary sewers (attached). The 1.0-acre parcel on which the home resides is within the
sanitary sewer service agreement area between LORCO and the affected jurisdictions.
The current FPA boundary has the parcel within the Lorain County FPA (Attachment A).
LORCO has requested an FPA modification to transfer this parcel from the Lorain
County FPA to the Phase I FPA (Attachment B). No prescription changes are
requested.
Even with the sanitary sewer service agreement between LORCO, City of Avon, Lorain
County and Columbia Township, NOACA’s FPA modification policy still requires LORCO
still must solicit support from the affected jurisdictions to satisfy the notification
requirements in Policy 4-6 of the Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan). All affected
jurisdictions support the FPA boundary modification request.
Staff Disposition:
The staff recommends approval of the requested FPA boundary modification between
the Phase I FPA and the Lorain County FPA. LORCO has an existing sanitary sewer
along Hawke Road and Brokaw Road with the capacity to accept the flow from the
proposed development. The request also satisfies the provisions in the sanitary sewer
service agreement between the affected jurisdictions to provided sewers, upon request,
to the Columbia Township property owners along Hawke Road. Lastly, the request is
supported by all the affected jurisdictions and Lorain County Public Health.
