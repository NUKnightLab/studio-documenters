*Includes all the attending physicians in general medicine, family medicine, and
pediatrics all primary care). Note that residents in the clinics are not included,
and they have a productivity of around 1.5-2 patients per hour. A handful of mid-level
providers are also not included, and they have a productivity of around 2-2.5 patients
per hour. -

-**New primary care providers starting in this clinic in 2008

devastated by 2007 budget cuts, essentially getting provider staf?ng
rebuilt in 2008?2009 

is Child AdvocacyCenter, for children victims of rape or sexual abuse
MSchool based clinic

Key point: We take care of the chronically ill patients, the uninsured (70% of the
patients), and the Medicare population that others are unable to serve. This population
is more complicated, and takes longer to serve than self?selected maternal child
patients or healthy customers.

Second key point: Physicians in our system do most of the clerical work for patients,
and our support staf?ng is about half of what and others have. ACHN has a
support staff ratio of about 1.5-2.5 per FTE provider in the clinics (range is 097-25,
and Fantus GMC, our largest primary care clinic, has a support staff ratio 7 provider
FTE of 0.971). The national norm for staff support 7 provider FTE is around 3-3.5.
Physicians in our system do all the referral work, lab or x-ray tracking, electronic
billing documentation, which are tasks done by support staff for the most part in other
systems.
