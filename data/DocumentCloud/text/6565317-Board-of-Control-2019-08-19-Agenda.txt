to Factory Authorized Dealers for vehicle and equipment repairs, parts and services for the period

Fund
Michael Chambers, Department of Public Works, presented. Dennis Kennedy asked for clarification on the
original time period. Andria Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control, provided a history of the prior
approved time periods and amounts. Lenora Lockett asked if the extension of time period should be for a

D. – Consent Agenda
Dale Miller referred to Item No. BC2019-601 and commented that overall travel expenses have increased
over the past year, rather than decrease, as travel was targeted for budget reductions by the
administration and recommended that a formal process be developed for a 2020 spending plan for travel
where the departments would need to prioritize their travel needs to garner more cost control over travel
expenditures. Dennis Kennedy stated that he would relay that message to the County Executive.
Nan Baker referred to Item No. BC2019-599 and asked what is the amount of the commission received by
the County Commissioners Association of Ohio Service Corporation, in comparison to prior years and
asked if the overall savings justify the cost; and asked if the consumption is expected to remain steady
throughout the term of the agreement, with the expectation of a similar commission to be paid. Dale
Miller asked why this item was listed under the Consent Agenda section rather than under New Items for
Review section, as he viewed this energy participation agreement as an item of special significance. Andria
Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control stated that it was her initial intent to list this item under New
Items for Review, but consulted with the Law Department, who recommended this item be placed under
the Consent Agenda. Mr. Miller advised Ms. Richardson that she does have discretion as to where items
are placed on the agenda, as there are no set legal rules for placement of items on the agenda.

14

 There were no further questions. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve items BC2019-599 through – 602;
Dale Miller seconded, the consent items were unanimously approved.

Title:
OPD 2019 Cuyahoga County Reverse Auction Rules – Alternative Procurement – Agenda Item for
Consideration
Scope of Work Summary
Prior Board Approval Number or Resolution Number – BC2018-429 (7/2/2018)
As part of an effort to reduce costs, Cuyahoga County is establishing rules for a reverse auction process
– in accordance with O.R.C. 9.314. These rules will cover the period of time: 9-1-19 through 12-31-20
(Any reverse auction procurements advertised prior to the end of this period are authorized through to
completion). On July 2, 2018, the Board of Control approved BC2018-429 which approved an alternate
procurement process to establish rules and procedures for reverse auction procurements for the period
7/2/2018 – 7/31/2018 in accordance with ORC 9.314. It was originally anticipated that both phases for
the ERP Procurement System would be completed. With a completed and functioning ERP System, OPD
would have the opportunity to assess and develop a long-term reverse auction policy and procedures
for Cuyahoga County by August of 2019. For various reasons, the ERP Procurement phases have been
delayed. As such, OPD has not had the opportunity to assess and develop a long-term reverse auction
policy and procedure that incorporates and maximizes the benefits and features of the ERP
Procurement System. As such, OPD is requesting approval of another alternate procurement for
reverse auction procedures for Cuyahoga County for the above detailed period.

 Reverse Auctions are best used with a good or service that has pricing that can be calculated fairly easily
and not subject to volatility. This process is optimal if there is a large pool of vendors that will be
qualified to bid. For each reverse auction, a list of qualified vendors to partake in the reverse auction
event is created as a result of a formal RFP. Only proposals which receive a qualifying score (excluding
pricing) as detailed in the RFP will qualify.
The Reverse Auction will be conducted for the items on a price List. A bid must be provided for each
item in the reverse auction or the proposal may be deemed non-responsive. The total price for all lots
will be calculated for each vendor based on each vendors’ bids, then scored in accordance with the Cost
Proposal Scoring Instructions located in the Cost Proposal & Pricing section of the RFP. The County shall
determine on a case by case basis performance bond requirements. The RFP will detail the performance
bond and insurance requirements.
Vendor shall submit bids in good faith and shall hold their lowest quoted bid, as submitted in the
reverse auction, for the length of the contract period.
The Office of Procurement and Diversity will provide advertising (if requested) and training - this will be
reflected in the RFP.
Anticipated training will be conducted at 9:30 a.m. in the Office of Procurement and Diversity, 2nd
Floor, Room 2-200, 2079 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44115. It is strongly encouraged that qualified
vendors attend the training.

Process For Determining Opening Bid Price
a. To set opening bid prices for the reverse auction, the User Department will identify
if the item was previously purchased within the last five years. If the exact item had
been purchased, in a similar quantity, the previous purchase price should be used for
opening bid price.
b. If the same item was not purchased recently, or was purchased at a different
quantity, the User Department should determine if the item is available via a state
contract, GSA contract, or other cooperative purchasing agreement available to
Cuyahoga County. If available via one of those methods from a bidder qualified to
provide the item, the price on that contract should be used. If the item is available
via multiple contracts, the lowest price should be used
c. If the opening bid pricing is not available from options A or B, the User Department
will review the initial response to the RFP from the vendors. The lowest initial price
of the item from the qualified vendors responding will be used for the opening bid
price.
d. The User Department is responsible for maintaining accurate records as to how the
opening bid price was determined.
e. This opening bid price should be a reasonable price that will encourage bidders to
participate. It is counterproductive to have an opening bid price that allows little room
for profit. As a function of the reverse auction process, once the auction process begins,
the price will start to be reduced.

42

 Reverse Auction Pricing Event Terms
a. Preliminary pricing (List) will be submitted with each vendors’ proposal.
b. Cuyahoga County shall work with Vendors to prepare for the auction event.
c. During the Auction event, only those Vendors on the qualified respondents list will be
allowed to participate in the auction event.
d. Cuyahoga County will provide the necessary administrative support to ensure that the integrity of
the auction event is not compromised.
e. Cuyahoga County will keep an event record, which will include the prices offered by the
Vendors.
f. The user interface will be configured such that a Vendor will not know the identity of competing
respondents during the auction event.
g. Cuyahoga County will begin the event through electronic notification to all qualified
Vendors.
h. Vendors may submit multiple prices during the event. The lowest price offered will
contribute to the price portion of the proposal response.
i. The auction event will have a scheduled stop time. The event will not be extended beyond the
scheduled stop time. However, if technical issues occur that impact the last hour of the bidding
period, OPD may extend the bidding period. If the bidding period is extended, OPD will notify
vendors of the revised scheduled stop time.
j. After the auction event has started, vendors may reduce prices during the event as they see fit.
k. The conclusion of the electronic auction event will be considered the Vendor’s best and final
pricing and will be the basis for the price evaluation.
l. Only one contract will be awarded. There will be no split awards.
m. If the county suspects malicious activity on behalf of any vendor, their proposal may be
deemed non- responsive or be awarded no points for the reverse auction.
Reverse Auction Vendor Instructions
a. The reverse auction will be conducted based on a price List.
b. The lot (if applicable) will consist of items from a List. No additional items will be added. An
updated list with specific lots will be provided to qualified vendors prior to the reverse auction.
c. During the auction, vendors will submit bids. This bid must be based on the quantities listed
on the price List.
d. For each bid submitted, the vendor must update and upload the price list with their bid. This
attachment must match the vendor’s bid or their proposal may be deemed non-responsive.
Technology Items - If the request is for the purchase of software or technical equipment: N/A
a) Please state the date of TAC Approval N/A
b) Are the purchases compatible with the new ERP system? N/A
c) Is the item ERP approved N/A

 BC2019-622
The Sheriff’s Department is requesting an alternate procurement approval for necessary small, time
sensitive purchases needed to maintain food service operations from local vendors. The request is to
establish a not-to-exceed award to multiple vendors through December 31, 2021 with an amount not-toexceed amount of $40,000.
The purchases needed are often items that are critical to the jail food service operations. While
Department and Purchase orders have already been put into place to cover these items, we cannot always
guarantee delivery dates, quantity available or items that are placed on back order from vendors.
The purchases are often emergency purchases needed immediately. In these situations, the jail staff has
to go to a local vendor to complete the critical purchase to continue jail food service operations. Such
purchases have historically been paid for on office vouchers or other means and processes, but annual
amounts for each vendor may exceed the $1,000.00 office voucher threshold. The alternate procurement
would allow for timely purchases to maintain jail food service operations, payments to vendors, and for
the Sheriff’s Department to remain compliant with Accounts Payables policies and procedures.
The amount of $40,000.00 was established from research done on past purchases made. The Sheriff’s
Department has spent approximately $5,000.00 annually on time sensitive purchases with each local
vendor in recent years. It is anticipated that after a full service vendor begins to service the Cuyahoga
County Jail kitchen these cost will decrease and eventually end.
This alternate procurement would allow for Department Orders to be processed for various small, time
sensitive purchases needed in the Jail kitchen to be completed by approved vendors. These individual
Department Order payments to local vendors would be processed in BuySpeed, providing the necessary
procurement documentation, but would not require additional board of control approval. Purchases that
are not critical to jail kitchen operations will continue to follow the established County procurement
procedures.
The anticipated approved vendors have historically provided various small time sensitive items needed
within the Jail without any notice. The vendors have been added to requisition SH-19-46224 in BuySpeed.
Process Under Alternate Procurement:
Jail staff will then contact an approved local vendor to confirm immediate availability for the needed
items.
The purchase is completed and an invoice/receipt is provided to the Sheriff’s Department Fiscal Office.
Sheriff Fiscal staff enters the purchase, invoice, receipt and procurement documents into BuySpeed.
The BuySpeed entry is sent to OPD for review and approval (No additional Board of Control Approval is
necessary).
A Department Order is created for payment.
Approved Vendors:
Grainger
Joshen
Dean Supply
Gordon Food Supply
