PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COUNTYWIDE CPR & AED TRAINING
AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AND EXPANSION OF TRAINING ACCESS
WHEREAS, in one year alone, 475,000 Americans die from cardiac arrest and globally, cardiac arrest
claims more lives than colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, influenza, pneumonia, auto
accidents, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), firearms, and house fires combined; and
WHEREAS, heart disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains the No.
1 cause of death in the United States, while the estimated annual incidence of heart attack in the U.S. is
720,000 new attacks and 335,000 recurrent attacks per year; and
WHEREAS, more than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside of the hospital each year and nearly 45
percent of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims survived when bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) was administered, as immediate CPR can double or triple chances of survival after cardiac arrest;
and
WHEREAS, similarly to national statistics, heart disease is the leading cause of death in Cook County as
well, accounting for just under 10,000 deaths per year with more than half occurring in suburban Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System along with the Cook County Department of
Public Health can contribute to decreasing the incidents of fatal heart attacks in Cook County by creating a
robust awareness campaign to increase participation of Cook County employees in existing training
programs on how to properly administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation and how to use an automated
external defibrillator (AED) as well as expand access to such trainings countywide in all County
workplaces; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois beginning in 2014 has made such training a curricula requirement for all
secondary schools in the state; and
WHEREAS, the County awareness and training initiative should cover adult CPR & AED training and
such training must include a hands-on practice component for beginners, as well as be in accordance with
6

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

December 12, 2018

the standards of the American Heart Association, or another nationally recognized certifying organization;
and
WHEREAS, any improvement in outcomes associated with heart attacks would have an immeasurable
impact on survivors both for County employees and their co-workers and families as well as the general
public.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners requests the development of a countywide CPR and AED training awareness campaign for
all Cook County employees as well as expanded access to training programs in all County workplaces in
order to assist in reducing incidents of death due to cardiac arrest both in the workplace and general public;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners requests
that the Cook County Health and Hospitals System along with the Cook County Department of Public
Health and their partners develop such awareness campaign and that the expanded training program shall
be in accordance with the standards of the American Heart Association, or another nationally recognized
certifying organization; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Health and Hospitals System or one of its partners
such as the American Heart Association provide this Honorable Body with statistics on the number of lives
that could be saved in Cook County by knowing and using CPR and/or AED; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the awareness campaign and expanded training access should begin
in February 2019 to coincide with American Heart Month; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that data on said awareness campaign and expanded training including
the total number of employees newly trained or re-trained in CPR and AED as well as their employment
location by district be added to the monthly and annual Cook County Health and Hospitals System reports.
Effective Date: This resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR A HEARING ON THE ILLINOIS BLOCKCHAIN TASK FORCE REPORT
AND THE APPLICATIONS OF ITS FINDINGS TO COOK COUNTY
7

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

December 12, 2018

WHEREAS, blockchains offer enormous potential for the storage and maintenance of data and records;
and
WHEREAS, a blockchain is a database that is replicated over a peer-to-peer network that is designed to
achieve consistent and reliable agreement over a record of events between independent participants through
consensus about changes to the state of the shared database; and
WHEREAS, blockchains allow digital information to be distributed, but not copied, making it very difficult
to inappropriately modify the original data. Anything of value, money, titles, deeds, votes, and identity
attributes can be exchanged, stored, and managed securely and privately; and
WHEREAS, there are a variety of potential applications of blockchains to manage the voluminous data
that Cook County manages, including, but not limited to, applications in the Office of the Cook County
Clerk, Recorder of Deeds, Assessor, Clerk of the Circuit Court and much more; and
WHEREAS, on November 30, 2016, the State of Illinois formed the Illinois Blockchain Initiative to
explore how Blockchain could help spur economic development in the State; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Blockchain Task Force was charged by Illinois House Joint Resolution 25, which
was adopted by both houses on June 28, 2017, to study aspects of distributed ledger technology that includes
opportunities and risks associated with using blockchain, different types of blockchains (public and private),
as well as projects and use cases in other states and domains that Illinois could consider utilizing; and
WHEREAS, on January 31, 2018, the Illinois Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force issued a
report on:
1) opportunities and risks associated with using blockchain and other distributed ledger
technologies,
2) the different types of blockchains, public and private,
3) projects and use cases in other states/nations that Illinois could consider,
4) how current state laws could be modified to support this technology,
5) encryption technology, including Illinois’ digital signature infrastructure, and
6) official reports and recommendations from the Illinois Blockchain Initiative.
WHEREAS, the Task Force found that that blockchain technology and its built-in encryption can facilitate
highly-secure methods for interacting with government and keeping paperless records, increasing data
accuracy and providing better cybersecurity protections for Illinois residents; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a joint meeting of the Legislation and Intergovernmental
Relations and Technology Committees of the Cook County Board of Commissioners convene to review the
Illinois Blockchain Task Force Report and the possible applications of blockchain technology within Cook
County.

Request: Approve the IGA for FY 2019, relative to the County’s proposed additional appropriation to the
Pension Funds, enabled by a portion of sales tax revenue.
Goods or Services: N/A
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Agreement Period: From date of execution through 11/30/2019

the Additional Funds shall be made as follows: $25,000,000.00 on or before the last day of the month
during January through October 2019; and $45,296,720.00 on or before 11/30/2019.
Accounts: 1490-580033
Summary: This proposed IGA, already approved and signed by the Pension Fund, would reflect the
County’s commitment to appropriate an additional $320,296,720.00 to the Pension Fund. As we stated in
the IGA for FY 2018, the agreement requires the Pension Fund to continue its commitment to providing
the County Board with actuarial data and certain reporting on its relative investment performance. This
FY 2019 IGA is in the same form as the FY 2018 IGA, as approved by the Board a year ago, with
revisions based on the total amount of the additional contribution and the payment of that amount over the
course of a year. The IGA reflects the undertaking of the Board and the Board President when the
decision was made to increase the sales tax by 1%.

pursuant to its home rule powers, as follows:
Section 1: Pursuant to the Findings of Fact made and determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals, a
Special Use Permit for a Planned Unit Development is granted to allow for the construction of a singlefamily residence dwelling within an “Environmentally Sensitive Area” as designated by the Cook County
Comprehensive Land Use and Policies Plan. The companion Variance (V18-29) requests to: (1) reduce the
lot area from the minimum required 40,000 square feet to an existing 13,129 square feet, (2) reduce the lot
width from the minimum required 150 feet to an existing 99.24 feet and (3) reduce the rear yard setback
from the minimum required 50 feet to a proposed 42.03 feet if granted under the companion Special Use
request. The Variance is sought in order to construct a single-family residential dwelling served by a well
and septic system, on the following described property:
LOT 149 IN FRANK DELUGACHS WOODED ESTATES SUBDIVIDION IN SECTION 18,
TOWNSHIP 36 NORTH, RANGE 12, EAST OF THE THIRD PRINCIPAL MERIDIAN, IN COOK
COUNTY, ILLINOIS.
P.I.N. 27-18-422-011-0000.
The common address is 15640 113th Court, Orland Park, Illinois 60467.
Section 2: This Ordinance and every provision thereof shall be considered severable. If any Section,
paragraph, subdivision, clause, sentence or provision of this Ordinance shall be adjudged by any Court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair, invalidate or nullify the
remainder thereof, which remainder shall remain and continue in full force and effect.
Section 3: All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed to the extent of
such conflict.
Section 4. This Ordinance shall become effective from and after its passage, approval and publication in
the manner prescribed by law.
Pursuant to § 13.8.9 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, the Board makes the following
Findings of Fact as to the Special Use:
1. Establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger
public health, safety or general welfare.
The proposed used use is to be a single family. Maintenance of public health, safety and general welfare
will be enhanced by eliminating an existing vacant property.

2. Establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the uses already permitted, nor
diminishes and impairs property values within the neighborhood.
The proposed construction will comply with the approved use for this parcel (single family residential)
and occupation by the family will provide maintenance of the presently vacant parcel in line with the
existing uses on adjacent and nearby developed parcels. Construction of this project will serve to
maintain or improve property values by providing stability of reducing one vacant lot in a mostly
already developed subdivision.
3. Establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for permitted uses.
The proposed improvement is completely in line with the normal, orderly development and
improvement of the area by providing a new single-family residence in a neighborhood composed
entirely of single family residences on small lots.
4. Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary facilities have been or are being
provided.
The area is presently developed with public utilities for gas, electric and telephone within dedicated
easements. This project will require the construction of access via an extension of 113th court under
permit from the township highway department. The Owners/Applicants have been coordinating design
efforts with Orland Township’s Engineer. Final design is not completed but will comply with all
Orland Township requirements. Initial review by MWRD was positive.
5. Adequate measures have been, or will be, taken to provide ingress and egress designed to
minimize traffic congestion in public streets.
Construction of one additional single-family home in this subdivision will not significantly impact
traffic operation on public streets in the area. The improvement will include construction of allweather access to the presently vacant property, within the existing township right of way for 113 th
court.
6. Establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use shall in all other respects conform to
all Cook County Ordinances, unless otherwise authorized by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners pursuant to the recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
With the exception of the Special Use for the Planned Unit Development and the requested setback and
lot size variances, the Special Use will conform in all respects to all Cook County Ordinances. The
Owner’s/Applicant’s testimony demonstrated that they would comply with any and all applicable
ordinances as well as any conditions recommended by the ZBA.
Pursuant to § 9.5.10 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, the Board makes the following
Findings of Fact as to the Planned Unit Development:
ARTICLE 9.5.10: STANDARDS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
1. PUD conforms with the planning objectives, policies and maps of the County as specified in the
Cook County Comprehensive Land Use and Policies Plan.
The proposed use is single family residential and the area is zoned for single family residential uses.
The proposed use is in compliance with County Standards for this lot within this area.
145

 Board of Commissioners

2.

Journal of Proceedings

December 12, 2018

PUD is a type and character and contains uses that are needed in the area.
The proposed use is single family residential. The area is zoned for and occupied by single family
residential uses on similarly sized lots. The proposed use is in the compliance with use that is needed
within this area.

3. PUD is designed and laid out to preserve environmentally sensitive areas, natural resources,
habitat and topographic features to the fullest extent possible.
The proposed design for this lot will not harm any natural resources or habitat. The lot is presently
maintained by mowing and there are no environmentally sensitive elements existing on the property.
The design minimizes the disturbed area by providing a moderate size house with limited changes to
the existing grades on the site. The proposed residence is planned to fit into the existing environment
with minimum disturbance.
4. PUD is designed in conformity with the provisions of the Cook County Subdivision Manual or
any successor subdivision document.
The proposed Application will not alter boundaries of the existing subdivision which was platted in the
1940’s. Although lot sizes within this subdivision do not meet current subdivision standards,
there are adequate public road and utility easement dedications to provide a healthy residential
neighborhood as was intended when the subdivision was approved. The proposed development
conforms to the original intent for this lot.
5. PUD is designed to provide horizontal spacing between buildings which takes into consideration
the purpose and objectives of this article.
The proposed construction will meet the requirements for yard setbacks as contained in the current
ordinance for this zoning district, except as specifically requested for variation. Nearby vacant
properties are unlikely to be developed in the future since they are either substantially in
the identified floodplain or sensitive wetland areas. This development will be adjoined by vacant uses
for the foreseeable future.
6. PUD complies with the industrial performance standards enumerated in Article 6 of this
Ordinance if the PUD contains industrial uses.
This is not applicable since the proposed improvement does not include industrial uses.
7. PUD complies with the parking requirements enumerated in Article 11 of this Ordinance.
The proposed improvement will provide two parking spaces within the garage and two additional
spaces in the driveway, complying with county requirements for single family construction.
8. PUD provides appropriate yards, setbacks and buffers between the PUD and adjacent zoning
lots.
The Owner/Applicant shall specifically request, in writing, any variance from the required setbacks.
The proposed development complies with the requirements for yards of the Cook County Zoning
Ordinance, except as specifically requested for variation. In compliance with the Ordinance for this
residential class, the front yard setback will be a percentage of the lot depth rather than the standard
dimension. This property will be served by an onsite sewage treatment system (septic system). Under
County Zoning Ordinance, minimum lot width shall be 150 feet. This width may be reduced by variance
as long as the county department of public health has approved a septic system design for the site. The
146

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

December 12, 2018

proposed septic design for this property has been reviewed and approved by the Cook County
Department of Public Health, and copies of the approval have been submitted to the Department of
Building and Zoning. The size of this lot is substantially the same as all the other lots in this
subdivision, all of which are required to be on well and septic and have received variances in the past.
9. PUD has adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary facilities.
The area is presently developed with public utilities for gas, electric and telephone within dedicated
easements. This project will require the construction of access via an extension of 113th court under
permit from the township Highway Department. The Owner/Applicant has been coordinating design
efforts with the township’s engineer. Final design is not completed but will comply with all township
requirements as well. Initial review by MWRD was positive. There are no storm sewers in the area.
No additional drainage problems will be created by the proposed development.
10. PUD has ingress and egress designed to minimize traffic congestion in public streets.
Construction of one additional single-family home in the subdivision will not significantly impact
traffic operation on public streets in the area. The improvement will include construction of all-weather
access to the presently vacant property, within the existing township right of way for 113th Court.
11. PUD and its maintenance and operation will not be detrimental to or endanger public health,
safety or general welfare.
The proposed use is to be a single family residence in a residential district. It will contribute positively
to the maintenance of public health, safety and general welfare by eliminating an existing vacant
property.
12. PUD and its maintenance and operation will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the uses already permitted, nor diminish and impair
property values within the surrounding area.
The proposed request will comply with the approved use for this parcel (single family residential) and
occupation by the Owners/Applicants will provide maintenance of the presently vacant parcel in line
with the existing uses on adjacent and nearby developed parcels. Construction of this project will serve
to maintain or improve property values by providing stability in the action of reducing one vacant lot
in a mostly already developed subdivision.
13. PUD and its maintenance and operation will not impede the normal and orderly development
and improvement of surrounding property.
The proposed single-family improvement is compatible with the surrounding single-family residences
in the area. It’s maintenance and operation will match that of the existing neighboring developed
properties and have no adverse effect on future development of vacant lots within the subdivision.
14. PUD shall provide more open space than would be required in a standard subdivision.
Due to the small size of this lot, there is no opportunity to provide more open space than already
provided on surrounding properties. The proposed house is designed with a moderate footprint and the
proposed driveway is short. Since the adjacent properties are environmentally sensitive areas, this
portion of the subdivision will have an abnormally large amount of open space for the foreseeable
future.
15. PUD shall be designed to connect to existing or planned pedestrian and bicycle systems in the
147

 Board of Commissioners

vicinity
There are no existing or planned pedestrian or bicycle systems in this area of the County.
Pursuant to § 13.6.3 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, the Board makes the following
Findings of Fact as to the Variance:
1. Physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the property would result in hardship
upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of this Ordinance
were followed.
The lots in this subdivision are substantially smaller than would be allowed today under the current
Ordinance. Every single-family residence proposed to be constructed on a single lot within this
subdivision requires granting of a variance in order to be constructed.
2. Conditions which are unique to the property exist and are not applicable to other properties
within the same zoning classification.
Lot requirements for this zoning classification include 150’ minimum lot width (with septic system)
and minimum area of 40,000 square feet. No lots within this subdivision can meet these requirements
without re-subdivision to combine several lots together for one project.
3. Variance sought is not based exclusively upon a desire to make the property more profitable.
The Owners/Applicants stated that they intend to construct this single-family home for their personal
use as the family residence.
4. Hardship or alleged difficulty is caused by this Ordinance and not by any person presently having
an interest in the property.
The hardship is caused by the current Zoning Ordinance requiring lot dimensions well in excess of the
dimensions of this lot as approved and platted in the 1940’s.
5. Variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other properties or
improvements in the neighborhood.
The lots in this subdivision are all smaller than would be allowed today under the current Zoning
Ordinance. Every single-family residence proposed to be constructed on a single lot within this
subdivision requires granting of a variance in order to be constructed. Granting of variation for this lot
will be a continuation of the practice of the Cook County in regard to furthering orderly development
of this neighborhood for over 60 years. Granting of the proposed variation will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other properties in the neighborhood.
6. Variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent properties, substantially
increase congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, cause increased flooding risk
to adjacent property, endanger public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values
within adjacent neighborhoods.
The proposed construction will meet the requirements for yard setbacks as contained in the Ordinance
for the R-4 Single Family District, except as requested herein. Nearby vacant properties are unlikely
to be developed in the future since they are either substantially in the identified floodplain or sensitive
wetland areas. This development will be adjoined by vacant uses for the foreseeable future.

148

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

December 12, 2018

Construction of an additional single-family home in this subdivision will not significantly impact traffic
operation on public streets in the area. The improvement will include construction of all-weather access
to the presently vacant property, within the existing Orland Township right of way for 113th court.
The proposed construction will fully comply with requirements of the Cook County Building Code and
the local Fire Protection District with regard to fire protection.
Construction of the proposed SU/PUD will not increase risk of flooding on adjacent properties since
all on-site work will be completed above the elevation of the defined flood plain and drainage onto
neighboring properties will avoided or minimized wherever feasible.
The proposed construction will comply with the approved use for this parcel (R-4 Single Family
Residential) and occupation will provide maintenance of the vacant parcel in line with the existing uses
on adjacent and nearby developed parcels. The proposed request will serve to maintain or improve
property values by providing stability of reducing one vacant lot in a mostly already developed
subdivision.
Section 5: SPECIAL USE: That this Ordinance under the provisions of Section l3.8.9 of the Cook County
Zoning Ordinance is in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval, except that if said use
is not established within one year as provided in Section 13.8.14 said Special Use for shall be null and void.
That said Subject Property be developed and constructed pursuant to the detailing set forth in the testimony
and contained in the exhibits and Findings of the Cook County Zoning Board of Appeals hereby
incorporated by reference into the Ordinance, as provided by law.

Section 2: This Ordinance and every provision thereof shall be considered severable. If any Section,
paragraph, subdivision, clause, sentence or provision of this Ordinance shall be adjudged by any Court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair, invalidate or nullify the
remainder thereof, which remainder shall remain and continue in full force and effect.
Section 3: All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed to the extent of
such conflict.
Section 4. This Ordinance shall become effective from and after its passage, approval and publication in
the manner prescribed by law.
Pursuant to § 13.8.9 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, the Board makes the following Findings
of Fact as to the Special Use:
1. Establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger
public health, safety or general welfare.
Polycrystalline solar panels will be used for this facility. This is opposed to what is called thin-film
solar panels which will not be used. The thin-film panels contain cadmium in them and they are largely
used down south. When you google solar PV dangerous chemicals, thin-film panels pop up, but
polycrystalline panels will be used here. Polycrystalline panels are essentially two sheets of plexiglass
with a solar wafer in the middle.
As for noise, the inverters are the only things that make any noise. The decibels drop from 65 at 1 foot
down to 29 at 64 feet which is the same as quiet rural night. The facility is at least 100 feet from any
neighbor, so nobody will be able to hear it.
EMFs is another issue that some people are concerned about. Solar panels are similar to any appliance
in your house. The EMFs from them are below a fluorescent lamp at three feet.
Another issue that has come up is how solar kills birds. Google can mislead searchers as it is
concentrated solar that is dangerous to birds, not solar PV. Concentrated solar is where all the mirrors
reflect to one spot that heats up water and fuels a generator, which is not what is being proposed here.
Concentrated solar is more common in a desert. Solar PV typically attracts birds as they are good
perching habitats for them.

A 2MW solar facility reduces carbon emissions by the equivalent of taking 717 passenger cars off the
road for one year. (October 10, 2018, pg. 48)
Finally, the SU is not detrimental to general welfare because of all the items already listed as they are
good for the health and morale of the citizens.
2. Establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the uses already permitted, nor
diminishes and impairs property values within the neighborhood.
The SU will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the vicinity for uses already
permitted for a few reasons. First, there will be no incremental runoff or soil erosion based on the fact
that there will be year-round ground cover. There single axis trackers, since they are constantly moving,
rain will not cause drip zones that would become an issue in the soil. Soil absorption will increase as
was discussed in prior standards. The year-round ground cover will allow for greater absorption by the
soil when compared to the soil that would lay bare outside of the growing season.
Again, the solar farm is quiet, so neighbors will not hear it. There will be no incremental EMFs, runoff
or erosion.
There will also be screening provided to screen the facility from neighbor’s view. The fence will also
be a game fence that is more suitable for neighborhoods when compared to the normal industrial chain
link fence. There will be no barbed wire on the fence and it will not be electrified.
Mr. Makofski testified that the SU would cause no damage to property values in the surrounding area.
In summary, he looked at a Cohn Reznick Report which looked at similar areas to the Subject Property
that had solar in proximity and found that there was no property value damage as a result. He was able
to take those findings and apply them to this site to determine that the SU would not damage property
values in the proximity.
3. Establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for permitted uses.
This development is normal and orderly as discussed earlier (reference no ability to develop housing)
and it will not impede normal and orderly development of surrounding properties.
4. Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary facilities have been or are being
provided.
There are adequate utilities already on-site. There will be a net positive on the drainage on-site. Under
normal circumstances, the Subject Property is an open field through most of the year and so it is sitting
there vacant with nothing on it. Plus, during the planting season, the soil is still not covered for most of
the time. The seed mixes that will be planted will completely cover the soil year-round, so it will be a
net positive to the drainage profile.
Access roads are incorporated into the plan and will intend on installing the minimal amount of road as
possible. Utilities will only be required for interconnection.
5. Adequate measures have been, or will be, taken to provide ingress and egress designed to
minimize traffic congestion in public streets.
153

The SU will not affect traffic flow and there will be virtually no additional traffic during operation. The
solar farms are quiet neighbors.
6. Establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use shall in all other respects conform to
all Cook County ordinances, unless otherwise authorized by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners pursuant to the recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
The SU will conform to all Cook County Ordinances.
Pursuant to Section 9.5.10 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, the Zoning Board of Appeals
makes the following findings as to the Planned Unit Development
1. PUD conforms with the planning objectives, policies and maps of the County as specified in the
Cook County Comprehensive Land Use and Policies Plan. The solar garden conforms with the
objectives, policies and maps of Cook County by staying outside of the environmentally sensitive areas.
Additionally, the solar garden will bring benefits to the community. The particular area in which the
Subject Property is was identified by the Fair
Housing and Equity Assessment (Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, 2013) as one of the
lowest opportunity areas for fair housing development. That suggests that this property should be used
for other types of development.
The Future Energy Jobs Act also provides a significant amount of money to put towards training low
income members of the community to work on the solar installation. That will provide another benefit
to the local community.
2. PUD is of a type and character and contains uses that are needed in the area.
The PUD does contain uses that are needed in the area. The Future Energy Jobs act requires 3,000MW
in Illinois. This project is 2MW so perhaps 1,000 of these projects will be needed with some projects
being larger.
Several other counties in the area surrounding Cook County, including Will, Grundy, Winnebago and
Kankakee, have dozens of applications. In Cook County, this project is the first one being heard. Space
like the Subject Property is hard to come by in Cook County. In order to keep these jobs in the county
and make sure members of this particular community receive the financial resources made available
under the Future Energy Jobs Act, projects like these are needed. Otherwise, those potential jobs will
be outside of Cook County.
3. PUD is designed and laid out to preserve environmentally sensitive areas, natural resources,
habitat and topographic features to the fullest extent possible.
The project location was selected to avoid the flood plains. The site was previously used for agriculture
but the IDNR determined no kind of habitat or resource issues in the area. There will be minimal foot
traffic after construction, no emissions and no kinds of chemicals.
4. PUD is designed in conformity with the provisions of the Cook County Subdivision Manual or
any successor subdivision document.
The PUD will be in conformity with the Cook County Subdivision Manual and the 7th Division
Manual.

5. PUD is designed to provide horizontal spacing between buildings which takes into consideration
the purpose and objectives of this article.
No buildings will be required and the spacing between the panels will be sufficient for driving
emergency or any other vehicles through them.
6. PUD complies with the industrial performance standards enumerated in Article 6 of this
ordinance if the PUD contains industrial uses.
The PUD complies with the industry standards for industrial performance 41-906.
7. PUD complies with the parking requirements enumerated in Article 11 of this ordinance.
No long-term parking will be necessary but there will be an access path that meets specific requirements
for emergency access and other needed services.
8. PUD provides appropriate yards, setbacks and buffers between the PUD and adjacent zoning
lots. The applicant shall specifically request, in writing, any variance from the required setbacks.
The necessary setbacks have been met plus some extra space.
9. PUD has adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary facilities.
There are adequate utilities already on-site. There will be a net positive on the drainage on-site. Under
normal circumstances, the Subject Property is an open field through most of the year and so it is sitting
there vacant with nothing on it. Plus, during the planting season, the soil is still not covered for most of
the time. The seed mixes that will be planted will completely cover the soil year-round so it will be a
net positive to the drainage profile.
Access roads are incorporated into the plan and will intend on installing the minimal amount of road as
possible. Utilities will only be required for interconnection.
10. PUD has ingress and egress designed to minimize traffic congestion in public streets.
The PUD will not affect traffic flow and there will be virtually no additional traffic during operation.
The solar farms are quiet neighbors.
11. PUD and its maintenance and operation will not be detrimental to or endanger public health,
safety or general welfare.
Polycrystalline solar panels will be used for this facility and are not detrimental to or endanger public
health, safety or general welfare This is opposed to what is called thin-film solar panels which will not
be used. The thin-film panels contain cadmium in them and they are largely used down south. When
you google solar PV dangerous chemicals, thin-film panels pop up but polycrystalline panels will be
used here. Polycrystalline panels are essentially two sheets of plexiglass with a solar wafer in the
middle.
As for noise, the inverters are the only things that make any noise. The decibels drop from 65 at 1 foot
down to 29 at 64 feet which is the same as quiet rural night. The facility is at least 100 feet from any
neighbor, so nobody will be able to hear it.
EMFs is another issue that some people are concerned about. Solar panels are similar to any appliance
in your house. The EMFs from them are below a fluorescent lamp at three feet.

Another issue that has come up is how solar kills birds. Google can mislead searchers as it is
concentrated solar that is dangerous to birds, not solar PV. Concentrated solar is where all the mirrors
reflect to one spot that heats up water and fuels a generator, which is not what is being proposed here.
Concentrated solar is more common in a desert. Solar PV typically attracts birds as they are good
perching habitats for them.
A 2MW solar facility reduces carbon emissions by the equivalent of taking 717 passenger cars off he
road for one year.
Finally, the PUD is not detrimental to general welfare because of all the items already listed as they are
good for the health and morale of the citizens.
12. PUD and its maintenance and operation will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the uses already permitted, nor diminish and impair
property values within the surrounding area.
The PUD will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the vicinity for uses already
permitted for a few reasons. First, there will be no incremental runoff or soil erosion based on the fact
that there will be year-round ground cover. There single axis trackers, since they are constantly moving,
rain will not cause drip zones that would become an issue in the soil. Soil absorption will increase as
was discussed in prior standards. The year-round ground cover will allow for greater absorption by the
soil when compared to the soil that would lay bare outside of the growing season.
The solar farm is quiet so neighbors will not hear it. There will be no incremental EMFs, runoff or
erosion.
There will be screening provided to screen the facility from neighbor’s view. The fence will be a game
fence which is more suitable for neighborhoods when compared to the normal industrial chain link
fence. There will be no barbed wire on the fence and it will not be electrified.
Mr. Makofski testified to the fact that the PUD would cause no damage to property values in the
surrounding area. In summary, he looked at a Cohn Reznick Report which looked at similar areas to
the Subject Property that had solar in proximity and found that there was no property value damage as
a result. He was able to take those findings and apply them to this site to determine that the PUD would
not damage property values in the proximity.
13. PUD and its maintenance and operation will not impede the normal and orderly development
and improvement of surrounding property.
This development is normal and orderly as discussed earlier (reference no ability to develop housing)
and so it will not impede normal and orderly development of surrounding properties.
14. PUD shall provide more open space than would be required in a standard subdivision.
There will be a 24% ground coverage ratio and so there will be a lot of open space, more that would be
required in a standard subdivision.
15. PUD shall be designed to connect to existing or planned pedestrian and bicycle systems in the
vicinity.
There will be no impact on pedestrian usage or bicycle systems.
