PUBLIC COMMENT FORMS
Please see the attached forms. In order to better administer the online public
comment process, there will now be one form for all meetings. That way residents
are able to register ahead of time without having to wait for new forms to be
created. Please see the below forms. Residents complete the same information,
however they must specify the meeting date and/or title. Residents are now also
able to upload documents and leave comments if they are not able to attend City
Council Meetings. If there are any special meetings or session scheduled, the forms
will be updated and a new link will be provided.
