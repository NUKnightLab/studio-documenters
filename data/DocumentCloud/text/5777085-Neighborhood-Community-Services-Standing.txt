Submitting reso. autho. Request of the Downtown Development Authority in conjunction

Woodward Ave. on the east, the south side of Henry St. on the south, Clifford Ave. and Cass
Ave. on the west and Sproat St. on the North; and to rezone a portion of the remaining B4
(General Commercial) zoned land along the east side of Cass Ave. between Sproat St. and
Henry St., and, as well as the to-be-vacated Henry Street right-of-way, to PD.
(REQUESTING 6TH EXTENSION OF REVIEW PERIOD)(CPC is pleased to report
that the revised petition #1388 requesting the right-of-way adjustments on and around
the arena site is being processed by City Engineering. This revised petition, if
acceptable to DPD and DWSD, should relieve the blockage to completing the vacation
of Henry and the other streets thus allowing the necessary sequence of events to proceed
in order to facilitate the long-held PD rezoning and modification. Consequently, the
CPC requests another 120-day extension of the review period to avoid having to restart the ordinance revision process over again at the Planning Commission. A
resolution to that effect is attached for Your consideration. The requested extension, if
granted, will expire by the close of the day Friday, July 26, 2019.) (REFERRED TO
