III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Lacey Rhoades, of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Committee’s consideration. She
stated that request number 6 is being withdrawn at this time. She added that request numbers 4, 7, 9, 22, 24
and 28 are currently pending Contract Compliance. Additionally, she presented a memorandum that stated
corrections and amendments for four contractual requests (Attachment #2).
Additional information was provided on the requests by the following individuals: LaVerne Hall, Director of
the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance; Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, System Chief Operating Officer;
Helen Haynes, System Associate General Counsel; and Tom Neuhs, of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).
Ms. Hall provided additional information regarding request number 18; she provided an overview of the
technique used to review, consider and finalize the minority and women-owned business enterprise
(MBE/WBE) participation goals for the contract. She stated that, with the prior contract, when they reviewed
the actual direct participation with John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, the participation level came
in at 2%. She further discussed the matter with representatives of Owens & Minor; Owens & Minor were able
to demonstrate that, although they had only come in at 2% with direct participation, they had spent over $8
million with Cook County minority and women-owned firms. Moving forward with this contract, Contract
Compliance has requested that Owens & Minor include mentoring and capacity building components.
Contract Compliance will be looking at the firms that Owens & Minor are using, and will monitor the amount
of spend that they have with these Cook County firms. She stated that, although these Cook County firms are
not specifically working on Stroger Hospital work, Owens & Minor have been asked to build the capacity of
these Cook County firms; as a result, the firms will be able to demonstrate not only the market share growth
that they’ve had with Owens & Minor, but also the jobs that they have created and retained for Cook County
residents, having developed this relationship with Owens & Minor. She stated that she will provide an update
on their progress at the end of the year.
Dr. Tedeschi provided additional information on request number 19. He stated that this contract will allow the
System to transform the way food is delivered to patients, from a cook-chill methodology to actual room
service. In addition Sodexo provides the infrastructure that allows the System to manage much better; along
with software, Sodexo brings education and tried and proven training methodology. He stated that, in his
experience, this type of service has transformed those support services within an organization.
Helen Haynes, System Associate General Counsel, stated that Sodexo will retain all revenues from the retail
operations that it conducts, as part of this transaction and pricing. Chairman Carvalho noted that, in prior
contracts similar to this, assumptions are made by the vendor as to volume, and when volume changes, the
vendor has often returned to the System, requesting to re-price the contract due to their initial assumptions.
Ms. Haynes stated that Sodexo is accepting full risk; Sodexo has assumptions that have been made with regard
to the revenue they will receive, as a result of the operation of the retail operations, but they have agreed to
fixed prices through the term of the contract. Tom Neuhs, of PwC, stated that there is a section in the contract
for reconciliation items; he noted that the contract has the flexibility to deal with the potential changes as the
System evolves.
In response to Director Muñoz’ question regarding the thirty-day cancellation clause, Ms. Haynes stated that
the contract has a bi-lateral six-month notice of termination for convenience; she added that this is a point that
is still being negotiated. Dr. Tedeschi noted that, with this type of contract, it would be difficult to have a
vendor exit in thirty days; it would take several months to get a replacement service in or to build one
internally.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to capital, Ms. Haynes stated that Sodexo is making certain investments to operationalize the
Sodexo model; in their termination language, Sodexo has requested reimbursement of their unamortized
portions of those investments, which are specified in the contract.
With regard to request number 21, Ms. Haynes noted that this request includes the provision of cytogenetics
services.
Director Golden, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 28, as amended, with the exception of request number 6, which is
being withdrawn, and noting that request numbers 4, 7, 9, 22, 24 and 28 are pending
Contract Compliance, under the Contracts and Procurement Items and Supplemental
Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request numbers 12, 15 and 16.
Director Muñoz abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 25.
Note: At the Board of Directors Meeting on June 24, 2011, request numbers 9 and
24 were withdrawn from consideration, as they were pending Contract Compliance.
C. Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #3)
This item was considered concurrently with Item III(B).

D. Proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements (Attachment #4)
Ms. Rhoades presented the requests for the Committee’s consideration. With regard to request number 3,
regarding the Family Practice Residency Program, Dr. Terry Mason, System Interim Chief Executive Officer,
stated that this program was moved to John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County a few months ago. Dr.
Aaron Hamb, Chief Medical Officer of Provident Hospital of Cook County, stated that these residents provide
services throughout the System.
Director Golden, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved to approve request numbers 1
through 5 under the proposed Academic Affiliation Agreements. THE MOTION
CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 4.

E. Proposed Resolutions – authorizing signatory updates for bank accounts for Provident Hospital of Cook
County and Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County (Attachment #5)
Director Golden, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved to approve the proposed
Resolutions authorizing signatory updates for bank accounts for Provident Hospital of
Cook County and Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

III. Action Items (continued)
F. Request for authority to enter into and execute a Memorandum of Understanding between the Cook
County Department of Public Health (“CCDPH”) and the Public Health Institute of Metropolitan
Chicago (“PHIMC”) to apply for the Public Prevention Health Fund: Community Transformation
Grant, referred to as CDC-RFA-DP11-1103PPHF11, and for PHIMC to act as the bona fide fiscal agent,
receiving and dispersing grant funds in accordance with the requirements of the funding source, should
the grant be awarded (Attachment #6)
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to approve the request for
authority to enter into and execute the Memorandum of Understanding. THE MOTION
CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho voted PRESENT.

G. Proposed Amendments to the CCHHS Procurement Policy (Attachment #7)
Ms. Rhoades and Ms. Haynes reviewed the proposed Amendments to the CCHHS Procurement Policy.
Additional information was provided regarding the process used for a reverse auction.
During the Committee’s discussion, Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding Section 7.1, Amendments to this
Policy; New Policies and Procedures. He inquired whether the intent for this section is that the System Chief
Executive Officer or designee may approve supplemental rules, policies and procedures – that are not
inconsistent with this Policy. Ms. Haynes responded affirmatively, and stated that she will include this
language as an amendment.
Director Golden, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved to approve the proposed
Amendments to the CCHHS Procurement Policy, as amended. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

H. Proposed Intra-Fund Transfers of Funds (Attachment #8)
Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer, presented the proposed Intra-Fund Transfers of Funds.
Chairman Carvalho noted that, in this request regarding Oak Forest Hospital, two-thirds of the funds are being
transferred into overtime. He inquired regarding the accounts from which the funds are being transferred. Mr.
Ayres stated that the funds are from specific contracts that have more dollars in them than the System believes
will be needed to be spent before the end of the year. Chairman Carvalho stated that the continued operation
of Oak Forest Hospital comes at a cost; to fund the continued activity at Oak Forest Hospital, he stated that it
would be good to know what the System will not be able to fund as a result of this. Mr. Ayres stated that this
transfer does not result in a discontinuation of any services, it just removes excess funds into another account;
he added that there could very well come a point in time when discussions may need to be held on proposed
discontinuation of services, but this transfer does not have that impact. Director O’Donnell stated that
presumably, at some point, the System will have some services that cannot be fulfilled if resources will be
taken from one area to continue Oak Forest Hospital inpatient operations.
Director Golden, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved to approve the proposed IntraFund Transfers of Funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Request for authorization to dispose of fixed assets (Attachment #9)
Dan Ruiz, Director of Materials Management at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, presented an
overview of the request for authorization to dispose of fixed assets. He stated that the disposal of these assets
will help to expedite the closure of the warehouse. The assets are generally composed of surplus equipment,
scrap metal and items that are unable to be used throughout the System. Board approval is needed in order to
dispose of these assets.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to approve the request for
authorization to dispose of fixed assets. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

J. Any items listed under Sections III, IV and VI

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Notification of Emergency Purchases (Attachment #10)
In accordance with Part II, Section 2.8 of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Procurement Policy
that states that emergency purchases be reported to the Finance Committee no later than at its next regularly
scheduled meeting, the Committee received information on the emergency purchases that have been made.
Also in accordance with the Policy, a communication in writing was sent to Chairman Carvalho and Board
Chairman Batts on this matter.

B. Presentation of Lawson Financial Statements through April 2011
This item was withdrawn.

C. Impact of Health Reform on CCHHS (Attachment #11)
Mr. Ayres reviewed the information provided regarding the Impact of Health Reform on CCHHS.
During the review of the information, Director O’Donnell inquired regarding the System’s overall effort to
engage the communities and make the residents aware of the services that the System offers. Mr. Ayres stated
that in the System’s FY2011 Preliminary Budget, there was $2 million budgeted to start general public
relations information and awareness; however, the System was unable to get that funded and move it forward.
He stated that it is a resource-availability issue. Dr. Mason stated that the problem is that the System has not
been able to implement the Plan; this is not due to a lack of will, but rather due to a lack of resources.
Chairman Carvalho suggested that, if management believes that the funding for the public relations
information and awareness activities is a priority, then they should consider the possibility of transferring
funds for that purpose.
Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding the presentation of this information to staff throughout the organization.
Dr. Tedeschi stated that, although parts of it have been presented and worked on by various members of the
organization, presenting this health care reform information throughout the organization is a good educational
opportunity for the System.

Report from System Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #12)
A. Report of Paid Board Bills (included in Attachment #12)
Mr. Ayres stated that there has been a lot of interaction recently with the County regarding the FY2011 Budget,
including discussion of the forecast through year-end, and the development and preparation of the FY2012
initial forecast. A timeframe for the System to provide information to the County was developed.
Chairman Carvalho noted that the FY2012 Budget is expected to be particularly challenging. He suggested
that the Budget review and deliberations be done at the Board level, rather than through the five-member
Finance Committee; this will allow for the full Board’s participation, and will reduce the need to go through
detailed information and discussions more than once. Chairman Batts agreed; he added that the System Board
will need to be able to examine the preliminary budget on a line-by-line basis.
Mr. Ayres provided information regarding the forecast through year-end, with regard to Oak Forest Hospital.
He stated that a review took place, which took into consideration the implications of having to maintain Oak
Forest Hospital and the System’s inability to move resources. He recalled that the analysis that was performed
when the Certificate of Need (CON) was rejected, which indicated that the cost to maintain Oak Forest
Hospital in its current platform would cost approximately $10 million. He stated that, following review of Oak
Forest Hospital’s current spending, and projected spending through year-end, it appears that there will be an
overspend of approximately $6 million, instead of the originally estimated $10 million. He stated that there
will need to be a $6 million fund transfer to Oak Forest Hospital in order to get the hospital through the end of
the year, assuming that the System continues on its current path through November 30th.
Mr. Ayres stated that if one reviewed the System as a whole, based on the current analysis, it appears that the
System will be approximately $20 million under budget; however, there are a couple of factors that are not
included. One factor is the issue of furlough days, and how that charge will be played out. He stated that the
County took a charge for furlough days; the System was allocated approximately $16.8 million of that charge.
There have been two furlough days; management is attempting to analyze the effects. He stated that the first
furlough day did not provide much change in the overtime or regular hours; however, the second furlough day
is showing some change. He stated that the System pays approximately 5,200 full-time equivalent employees
(FTEs) per two weeks. When the second furlough day occurred, there was a reduction in hours equal to 470
FTEs. Overtime, however, went the other way. The normal overtime spend is approximately 390 FTEs per
two week period; however, there was an increase of 66 FTEs for that period. He stated that, in order to
maximize the value related to the shutdown days, the System will need to create some sort of dynamic to really
reduce the on-site presence of System employees; otherwise, the System will be unable to capture that savings.
He indicated that, currently, his estimate of the System’s captured savings with regard to the $16.8 million
furlough day charge is in the $10-12 million dollar range.
Mr. Ayres informed the Committee that Dr. Mason was successful in receiving authorization from the County
to move forward with the implementation of a time and attendance component through the Lawson System.
He stated that he expects the implementation to take approximately four months.
Mr. Ayres informed the Committee that management has been able to reach an agreement with Hektoen on the
treatment of System grants. A fiscal agent agreement has been signed by Hektoen representatives; this
agreement is expected to be brought before the System Board for approval. Chairman Carvalho requested
information outlining the differences or changes between the fiscal agent agreement and the previous draft
document that was approved by the System Board several months ago but was never executed.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
This is a request to increase the current contract with Gen-Probe Inc. to provide Mycobacterial and fungal probes
used for TB and Fungal Identification testing manufactured and distributed by Gen-Probe Inc. for the Department of
Pathology. A 25% increase in the number of positive TB results has been identified due to the centralization of the
Laboratory to Stroger Hospital. Provident and Oak Forest hospitals and CCHHS clinics submit TB tests to the Stroger
Hospital Laboratory for testing. When positive TB test results are received, it is required to test each of the TB fungal
probes to determine the accurate TB Mycobacterial (there are four TB fungal probes: Avium complex, M. gordonae,
M. kansasii and M. tuberculosis).
The Gen-Probe supplies are proprietary to the existing Gen-Probe instruments in the Department of Pathology:
LEADER 50 and LEADER 450 Luminometers. The firmware in these instruments is necessary for the running of
assays and is proprietary to Gen-Probe. Gen-Probe is the sole provider of this firmware.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
This is a request to increase the contract amount by $40,000.00 to correct the previous board approval request
submitted to the Board of Directors of CCHHS on 0412912011. The amount needed to provide upgrades to server
hardware and end user devices (computers, printers, laptops and monitors), and to provide additional storage for
clinical systems is $1 ,240,000.00. The previous board approval request was for $1 ,200,000.00. An additional
$40,000.00 is needed to complete the amendment previously approved by the Board of Directors of CCHHS.
This contract provides all computer equipment needed for Cook County Health and Hospitals System. The increase
is needed due to end user devices that require replacement to support the increased demands of throughput.
Included in this amendment will be upgrades to servers and end user devices that have reached their lifespan and no
longer support the current application demands. The increase in end user utilization frequently causes slow response
times and reduced productivity. Current utilization has 1,700 to 1,800 users accessing the current system with
degradation experience experienced during peak shift times. This increase includes server hardware, additional
storage for clinical systems, and end user devices (computers, printers, laptops and monitors).

telephone and pager networks to reach environmental service employees who then access all necessary information
through an Interactive Voice Response System. Using a browser or handheld device, supervisors can follow
progress in real-time and quickly react to emerging situations. Reporting features show employee performance and
volume trends to ensure proper staffing levels. This improved communication and information flow helps reduce the
number of STAT cleaning requests, improves bed turnover and helps streamline and optimize patient flow.

M/WBE goal and its bid being within 10% of the lowest qualified bidder.

the correct vendor name, justification and fiscal impact sections.  The amendment, extension and 
increase are requested to:

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
Previous service was supported by in-house management teams as well as several suppliers across CCHHS with
non co-terminus contract periods. Each agreement varied in service level delivery and satisfaction.
NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
The proposed contract is the result of an extensive and highly competitive RFP process involving three different
vendors. Vendor presentations and proposals were reviewed by a selection committee consisting of 10 multidisciplinary members who evaluated the submissions based on a criteria matrix which included each providers
current capabilities and ability to support Key Performance Indicators as expected under the new contract service
levels. The team narrowed its selection to Sodexo America, LLC based on the lowest pricing structure and highest
service level commitment of any of the other vendor; it was determined that Sodexo America, LLC submitted the
most comprehensive RFP. Based on these factors, an overwhelming majority of the selection committee members
voted to recommend the future contract be awarded to Sodexo.
The new agreement will become a CCHHS system agreement. More specifically, Sodexo will provide Food and
Nutritional Services (FANS) and Environmental Services (EV) at Stroger, Provident and Oak Forest hospitals under
the proposed agreement. Sodexo will also provide Patient Transport (PT) Services for Stroger Hospital. As part of
their service to CCHHS, Sodexo will be providing the necessary management labor, supplies and software.
For Patient Transport and Environmental Services, Sodexo will be providing management labor and supplies at a
guaranteed fixed cost. For Food Services, Sodexo will also provide management labor at a fixed cost as well as food
and supplies that will fluctuate mildly according to changes in patient days, catering requests, etc. Given the

Operations and Maintenance Management Information Systems Services include the provision of certain software,
hardware, and technical support for Plant Operations and Maintenance within the CCHHS. Ambulatory Facilities and
Equipment Management Services revolve around services in connection with a program for coordinating the
management of CCHHS ambulatory equipment and facilities.
NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICAT10N:
The proposed contract is the result of an extensive and highly competitive RFP process involving three different
vendors for multiple. service offerings. Vendor presentations and proposals were reviewed by a selection committee
consisting of 10 multi-disciplinary members who evaluated the submissions based on a criteria matrix which included
each providers current capabilities and ability to support Key Performance Indicators as expected under the new
contract service levels. The team narrowed its selection to Aramark Healthcare with respect to POMMIS/AFS
services based on two primary reasons. In addition to Aramark Healthcare being the incumbent vendor, they were
the only vendor to submit a proposal for the Plant Operations and Maintenance Management Information Systems
Services (POMMIS) and Ambulatory Facilities Services (AFS) portion of this multi-service RFP. Furthermore, these
services are considered to be highly specialized and the other vendors conceded they were not equipped to run the
operation.
The new agreement will become a CCHHS system agreement. Aramark Healthcare will continue to provide
POMMIS/AFS services at Stroger Hospital as well as expanded coverage across the system. POMMIS includes the

 Health Care Reform
Impact to Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Impact to Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Executive Summary
To prosper in the post‐reform world, health executives will need to reassess current strategies and find ways to work together.  This 
report illustrates the major trends that providers will face as a result of health reform and the financial impact to Cook County Health 
and Hospitals System (CCHHS).   
Overview of Key Health Reform Findings
•
•
•
•
•
•

Medicaid: there is an expectation that the currently uninsured will shift into Medicaid, creating a boost in Medicaid volume.  However, specific to Cook 
County and the State of Illinois, it is unclear if existing levels of Medicaid payments can be expected given the expected reduction in uninsured and the 
g
transition to Medicaid managed care.
Exchanges: expectation that the currently uninsured will shift into programs through the exchanges, however it is unclear if payment levels can be expected 
to be much greater than Medicare.
Medicare: a cumulative 0% to 5% increase in inpatient payments from 2011 to 2015 and similar trends on outpatient activity and relative to market basket a 
cumulative 9 to 14% differential.
Commercial: no better than inflationary increases can be expected.  In addition, depending on the nature of employer groups, some level of existing volume 
under commercial insurance will shift to exchange programs.
Self‐pay: the level of uninsured may decrease, however, secondary self‐pay will continue to escalate.
Beginning in 2015, a 300‐bed hospital with poor quality metrics could be penalized by more than $3 million per year: Even more important, these 
hospitals could suffer reputational damage as these metrics are published online, the most popular place for consumers to seek health information.  In 
addition, some quality metrics will be measured on a relative basis resulting in increased pressure for hospitals to improve quality.

Impact to CCHHS
The results of the assumptions delineated from the CCHHS Strategic Plan and Health Reform initiatives would impact net revenue by approximately $35M 
compared to the baseline.  Moreover, if CCHHS experiences 40% attrition and a subsequent reduction in projected volumes, and does not meet Health Reform 
quality measures, net revenue could be impacted by an additional $60M.
The following are approximate variable adjustments to Net Patient Service Revenue (NPSR) Cook County Health and Hospitals System could expect:

What can an institution expect in terms of revenue trends under health reform:
o

Medicaid – expect that currently uninsured will shift into Medicaid creating a boost in
Medicaid volume. However,, specific
p
to Cook County
y and the State of Illinois,, can existing
g
levels of Medicaid payments be expected given the expected reduction in uninsured and the
transition to Medicaid managed care?

o

Exchanges – expect that currently uninsured will shift into programs through the
exchanges however can payment levels be expected to be much greater than Medicare?
exchanges,

o

Medicare – a cumulative 0% to 5% increase in inpatient payments from 2011 to 2015 and
similar trends on outpatient activity and relative to market basket a cumulative 9 to 14%
differential

o

Commercial – no better than inflationary increases can be expected. In addition,
depending on the nature of employer groups, some level of existing volume under
commercial insurance will shift to exchange programs.

o

Self-pay – the level of uninsured may decrease, however, secondary self-pay will continue
to escalate.

 Key CCHHS Baseline Volume Assumptions
For the purposes of this analysis, the following assumptions were made when
developing the baseline:
1. Oak Forest eliminating IP Services by end of 2011
2. Provident reducing OB/GYN and ICU IP Services by end of 2011
3. Outpatient growth concurrent with transition of Provident and Oak Forest
facilities to Regional Outpatient Centers (ROC) by 2013
4. Volumes remain flat for services not noted above
5. No inflation

 Health Reform Impact Analysis Summary
Based
B
d on currentt state
t t assumptions,
ti
the
th impact
i
t to
t nett revenue would
ld be
b approximately
i t l $35M
compared to the CCHHS baseline. Moreover, if CCHHS experiences 40% attrition and a subsequent
reduction in projected volumes, and does not meet Health Reform quality measures, net revenue
could be impacted by an additional $60M.
The following are approximate variable impacts to Net Patient Service Revenue (NPSR) CCHHS
could expect:

•

Strategic Plan Variable Impacts
–
–

•

1% increase in attrition results in $3M loss annually
1% decrease in Strategic
g Plan Volumes results in $500K loss annually
y

Health Reform Variable Impacts
–
–
–
–

Each 1% reduction in the Medicare rate related to any of the quality metrics is worth $750K
annually
1% decrease in State DSH (Phased in from 2014-2016) results in $1M loss annually
1% decrease in BIPA (Phased in from 2014-2016) results in $1.5M loss annually
1% decrease in Commercial Rate Increase results in $3M loss annually
