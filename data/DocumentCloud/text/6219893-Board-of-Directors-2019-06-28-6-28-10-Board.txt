C. Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting, June 20, 2019
i. Metrics (Attachment #2)
ii. Meeting Minutes, which include the following action items and report:
• Code of Ethics for Cook County Health
• Audit and Compliance Committee Charter
• Policy on Corporate Compliance Reporting to the Governance Authorities of Cook County Health
• Corporate Compliance Hot Line Charter
Dr. Shannon provided comments regarding the recent report from the Office of the Independent Inspector General
(OIIG) regarding CountyCare healthcare expenses. Below is the verbatim record of his comments.
We received the OIIG Report last week, at the same time that everyone else did. Our team continues to review
it in detail. Our intention is to fully respond to the Report. I’ll remind us that, with the timing of its release
on June 21st, we are required by resolution to respond to the OIIG by August 5th. However, just as a headsup, there has been a called meeting of the Health and Hospital Committee of the County Board that will be
held on July 25th, the day before our Board Meeting. That meeting will have as content at this point two
agenda items. One item will be to talk about concerns that have been raised about timeliness of payments to
safety net hospitals from the Health Plan, and the second item would be responding in a significant way to
the observations and recommendations in the OIIG Report that was sent out last week.
I do want to make four specific points as to the integrity of the Health System, the Health Plan, and our team,
which I believe has been unfairly questioned. The reputation of this Plan is critical to the success of the
Health System and thus, I think it is necessary to respond this morning with some details, and again,
recognizing that a very detailed and comprehensive written response will be forthcoming.
First, and most importantly, I want to point out that the observation in the Report that the Health System was
sitting on $700 million of unpaid bills from 2018 and that those are perhaps still out there, is not correct.
The Health System today does not have $700 million in unpaid bills from FY2018. The number that the OIIG
referenced was the 2018 year-end estimate of actual and potential liabilities. The actual liabilities that are
remarked in December of 2018 are in fact all paid, entirely all paid, by February of 2019.
The second point I would make is that the Health Plan is indeed strong. How can I say that? Well, in the
last five years, as an example, the Health Plan has contributed more than $1 billion in revenue to Cook
County Health as a provider of care, at the same time that our local tax allocation supporting healthcare
operations has decreased very significantly. I want to remind everyone that we were receiving more than
$480 million toward our operating budget in 2009 when this independent Board was established. Today,
because of a number of improvements, but most importantly, the Affordable Care Act and CountyCare, local
tax support to our operating budget is $102 million. This consistent reduction in our local tax allocation has

 Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors

allowed the Cook County Board to redirect $2.5 billion over the last ten years to purposes other than the
Health System. This is something that could not have happened without CountyCare.
Third, if we intend to stay true to the mission of Cook County Health, then we need the Health Plan. You’ve
heard us say before that our Health System provides roughly half, in fact in our most recent year, more than
half, of all of the charity care in Cook County. Without the revenue from the Health Plan, there’s no way
that we could cover those expenses unless there was a significant influx of revenue from local taxpayers.
The last point that I want to make this morning is around allegations of a lack of transparency that were in
the OIIG Report. As a public entity, we not only report and discuss our financial performance publicly every
month with you and our Finance Committee, but also with the full Board. We subsequently transmit those
reports to the County Board and all of the information is posted on the website on the same day that we
present that information at our Health System Committee and Board meetings. As many of you are aware,
since the time that the Plan was birthed, we have modified our financial reporting at the encouragement of
this Board to make that reporting more useful, more clear, more utilitarian, if you will. And we are always
open to the opportunity to improve the clarity of that reporting. But the notion that we have not been
transparent is simply wrong. I know of no other health system that is as open, not only with our opportunities
for public speakers, but the actual transparency of what we transmit. Virtually everything we do gets put up
in our minutes, and all the material gets put up on the website, including, as we’ll talk about later, the strategic
planning.
We started CountyCare in 2013 and we’ve built it to be the largest Medicaid health plan in Cook County.
This has not been easy. But you need only to talk to the members of the Health Plan to understand how
coverage has changed their lives and the impact it has had on their health. This Plan has, in addition, allowed
us to expand our impact as a healthcare system, to address social determinants of health, such as food and
housing insecurity, and to expand and greatly strengthen treatment for behavioral health and addiction
disorders across the healthcare system. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished and I’m proud of the team
that’s leading CountyCare and works everyday to provide our members and patients with the care they
deserve. We will work in the coming weeks to respond in a detailed and comprehensive fashion to all the
observations in the Report from the OIIG.

action is to schedule appointments by calling Cottage Grove at (708) 753-5800. The campaign will run on
Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Google through the end of August. We will measure impressions and clicks,
which will take viewers to the pop up on the website.

As part of our ongoing community outreach in Ford Heights, on Saturday, June several CCH employees visited
Ford Heights to cheer on and support the Ford Heights Little League program. CCH has been a proud sponsor of
the program for the last few years.

State

The Illinois General Assembly concluded their Spring 2019 session on June 2.

While the session did not end on the scheduled deadline of May 31, major pieces of legislation, including a
balanced state FY2020 budget, a constitutional amendment allowing for a graduate income tax along with
accompanying rates, a Medicaid omnibus bill, a new assessment on managed care, gaming expansion, a
comprehensive capital bill along with new revenue sources, recreational cannabis, and the Reproductive Health
Act, were passed by the General Assembly.

The Governor has 60 days to take action on bills that are sent to him by the General Assembly. if he takes no
action, the bill goes into effect on day 61.

531321, also referred to as the Medicaid Omnibus Bill, passed the House and Senate unanimously; the Governor
is expected to sign it.

$81321 intends to address challenges with the state?s eligibility system and resulting delays in processing
Medicaid applications and redeterminations. The bill also seeks to improve the relationship between providers
and Medicaid MCOs by requiring HFS to establish a claims dispute resolution process, establishing policies and
timelines for MCOs to update provider rosters, and ensuring stakeholder engagement in efforts to improve MCO
operations and further develop value-based payment models. The bill goes into effect upon becoming law.

CCH reviewed and provided input towards the Medicaid omnibus bill from its perspective as both a health care
provider and a Medicaid managed care plan. -

101?0008 establishes six new tiers of state income tax rates, instead of the single rate of 4.95% that
presently applies to all income levels. PA 101-0008 can only go into effect if the associated constitutional
amendment (SJRCA 1) is approved by voters in November 2020, which requires 60% of the ?yes? votes OR a
simple majority of ?yes? votes among all ballots cast.

According to the Governor's office, 97% of ?lers should see a tax reduction with the new tax rates. The new tax
rates would only apply to incomes in the specific brackets, while those in the highest tier (those earning more
than $750,000 for single filers and those earning more than forjoint filers) would have their entire income
taxed at the highest tier Currently the flat tax rate is 4.95%)

New rates would be effective no earlier than January 1, 2021.

The House and Senate passed a comprehensive capital bill (H862) that includes vertical and horizontal projects,
funded by new state bonding, gaming expansion revenue, doubling the motor fuel tax, a $1/pack increase in the
state cigarette tax, and other increases on various taxes and fees (53690 and SB1939).

The bills passed with bipartisan support from both chambers. These package of bills have been sent to the
Governor and await his action. in addition to individual projects named in H362, the capital bill also includes
for "Hospital and Healthcare Transformation" and for "the Community Health Center Construction
Act?.

The bills are effective July 1, 2019 unless otherwise noted.

With the September 30 end of the federal fiscal year looming, the House completed work on the first package of
appropriations for FY 2020, including funding for the US. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
While a deal to lift the statutory budget caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011 remained elusive, House

continued bi-partisan work on measures to reign in prescription drug prices.

On June 12-13 Dr. Shannon and President Preckwinkle traveled to Washington DC to meet with members of the
Illinois Congressional delegation. Topics of discussion included the importance to Cook County Health of
Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments and the 3403 Prescription Drug Discount Program.

DSH funding is set to expire September 30, 2019. In FY19 will receive in DSH funding. if the cuts
go into effect on October Cook County Health would lose this coming year. Dr. Shannon and President
Preckwinkle urged members of the delegation to extend DSH funding into FFY2020 and beyond.

Congress established the 3408 program more than 20 years ago to provide financial relief from high prescription
drug costs to safety-net hospitals. The 3408 program provides Cook County Health with approximately in
annual savings. The savings realized from this program allow us to not only to provide much needed
pharmaceuticals but also frees up our limited resources to provide additional health services for our uninsured
and low-income patients. Any efforts to reduce or scale back the 340B program would significantly impact our
ability to continue to serve the most vulnerable patients in Cook County.

Budget and Appropriations

On June 19, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hosted the first meeting since May with House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Minority Leader Kevin
McCarthy (R-CA), Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney in
pursuit of an agreement to lift the statutory budget caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011. If they fail to
reach agreement, automatic across the board cuts, called sequestration, would be imposed, amounting to about

ten percent for most federal programs.

Meanwhile the House took up the first FY 2020 appropriations ?minibus," which included four regular bills
reported out by the full Committee on Appropriations: Labor-HHS-Education (H.R. 2740), Defense (H.R. 2968),
State-Foreign Operations (H.R. 2839), and Energy and Water (H.R. 2960). After several days of floor
consideration over two weeks, including votes on hundreds of amendments, the House voted to approve the

measure 226-203 on June 19.

The bill funds HHS at $99.4 billion, which is $8.9 billion more than the FY 2019 level and $21.3 billion above the
President?s budget request. The bill includes policy riders which would block the Administration from
implementing regulations to expand short term health plans and allow health care workers to refuse to give care
on religious or moral grounds. The President has issued a veto threat against the bill, citing the increased
domestic spending levels and restrictions on his policy initiatives.

Meanwhile, Senate appropriators have not introduced any of their annual spending bills. Senate Appropriations
Chairman Richard Shelby (R-AL) has said that ifa deal on new budget caps has not been achieved by July 1 then
he would pick proxy numbers to start moving the FY 2020 bills.

Medicaid

On June 4 the House Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Health held a hearing on the so-called
?health care extenders? programs whose authorization or funding runs out and must be extended. Panel
members on both sides of the aisle expressed support for the programs including community health centers, the
National Health Service Corps and teaching health center GME and others. The subcommittee also discussed
legislation (H.R. 3022) introduced by Rep. Elliot Engel which would repeal the Affordable Care Act?s
reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments. While all the subcommittee members
who spoke on the subject agreed that the cuts to DSH should not go into effect, Republican members objected

to the Engel bill because it is not paid for and because it does not rebalance Medicaid DSH state allocations,
which they argue are out of date and not fair.

Cook County Representative Bobby Rush made a strong statement in support of the Medicaid DSH
program and its importance to CCH during the hearing.

Health Care Costs

0 On June 18 the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing on draft
legislation aimed at reducing health care costs. On June 19 the committee released the bill, 5.1895, the Lower
Health Care Costs Act of 2019. The bill contains provisions designed to address surprise billing, reduce
prescription drug prices, promote transparency, improve public health and improve the exchange of health
information. The public health provisions include:

a national campaign to improve awareness of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and combat
misinformation;

- directs HHS to develop and disseminate a guide for state and local health departments on evidence-based
strategies for public health department obesity prevention programs;

1: authorizes grants for local health departments to modernize their public health data systems;

- establishes a maternal health grant program for the training of health care professionals to reduce and
prevent discrimination, including training related to implicit biases, in the provision of health care services
related to prenatal care, labor care, birthing, and postpartum care;

0 requires a study on training to reduce and prevent discrimination;

- requires CDC to set up state perinatal quality collaboratives;

authorizes HHS to award grants to states for providing integrated services for pregnant and postpartum
women; and

0 extends mandatory funding for community health centers, the National Health Service Corps, and teaching
health centers that operate GME programs.

The HELP Committee will mark the bill up the week ofJune 24.

The Senate Finance Committee plans to roll out its bipartisan package of provisions in itsjurisdiction, including
Medicare and Medicaid, after the July Fourth recess.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.

ANNUAL BUSINESS
DIVERSITY REPORT
PRESENTATION
FISCAL YEAR 2018
TONI PRECKWINKLE, PRESIDENT
COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS

COMMISSIONER STANLEY MOORE, CHAIRMAN
COMMITTEE ON CONTRACT COMPLIANCE
EDWARD H. OLIVIERI, DIRECTOR
OFFICE OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE

 MISSION

The mission of the Office of Contract Compliance (OCC) is to ensure the full and equitable participation of
minority, women and veteran-owned businesses (MBE/WBE/VBE) in the procurement process as both prime and
sub-contractors for Cook County Government and Cook County Health and Hospitals Systems (CCH). The
OCC seeks greater inclusion of MBE,WBE and VBEs on County and CCH contracts by conducting outreach
activities to the business community about the County’s Program.

2

 HISTORY OF M/WBE PROGRAM

 First enacted in 1988, the M/WBE Program was designed to remediate past County discrimination against

minorities and women on construction contracts.
 The Program evolved over time to apply also to goods and services contracts, as well as professional services

contracts; ultimately being extended to health and hospital contracts.
 In 2000, the construction portion of the Program was ruled unconstitutional, and Cook County was without

M/WBE participation on construction contracts for several years.
 Under the leadership of President Preckwinkle, the Program now is on firm constitutional footing supported

by Cook County’s first ever Disparity Study in 2013.

3

 CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFENSIBLE PROGRAM
 The Program is subject to Strict Scrutiny, the most exacting form of judicial

review, which requires that Cook County establish 1) that the County
participated in discrimination against minorities and women; and 2) that its
program to remedy those past wrongs is narrowly tailored to accomplish its
remedial purpose.
 The Program follows the format of the federal DBE program which includes caps

on personal net worth and adherence to the SBA size standards.
 The Program is supported by a Disparity Study and includes a sunset date to

ensure continuous econometric analysis to justify the Program’s maintenance

4

 NARROWLY TAILORED PROGRAM
 Goals are set on a contract-by-contract basis, no blanket goals or quotas
 Size of the contract, term of the contract, amount of subcontracting opportunity, availability

of M/WBEs to provide a commercially useful function on the contract

 Waiver Review Process when Good Faith Efforts to achieve the goals are

demonstrated
 Race and Gender-Neutral Measures to remedy past discrimination
 Prompt Payment Provision in Cook County Ordinance
 Outreach Program (OCC, Supply Chain Management and User Departments partnering with

Commissioners,Assist Agencies and other units of government)
 Anti-Discrimination Enforcement (Cook County Commission on Human Rights, OIIG, OCC)
 Unbundling large contracts (OCC, Supply Chain Management and User Departments)
 Holding pre-bid conferences (Supply Chain Management)
 Providing timely information on contracting opportunities and establishing schedules for

submitting bids with adequate time (OCC and Supply Chain Management)
