LAW DEPARTMENT

   

CITY OF DETROIT
MEMORANDUM

To: Honorable City Council

From: Mary Parisien 
Assistant Corporation Counsel
City of Detroit Law Department

Date: February 8, 2019

Re: Bed Bug Assistance Program.

 

On November 28, 2018, Council President Brenda Jones requested that the Law
Department draft an ordinance providing policies and guidelines for the establishment of a bed
bug assistance program. The program, if implemented, is an initiative designed to provide
resources for landlords and tenants who are unable to pay for the cost of eradicating bed bugs in
their homes or businesses. The funds would be provided to individuals, from the City, on a ?rst
come, ?rst serve basis, to those who can demonstrate a need for the funding. The overall goal
would be for the program to help those in need eradicate bed bugs and live in a healthier, more
comfortable environment. The Law Department has completed its review of the legality of

implementing said program.
SHORT ANSWER

The Detroit City Council does not have the authority, pursuant to the Michigan
Constitution of 1963, to allocate City funds to a program that provides assistance to individuals,
either landlords or tenants, who suffer from bed bug infestations. However, in accordance with
Sections 18-4-1 through 18-4-7 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, the City, through the Housing and
Revitalization and Health Departments, may apply for state and federal grant money that may be
placed in a fund designated for providing resources to residents in need of assistance exterminating

bed bugs.

LAW AND ANALYSIS

I. MICHIGAN CONSTITUTION OF 1963

Generally, municipalities have the power to expend funds only for a public purpose. If a
bed bug assistance program is established it would violate the State Constitution if the City were
to extend its credit to, or on behalf of, private individuals. Michigan?s Constitution Article VII,
Section 26, prohibits such actions and provides:

Except as otherwise provided in this constitution, no city or village shall
have the power to loan its credit for any private purpose or, except as
provided by law, for any public purpose. (Emphasis Added)

Public Purpose Test

Article 9, Section 18 of the Michigan Constitution states ?the credit of the state shall not
be granted to, nor in aid of any person, association or corporation, public or private, except as
authorized in this constitution.? The Michigan Constitution makes clear in its language that
expending public funds for a private purpose shall not be allowed. As such, the implementation of
a bed bug assistance program is prohibited by the Michigan Constitution.

The Michigan Supreme Court in Hays v. Kalamazoo was careful not to give a de?nite
de?nition of the term "public purpose?.1 Instead, the Court established a test to determine the
objective of a public purpose and stated:

Generally, a public purpose has for its objective the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals, general welfare, security, prosperity, and
contentment of all the inhabitants or residents within the municipal
corporation, the sovereign powers of which are used to promote such
public purpose. The phrase ?municipal purpose? used in the broader sense
is generally accepted as meaning public or governmental purpose as
distinguished from private. The modern trend of decision is to expand and
liberally construe the term ?public use? in considering State and municipal
activities sought to be brought within its meaning. The test of public use
is not based upon the function or capacity in which or by which the
use is furnished. The right of the public to receive and enjoy the
bene?t of the use determines whether the use is public or private.2
(Emphasis Added)

 

1 Hays v. City ofKalamazoo, 316 Mich. 443, 454, 25 787, 790?9] (1947).
2 Hays v. City ofKalamazoo, 316 Mich. 443, 454, 25 787, 790?91 (1947).

 

February 8, 2019
Page 3

Applying the test set forth in Hays to determine whether the proposed bed bug assistance
program is an appropriate expenditure, the program seeks to confer a bene?t to some individuals
by providing monetary support to remove bed bugs from their homes. Since the direct bene?t is to
some individuals and does not affect the overall public health, safety, morals and general welfare
of all the inhabitants and residents in Detroit it is a cause that is private in nature, making it a
Violation of the State Constitution for the City to expend public funds in this manner.

The utilization of City funds toward a private purpose such as the assistance program,
would be in direct violation of the state?s lending of credit prohibition. Monies allocated to the
program that come from the City would be used directly for the bene?t of private citizens to assist
them in treating the infestation without the City receiving reimbursement. Essentially, the City
would be donating money to fund the program, which is an expenditure prohibited by state law.

II. GRANT FUNDING - 1984 DETROIT CITY CODE

The policy objective seeks to enhance the living conditions for landlords and tenants who
are affected by a bed bug infestation. This goal may still be accomplished with the use of potential
grant money that would fund the bed bug assistance program instead of City funds. The City
currently has not applied for grants that would address individuals who need assistance eradicating
bed bugs. Additionally, the City would not be able to disburse federal funds it is currently receiving
unless they are for the speci?c purpose of eradicating bed bugs. In other words, grant money found
in existing housing and health grants cannot be utilized toward this objective because the criteria
for those grants does not encompass bed bug assistance. Therefore, the City through the Housing
and Revitalization and Health Departments may apply for any grants that may exist that would
address bed bug matters. The 1984 Detroit City Code, Sections 18-4-1 through Section 18-4-7
sets forth the process requiring City Council approval for the City to apply for federal, state and
other governmental grants. Speci?cally, Subsection states in part:

City council approval, by resolution, shall be required prior to the ?ling
by the city of an application for a federal, state or other government grant
to be used, in whole or in part, to fund any city programs, services or
activities. . .

Therefore, in order to begin the application process to obtain grant money to fund a bed
bug assistance program City Council would be required, per the 1984 City Code, to approve the
matter by resolution. After approval by Council, applications may then be completed and ?led in
order to receive assistance from available resources provided by the federal or state government
that would speci?cally assist those in need of bed bug assistance.

 

February 8, 2019
Page 4

It may also be worth noting that although the City may not fund a bed bug assistance
program due to state law restrictions, there are other ways of providing assistance to landlords and
tenants alike who suffer from bed bug infestations. For instance, Council of?ces may provide
landlords and tenants with pamphlets created by the state to spread awareness, methods of
preventing and removing bed bugs in a safe way and contact information to helpful resources. The
City?s Health Department may be an avenue to collaborate with and provide assistance as well.

CONCLUSION

In sum, City Council is not authorized under state law to provide City monies for the
purpose of funding a bed bug assistance program, however the City may apply for any available
grants to provide assistance to those affected by bed bug infestations.

RE: Response to Questions Submitted by Council Member Castaneda-Lopez Requesting
Information on City Blight Fund Spending

Honorable City Council:
To support demolitions in non-Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) areas, the City of Detroit uses Blight
Funds, Fire Insurance Escrow funds, and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds.

Each year, City Council approves the budget appropriating prior year surplus into the Blight Fund.

Since July 2018, 189 residential structures in non-HHF areas have been demolished. An additional
232 are contracted for and anticipated to be demolished in 2019.

Since July 2018, the City has completed 11 commercial demolitions in non-HHF areas.

The attached report provides the addresses of those demolitions.

If you have any questions about the information contained in the attached list, please contact Brian
Farkas of the Detroit Building Authority (iarkasbfiftdetroitmEgg), or Julie Schneider

(schueideriur??tdetroilmi .gov).

Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 1333 Prince Realty LLC, request to vacate alley between 4842 Grand
River Avenue, and 4885 15th Street.

Petition No. 1333 Prince Realty LLC requesting the vacation and conversion to easement of
the east-west public alley, 20 feet wide, in the block of Grand River Avenue, 100 feet wide, West
Warren Avenue, 70 feet wide, 16th Street, 60 feet wide, and 15th Street, 60 feet wide.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility review)
and report. This is our report.

The request is being made to consolidate properties on both sides of the alley.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, and Traf?c Engineering Division
DPW, and City Engineering - DPW.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the conversion to easement.
The speci?c DWSD provisions for easements are included in the resolution.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies have reported no
obj ections to the conversion of the public right-of-way into a private easement for public utilities.
Provisions protecting utility installations are part of the attached resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.
Res ctfully submitted,

RE: Petition o. 1759, Yousif Kashat request for encroachment in an alley located

behind 2001 Woodward Avenue.

Petition No. 1759, Yousif Kashat request to encroach with an exterior compressor platform
on the south side of the east-west alley, 10 feet wide, in the block of Adams Avenue, 60
feet wide, Elizabeth Street, 60 feet wide, Park Avenue, 60 feet wide and Woodward

Avenue, 120 feet wide.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility

review) and report. This is our report.

The request was made as part of retail store renovation where an existing compressor
platform would be replaced with a new compressor platform attached to the building.

DPW Traf?c Engineering Division objects to the encroachment because it would cause
an obstruction to vehicles traversing the alley. DTE Energy also objects to the
encroachment as they must maintain access to their underground facilities at all times.

DPW City Engineering Division (CED) has been in contact with the petitioner and they

have verbally withdrawn their request.

Whereas, The Department of Public Works Traf?c Engineering Division and DTE
Energy object to the proposed encroachment; and the petitioner has withdrawn their

request.

Therefore, City Engineering Division DPW recommends DENIAL of this petition
request. Please accept this report and receive and ?le it for your reference.
