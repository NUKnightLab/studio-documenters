 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 19, 2002
WHEREAS, discrimination, prejudice, intolerance and bigotry directly and profoundly threaten the rights
and freedom of Cook County residents; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has passed ordinances to protect the civil rights of those who live and work
within the County, including the prohibition of discrimination based on sex; and
WHEREAS, despite these protections, there are still citizens who are denied their civil rights because
their gender identity, appearance or behavior differs from that traditionally associated with their sex at
birth; and
WHEREAS, gender-based discrimination often leads to Joss of employment, housing and refusal of
services in public accommodations.
NOW, THEREFORE, in order to protect these citizens, the Cook County Board of Commissioners
proposes that the term "gender identity," as defined, be added as an amendment to the Cook County
Human Rights Ordinance (Ordinance No. 93-0-13, approved and adopted March 16, 1993).

that "a County which has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of the County .. . [is] a Home
Rule Unit" and the County of Cook, Illinois (the "County"), has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the
electors of the County and is therefore a Home Rule Unit and may, under the powers granted by said
Section 6(a) of Article Vil of said Constitution of 1970, exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination occasioned thereby threaten the
rights and proper privileges of the County's inhabitants and menace the institutions and foundation of a
free and democratic society; and
WHEREAS, behavior which denies equal treatment to any individual because of his or her race,
color, sex, age, religion, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, parental
status, military discharge status, source of income, gender identity, or housing status undennines civil
order and deprives individuals of the benefits of a free and open society; and
WHEREAS, in order to create a free and open society, it is necessary to provide the protection
set forth herein on a county-wide basis.
BE IT AND IT IS HEREBY ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, AN
ORDINANCE to assure that individuals within the jurisdiction of Cook County shall be protected in the
enjoyment of civil rights, and to promote mutual understanding and respect among all who live and work
within this County.

WHEREAS, discrimination, prejudice, intolerance and bigotry directly and profoundly threaten the rights
and freedom of Cook County residents; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has passed ordinances to protect the civil rights of those who live and work
within the County, including the prohibition of discrimination based on sex; and
WHEREAS, despite these protections, there are still citizens who are denied their civil rights because
their gender identity, appearance or behavior differs from that traditionally associated with their sex at
birth; and
WHEREAS, gender-based discrimination often leads to loss of employment, housing and refusal of
services in public accommodations.
NOW, THEREFORE, in order to protect these citizens, the Cook County Board of Commissioners
proposes that the term "gender identity," as defined, be added as an amendment to the Cook County
Human Rights Ordinance (Ordinance No. 93-0-13, approved and adopted March 16, 1993).

electors of the County and is therefore a Home Rule Unit and may, under the powers granted by said
Section 6(a) of Article VII of said Constitution of 1970, exercise any power and perfonn any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination occasioned thereby threaten the
rights and proper privileges of the County's inhabitants and menace the institutions and foundation of a
free and democratic society; and
WHEREAS, behavior which denies equal treatment to any individual because of his or her race,
color, sex, age, religion, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, parental
status, military discharge status, source of income, gender identity, or housing status undermines civil
order and deprives individuals of the benefits of a free and open society; and
WHEREAS, in order to create a free and open society, it is necessary to provide the protection
set forth herein on a county-wide basis.
BE IT AND IT IS HEREBY ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, AN
