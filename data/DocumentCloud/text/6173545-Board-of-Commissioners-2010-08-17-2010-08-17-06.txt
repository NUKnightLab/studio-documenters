 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids for general contractors to install new wrought iron fencing, swing gates and motorized
sliding gates around the Alfreda Barnett Duster Apartments at 150 So. Campbell. The new
fencing will encompass the parking lot and a lawn area as well as the building. Any landscaping
affected by the installation work will be protected or replaced if damaged. The fence installation
and associated site work and landscaping is to be completed within one hundred twenty (120)
calendar days.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 00530 on May 18, 2010 for the
installation of new fencing and gates, plus associated site work and landscaping, at Alfreda
Barnett Duster Apartments (IL2–043). The IFB was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the
Chicago Defender and El Dia, and on the CHA website and in BuySpeed.
The first Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit were held on May 20, 2010. A second Pre-Bid
Conference and Site Visit were held on June 8, 2010. The CHA issued Addendum No. 1 on June
2, 2010. It announced the date and time of the second Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit,
provided a new deadline for Requests for Information, extended the Bid Due Date to June 21,
2010, responded to Requests for Information received to date, and issued an updated DavisBacon Wage Decision. Addendum No. 2 was issued on June 11, 2010 to distribute an additional
drawing.
The CHA received and opened five (5) bids, three (3) from contractors certified as MBE
businesses, on June 21, 2010 at 11:00 am. The Department of Procurement and Contracts
determined that two (2) bid submittals were non-responsive due to the omission of a number of
required documents.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department (CCD) held pre-award survey meetings with the two (2)
lowest apparent responsive and responsible bidders. Each firm responded to questions on the
thoroughness of its bid and its capacity to perform this work. Their responses were determined to
be acceptable by the CCD staff.
Based on their submitted bid, the Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that
Oakley Construction Company. Inc. (Oakley) is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at
$110,000.00. Oakley has considerable experience as a general contractor for CHA renovation
efforts, including as part of the current Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) program.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with Oakley
Construction Company, Inc. in the amount of $110,000.00 for the installation of new fencing,
along with associated site work and landscaping, at Alfreda Barnett Duster Apartments (IL2–
043), 150 So. Campbell Ave. The work is to be completed within one hundred twenty (120)
calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section
3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
