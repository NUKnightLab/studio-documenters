2. Justice Assistance Grants
A. FFY14 and FFY16 Plan Adjustments
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated November 16, 2017,
regarding the FFY14 and FFY16 Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Plan Adjustments. He
described $120,108 in funds recently returned to ICJIA. He then described $685,226 in
recommended designations supporting Partnerships and Strategies to Reduce Violent
Crime.
Staff provided program-specific details relating to the recommended designations.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the FFY14 and FFY16 JAG Plan Adjustments.
Ms. Kramer seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous voice vote, with a recusal
by Ms. Dunne due to her connections to Be Well Health and the McDermott Center.
B. Court Programs Notice of Funding Opportunity
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated November 16, 2017,
regarding the Court Programs Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO). He said that staff
requested permission to use $1,350,000 in available FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 JAG
funds to support the NOFO. He said the NOFO employs a three-pronged strategy
designed to offer mid-system agencies resources for planning, operations, and
implementation of new plan-based programming. He said that this NOFO would support:
1. Operational Effectiveness - Both local and state agencies that are current JAG
recipients will be eligible to apply under this funding category. Applicants will be
required to demonstrate effectiveness of and the ongoing need for their program.
Funding minimum and maximum values will be based on the population served,
as follows:

2. Planning - The proposed NOFO will earmark $250,000 for grants ranging from
$25,000 to $50,000 to support cooperative local planning processes to identify the
drivers of local crime and the programs to address the identified problems.
3. Plan-based Implementation Projects - $500,000 will be earmarked to support the
implementation of prosecution and public defense projects identified through a
local planning process as addressing local criminal justice issues.
Associate Director Givens called attention to the NOFO timeline.
ICJIA Program Specialist Maureen Brennan said that the Operational Effectiveness
programming portion of the NOFO would only support currently-funded public defense
and prosecution agencies. The Planning and Plan-based Implementation Projects portions
of the NOFO would not be limited to any particular type of agency. Agencies that apply
for and receive Planning funding will be the ones that propose the most robust and
comprehensive planning processes. The Plan-based Implementation Projects
programming will support agencies that have already undertaken planning processes.
Executive Director Maki said that this NOFO was designed to attract as many
stakeholders as possible while accommodating local dynamics.
A discussion ensued regarding how best to attract as many stakeholders as possible,
particularly those with fewer available resources, while maintaining the integrity of the
competitive nature of the NOFO.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the Court Programs NOFO. Ms. Wolff seconded
the motion and it passed by unanimous voice vote.

3. National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated November 16, 2017,
regarding the FFY17 National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act (NFSIA) Plan
Introduction. He said that on September 29, 2017, ICJIA received the FFY17 NFSIA
award to Illinois in the amount of $307,162. He said staff was requesting permission to
make designations. He said after administrative costs, $284,492 was available for
programming. He explained NFSIA funds are used improve the quality and timeliness of
forensic science and medical examiner/coroner’s office services, including services
provided by laboratories operated by the state and/or units of local government. He called
attention to a chart describing which entities would receive the recommended
designations.

Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the NFSIA FFY17 Plan Introduction. Ms. Dunne
seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Mr.
O’Grady due to his relationship with the Illinois State Police.

4. Victims of Crime Act
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated November 16, 2017,
regarding the FFY16 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Plan Adjustments. He said that
staff recommended designating $999,506 in FFY16 VOCA funds to the Hektoen
Institute’s Healing Hurt People (HHP-C) program that combats community violence. He
said that at the October 25, 2017, Budget Committee meeting, the Budget Committee
acted to defer consideration of this designation due to unresolved legal issues. General
Counsel Weis said legal staff had concerns regarding the structure of the grant and
Hektoen’s ability to properly monitor the work described.
ICJIA Associate General Counsel Bereziewicz said Hektoen has acted as a fiscal agent
for Cook County Health Systems for decades. She said they provide pre-grant human
resources to direct service providers and grant fiscal management. She said the model
under consideration would support direct service providers in two locations for two
different entities and possibly a third. ICJIA wanted to ensure that the correct program
oversight was in place in the grant agreement, as well as in the two sub-grant
agreements, she said. She said program personnel will be employed by Hektoen, not the
hospitals in which they will work, and the direct services will be floating depending on
the locations at which the services are needed at any given time.
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt said that the NOFO was written with
consideration given to all of the VOCA guidelines and mandates, so all approved
applications were VOCA-compliant. Hektoen’s application received one of the higher
scores, but the organization structure was so unique that it demanded special attention, he
said.
Motion: Ms. Dunne moved to approve the recommended FFY16 VOCA designation to
the Hektoen Institute. Ms. Kramer seconded the motion and it passed by unanimous voice
vote, with a recusal by Ms. Wolff due to her involvement with Stroger Hospital.
