As indicated in Resolution 2684, the City requests 47 parcels of the requested 56 to allow redevelopment
opportunities along our Dixie Highway Commercial Corridor and 154th Street in our Downtown Business
District, which is in close proximity to the Municipal Center.
In addition, the City has two (2) Third Party Requestors, EQ Illinois and Outreach Community
Development Corporation. EQ Illinois is requesting one (1) parcel of commercial property for the
expansion of their business in Harvey. Outreach Community Development Corporation is requesting
eight (8) parcels of land to redevelop residential properties to increase the housing within the City of
Harvey.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. The City will report as required to the
Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually from the date of sale on each parcel for five (5)
years or until the development is completed. If a City of Harvey lien is cleared by the no cash bid, the
City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the City than the cost of the
municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the lien after the tax sale
for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the communication be referred to
the Finance Subcommittee on Tax Delinquency. (Comm. No. 13-1545). The motion carried
unanimously.

PROMOTING NATIVE VEGETATION IN PUD’S
WHEREAS, Cook County recognizes that a variety of landscapes add diversity and richness to the
quality of life and there is an intrinsic value in the preservation, restoration and management of native
plant habitat; and
WHEREAS, Cook County also recognizes the practical value of native plants which provide a beautiful,
hardy, drought resistant, low maintenance landscape while benefiting the environment; and

4

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

WHEREAS, Native plants, once established, save time and money by eliminating or significantly
reducing the need for fertilizers, pesticides, water and lawn maintenance equipment; and
WHEREAS, Native plants produce long root systems that help hold soil in place and protect water
quality by controlling soil erosion and moderating floods and droughts; and
WHEREAS, Native plants provide shelter and food for wildlife attracting a variety of birds, butterflies,
and other animals by providing diverse habitats and food sources while closely mowed lawns are of little
use to most wildlife; and
WHEREAS, Native plants promote biodiversity and stewardship of our natural heritage and is
increasingly important as we continue to lose native habitat. According to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency there are approximately 20 million acres of lawn cultivated in the U.S., covering more
land than any single crop. Lawns may look neat and attractive, but they are basically deserts in regard to
biodiversity. Native plants are a part of our natural heritage and natural landscaping is an opportunity to
reestablish diverse native plants; and
WHEREAS, Cook County recognizes the need to increase biodiversity in urban and suburban areas and
promoting native vegetation will help to accomplish this.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Part II
Land Development Ordinances, Appendix A Zoning, Article 9 Planned Unit Development of the Cook
County Code is hereby amended as follows:
9.0 Purpose.
The primary purpose of a planned unit development is to insure that developments are consistent
with the intent purpose and policies of the Cook County Comprehensive land Use and Policies Plan. It is
intended that the PUD will encourage innovative land planning, architecture, landscape architecture and
site amenities beyond that which would be possible through strict application of the Cook County Zoning
Ordinance of 2001. The PUD shall work in conjunction with the Cook County Building and
Environmental Ordinance (Chapter 30 of the code), the Cook County Subdivision Manual the Cook
County Flood Prevention Ordinance and the Cook County Comprehensive Land Use and Policies Plan.
The PUD shall provide for preservation of natural site amenities such as vegetation, of which
75% percent or more shall to comprised of native plants, topography and other unique physical site
characteristics, the creation of urban amenities, the creation of additional open space and generally the
design and development of unique, high quality projects.
The PUD provides for projects with either a single type of land use or a variety of land uses
developed as a unified project.
Approved and adopted this 11th day of September 2013.

8

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

WHEREAS, the Metropolitan Rail Board or METRA is tasked with running one of the largest
metropolitan rail systems in the country; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that the METRA Board of Directors have the confidence of the public they
serve to oversee the Chicago region’s commuter rail service; and
WHEREAS, there are a number of serious problems regarding the board’s mishandling of important
issues such as illicit influence and questionable contracts that undermines public confidence in the
organization; and
WHEREAS, a recent preliminary audit conducted by the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) into
the Alex Clifford separation agreement states the “process was inadequate and not sufficiently
documented” and the “settlement was not financially prudent”; and
WHEREAS, METRA Board Directors failed to consider Employment Practices Liability insurance on
any potential litigation or settlement, which would have provided coverage if a lawsuit was filed by Mr.
Alex Clifford; and
WHEREAS, the continued lack of proper oversight by the METRA Board of Directors has cost the
taxpayers and ridership significant dollars and resources; and
WHEREAS, in a letter dated July, 2011 the six (6) county chairmen from the Chicago region committed
to replacing all present METRA Board Directors by June 30, 2012 “ in order to restore faith within the
leadership’s body” as a result of the scandal involving the former METRA Chief Executive Officer; and
WHEREAS, the public has grown suspicious and skeptical as more allegations surface making it
impossible for the remaining METRA Board Directors to continue in their positions with any public
confidence; and
WHEREAS, at least six (6) METRA Board Directors are needed for quorum to ensure that day to day
METRA operations continue unabated.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request letters of resignation of the remaining three existing Cook County METRA Board
Directors; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the three existing Cook County METRA Board Directors will continue
to serve at the pleasure of Cook County Suburban Caucus until suitable replacements are selected; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners strongly urges the
remaining METRA Board of Directors to not take any substantive action regarding the hiring of a Chief
Executive Officer or appointment of a Board Chairperson until all remaining METRA Board Directors
have been replaced and a new full METRA Board has been seated.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE GREGG GOSLIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
CONTAINING COST FOR ANNUITANT HEALTHCARE
WHEREAS, the Cook County Annuity and Benefit Fund bears the majority of costs for providing
healthcare to Cook County Annuitants; and
WHEREAS, many pension funds around the State face the same problems with funding shortfalls; and
WHEREAS, healthcare costs have risen at unprecedented rates adding to the Cook County Annuity and
Benefit Fund’s further financial uncertainty with current estimates of the funds insolvency by 2038; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Annuity and Benefit Fund currently pays between 49-55% of retiree’s
healthcare premiums and Cook County contributes 0%; and
WHEREAS, other similar government agencies fund a large portion of their annuitants healthcare such
as: Police 55%; Fire 55%, Municipal 55%, and the MWRD 75%; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois State Statute does not require that healthcare be provided to annuitants; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Annuity and Benefit Fund has implemented many changes in annuitant’s
healthcare plan to help control costs but more must be done to keep the Fund solvent.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests the
Board of the Cook County Annuity and Benefit Fund to investigate the annual cost savings for several
scenarios for changes to the healthcare benefit including: both elimination and gradual reduction of
benefits to annuitants; both reduction and elimination for future annuitants; and both reduction and
elimination of benefits for annuitant’s spouse or partner opting into healthcare; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of the Cook County Annuity and Benefit Fund provide
a report to the Cook County Board with the results of the investigation by the end of the first quarter
2014.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A PROPOSED RESOLUTION URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
TO CREATE STRICTER CRITERIA FOR WHO CAN SERVE
AS A METRA BOARD DIRECTOR
WHEREAS, the Metropolitan Rail Board (METRA) is responsible for overseeing a $713 million budget
and operating one of the largest metropolitan rail systems in the country; and
WHEREAS, recent scandals involving Alex Clifford’s separation agreement have rocked the METRA
Board and caused the resignation of the METRA Board Chairman and several Directors; and
WHEREAS, the METRA Board of Directors have a fiduciary duty to our taxpayers to ensure that the
fiscal and operational health of METRA is sustainable; and
WHEREAS, public confidence in the METRA Board of Directors is at an all-time low and therefore
more accountability measures need to be instituted; and
WHEREAS, 70 ILCS 3615/ 3.01 vests authority in the suburban members of the Cook County Board
and the Cook County Board President to appoint five Directors to the METRA Board; and
WHEREAS, the only criteria that 70 ILCS 3615/ 3.01 sets forth for the appointment of a Director is that
they reside in suburban Cook County; and
WHEREAS, proper management and oversight by the METRA Board demands basic requirements from
an appointed Director; and
WHEREAS, chief among these requirements should be a threshold age limit, educational level, and
professional background.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the
Illinois General Assembly to codify basic requirements in order for an appointment to serve as Metra
Board Director.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

protect the dignity of the deceased that are brought into the Cook County Medical
Examiner’s Office.
Sec. 38-133. Death caused by wrongful act; liability for expenses incurred.
Any person, individual, partnership, corporation, firm, company, trust, estate,
political subdivision, state agency, or any other legal entity who causes the death of a
decedent by a wrongful act, carelessness, or negligence which shall be subject to a Medical
Examiner’s investigation shall be liable to pay any and all expenses incurred by such
investigation and the associated burial expenses. The same shall be recoverable by the
county.
Sec. 38-134. Transportation costs.
All transportation costs of the body incident to the Medical Examiner's
investigation shall be recoverable from the estate of the deceased. The Medical Examiner
shall have no responsibility or obligation to arrange for transportation of bodies to the
Medical Examiner’s facility.
Sec. 38-135. Fees.
The Medical Examiner shall charge the following fees with the amounts as set in
Section 32-1 of this Code.
(1)

Autopsy report.

(2)

Toxicology report.

(3)

Miscellaneous reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police

reports.
(4)
Permit to cremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the
Medical Examiner,
by facsimile or electronic filing.
(5)
Return fee. The Return Fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies
from the Medical Examiner’s Office and then request to return them to the Office after
determining that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of the
burial shell and the burial cost.
(6)
Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made
later than one year of the person’s death (due to a return by Funeral Home). The Office of
the Medical Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for
amendments made to a death certificate after one year of the death.
(7)
Storage fee. This fee covers the bodies returned (by the Ffuneral Hhomes)
to the Office of the Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial
services and bodies brought to the Medical Examiner’s Office from hospice, nursing
homes, and hospitals for cases not falling under Medical Examiner jurisdiction as defined
in Sec, 38-118. This "storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns

118

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

a body and picks it up again within ten days. If the body is not picked up within ten days,
the body will be held and buried by the County according to the standard operating
procedures of the Medical Examiner. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the Office
of the Medical Examiner as a storage location by funeral homes and also encourages the
funeral directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from
the Office of the Medical Examiner. The ability to accept cases for storage will be at the
discretion of the Medical Examiner and will depend on the current and anticipated morgue
census. This “storage fee” discourages the use of the Office of the Medical Examiner as a
storage location for non-Medical Examiner cases or cases that have been discharged from
the Medical Examiner’s Office to funeral homes and encourages funeral directors to verify
that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the Office of the Medical
Examiner. In the cases of funeral homes, this “storage fee" would replace the "return fee"
if a funeral home returns a body and picks it up again within ten days. If the body is not
picked up within ten days, the body will be held and buried by the County according to the
standard operating procedures of the Medical Examiner.
(8)

Photographs, radiographs, and histology slides.

(9)

Charge to non-county owned hospitals for the acceptance of fetal remains
not falling under the jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner.

(10)

Confirmation of death letter.

(11)

Tissue procurement morgue use fee. Fee charged to a certified facility or
program seeking to procure tissue from bodies located at the Medical
Examiner's Office. The fee covers tissue procurement per body by a tissue
procurement facility or program authorized by the Medical Examiner.

(12)

Student rotation fee. Fee charged to institutions providing student
rotations at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset the County's costs for
disposable supplies as well as the staff time supervising the student
rotation.

(13)

Staff supervision of external experts. Fee charged to individuals
requesting to review slides, images and/or records at the Medical
Examiner's Office to offset staff costs for supervising such review.

(14)

Toxicology send out fees. Fee charged for processing, packaging and
shipping specimens to reference labs at the request of the decedent's next
of kin for testing.

(15)

Lab use fee. Fee charged to institutions authorized by the Medical
Examiner and County Board to use the Medical Examiner’s Office and
supplies for teaching purposes.

Expert witness fees. Fees will be charged to attorneys for expert
consultation and trial/deposition time for the Chief Medical Examiner,

Toxicologists as well as their travel time and case review time for Medical
Examiner cases leading to civil litigation. Such fees will not apply to

electronic and forensic identification equipment or other related supplies and operating

detailed record of such requests for verification of notifications, the date and time of
notification, the name and contact information of the next-of-kin, and the date and time of
the receipt of the body. In the event that the appropriate law enforcement authority is
unable to locate the next of kin within 48 72 hours of the body arriving at the Medical
Examiner's Office, the Medical Examiner's Office shall obtain verification that the next of
kin cannot be initially located but shall continue to work with the investigating agency to

Examiner's Office, the Medical Examiner's Office may seek the assistance of the Chicago
Police Department, Cook County Sheriff's Office., Public Administrator, or any other
relevant agency and will keep a log of identification efforts.
Sec. 38-142. Retention of an identified decedent.
(a)
Where the Medical Examiner has no legal reason for retaining a body and
no person(s) can or will take responsibility for the final disposition of the decedent, the
Medical Examiner shall have the authority to properly dispose of a body through burial or
cremation within 60 days of notifying the next of kin (if known), unless there is reason to
believe that the deceased may be a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. Where the Medical

Medical Examiner shall provide a written report to the Advisory Committee and to the
Board of Commissioners stating the reason for retention. The Medical Examiner shall
report to the Cook County Board on this matter quarterly.
(d)
An identified body will be considered potentially “indigent” (either
unclaimed or disclaimed) if, after fourteen days, there are no apparent funds for burial. At

practical provided that there are no funds for burial, the next-of-kin has refused to take
responsibility for final disposition of the remains, and that the decedent is not entitled to

A member of the medical profession,

(2)

A clergyperson,

(3)

A funeral director,

(4)

An attorney from the Cook County State's Attorney Office,

(5)

A Commissioner representing the people of Cook County,

(6)

A member of the Chicago Police Department,

(7)

A representative from the Cook County Sheriff's Office, and

(8)

A member of the public.

(b)

The members of this committee shall serve without pay.

131

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

(c)
The members of this committee shall attend meetings to be held at the Medical
Examiner’s Office on a quarterly basis, beginning with the third quarter of the fiscal year in which this
Ordinance is enacted.
(d)
The committee shall prepare an annual report. The report shall be distributed to the

year. The report shall include minutes of meetings of the Advisory Committee over the past year,
including a list of attendees at each meeting, and recommendations for improving operations of the

shall provide administrative support as necessary.
(e)
The members of the committee shall have a fiduciary responsibility to protect the dignity
of the deceased that are brought into the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office.
Sec. 38-133.

Any person, individual, partnership, corporation, firm, company, trust, estate, political
subdivision, state agency, or any other legal entity who causes the death of a decedent by a wrongful act,
carelessness, or negligence which shall be subject to a Medical Examiner’s investigation shall be liable to
pay any and all expenses incurred by such investigation and the associated burial expenses. The same
shall be recoverable by the county.
Sec. 38-134.

Transportation costs.

All transportation costs of the body incident to the Medical Examiner's investigation shall be
recoverable from the estate of the deceased. The Medical Examiner shall have no responsibility or
obligation to arrange for transportation of bodies to the Medical Examiner’s facility.
Sec. 38-135.

Fees.

The Medical Examiner shall charge the following fees with the amounts as set in Section 32-1 of
this Code.
(1)

Autopsy report.

(2)

Toxicology report.

(3)

Miscellaneous reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police reports.

(4)

Permit to cremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the Medical Examiner,
by facsimile or electronic filing.

(5)

Return fee. The Return Fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the
Medical Examiner’s Office and then request to return them to the Office after
determining that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of
the burial shell and the burial cost.

(6)

Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than one
year of the person’s death (due to a return by Funeral Home). The Office of the Medical

132

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for amendments made
to a death certificate after one year of the death.
(7)

Storage fee. This fee covers bodies returned (by funeral homes) to the Office of the
Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services and bodies
brought to the Medical Examiner’s Office from hospice, nursing homes, and hospitals
for cases not falling under Medical Examiner jurisdiction as defined in Sec, 38-118. The
ability to accept cases for storage will be at the discretion of the Medical Examiner and
will depend on the current and anticipated morgue census. This “storage fee”
discourages the use of the Office of the Medical Examiner as a storage location for nonMedical Examiner cases or cases that have been discharged from the Medical Examiner’s
Office to funeral homes and encourages funeral directors to verify that families have
funds for burial prior to removing a body from the Office of the Medical Examiner. In
the cases of funeral homes, this “storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral
home returns a body and picks it up again within ten days. If the body is not picked up
within ten days, the body will be held and buried by the County according to the standard
operating procedures of the Medical Examiner.

(8)

Photographs, radiographs, and histology slides.

(9)

Charge to non-county owned hospitals for the acceptance of fetal remains not falling
under the jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner.

(10)

Confirmation of death letter.

(11)

Tissue procurement morgue use fee. Fee charged to a certified facility or program
seeking to procure tissue from bodies located at the Medical Examiner's Office. The fee
covers tissue procurement per body by a tissue procurement facility or program
authorized by the Medical Examiner.

(12)

Student rotation fee. Fee charged to institutions providing student rotations at the
Medical Examiner's Office to offset the County's costs for disposable supplies as well as
the staff time supervising the student rotation.

(13)

Staff supervision of external experts. Fee charged to individuals requesting to review
slides, images and/or records at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset staff costs for
supervising such review.

(14)

Toxicology send out fees. Fee charged for processing, packaging and shipping
specimens to reference labs at the request of the decedent's next of kin for testing.

(15)

Lab use fee. Fee charged to institutions authorized by the Medical Examiner and County
Board to use the Medical Examiner’s Office and supplies for teaching purposes.

(16)

Expert witness fees. Fees will be charged to attorneys for expert consultation and
trial/deposition time for the Chief Medical Examiner, Assistant Chief Medical Examiner
Assistant Medical Examiners, and Toxicologists as well as their travel time and case
review time for Medical Examiner cases leading to civil litigation. Such fees will not
apply to criminal proceedings related to Medical Examiner cases.

of the various fees of the Office of the Medical Examiner received on or after December 1, 2012 shall be
transferred or deposited into the County’s general fund and placed into an account designated for use by
the Office of the Medical Examiner as noted by the Budget Director. All of the various fees collected by
the Office of the Medical Examiner will continue to be used solely for the purchase of electronic and

Notice of possession of an identified body.

(a)
Whenever the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office takes possession of an identified
body or the remains of a body the Medical Examiner's Office is hereby required to request verification
from the investigating police agency that the decedent's next of kin has been notified that the body is in
the possession of the Medical Examiner's Office. The Medical Examiner's Office shall keep a detailed
record of such requests for verification of notifications, the date and time of notification, the name and
contact information of the next-of-kin, and the date and time of the receipt of the body. In the event that

arriving at the Medical Examiner's Office, the Medical Examiner's Office shall obtain verification that the
next of kin cannot be initially located but shall continue to work with the investigating agency to verify
notification of next-of-kin and shall log these efforts. The Medical Examiner's Office shall retain such
records in the case file for a period of at least two years. As described in Section 38-125 all personal
possessions of the decedent shall be recorded.
(b)
In the event the Medical Examiner's Office cannot obtain verification that next of kin has
been notified that the decedent's body is in the possession of the Medical Examiner's Office, the Medical

134

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

Examiner's Office may seek the assistance of the Chicago Police Department, Cook County Sheriff's
Office, Public Administrator, or any other relevant agency and will keep a log of identification efforts.
Sec. 38-142.

Retention of an identified decedent.

(a)
Where the Medical Examiner has no legal reason for retaining a body and no person(s)
can or will take responsibility for the final disposition of the decedent, the Medical Examiner shall have
the authority to properly dispose of a body through burial or cremation within 60 days of notifying the
next of kin (if known), unless there is reason to believe that the deceased may be a veteran of the U.S.
Armed Forces. Where the Medical Examiner's Office has reason to believe that the decedent may be a
veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Medical Examiner's Office shall have up to 90 days to properly
dispose of the body.
(b)
The Medical Examiner's Office is hereby authorized to seek certification from the
decedent’s next of kin (if known) that the decedent is not a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the event
that such certification is obtained and the next of kin cannot or will not assume responsibility for final
disposition, the Medical Examiner's Office shall properly dispose of the body within 60days.

Notwithstanding other provisions in this section, if the Medical Examiner determines that
an identified body needs to be retained longer than permitted then the Medical Examiner shall provide a
written report to the Advisory Committee and to the Board of Commissioners stating the reason for
retention. The Medical Examiner shall report to the Cook County Board on this matter quarterly.
(d)
An identified body will be considered potentially “indigent” (either unclaimed or
disclaimed) if, after fourteen days, there are no apparent funds for burial. At that point the body will be
eligible for donation or educational purposes in accordance with the Illinois Compiled Statutes 410 ILCS
510 Cadaver Act. Prior to releasing the body for donation or educational purposes, an additional three
days will be spent notifying the next-of-kin (if known), attempting to verify and locate next-of-kin (if not
known) and confirming that the decedent is not eligible for a non-County funded burial or VA benefits.
(e)
Indigent remains will be buried or cremated at County expense as soon as practical
provided that there are no funds for burial, the next-of-kin has refused to take responsibility for final
disposition of the remains, and that the decedent is not entitled to burial through non-County funds or VA
benefits.
(f)
Unidentified remains will be buried once all reasonable investigative and scientific
efforts have been made to identify the body. Unidentified remains will not be cremated.
Sec. 38-143.

Decedents disposed at public expense.

(a)
Indigent Decedents. If a decedent’s next of kin is financially unable to cover the costs
related to final disposition, the decedent may be buried or cremated at public expense. To qualify for final
disposition at public expense, both the decedent and the person legally responsible for the disposition of
the remains must be legally indigent and not eligible to receive any funds to cover the cost of the burial
from any federal or state source, e.g., Veterans Assistance, Public Aid. Any decedent in the custody of the
Office of the Medical Examiner who has not been claimed by the decedent’s next of kin or known
personal representative, if any, within 14 days shall be subject to final disposition by the Medical
Examiner by any means authorized by this Chapter 38. An additional three days will be taken to contact
the next of kin, if known, and other appropriate agencies to determine whether alternative burial funds are

through 2-336, the Litigation Subcommittee may delay or deny the payment of any accrued
or future fees and costs for the matter of representation.
(b)
An attorney who files an appearance without being appointed as a Special

appointed by a court or the State’s Attorney. The Litigation Subcommittee may refuse to
deny the payment of any accrued fees prior to the appointment.

BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATION
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 21, 2013 from
CARL R. BYRD, Acting Chief Administrative Officer
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute Contract No. 13-8412815 with Konica Minolta Business Solutions U.S.A., Inc., Ramsey, New Jersey, for the leasing of 325
multifunction photocopiers on a cost per copy basis. All County departments participate in the
photocopier leasing program. The following offices will be receiving equipment from this contract:
Office of the Chief Judge, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Office of the Sheriff, Forest Preserve District of
Cook County, and various offices under the President. All equipment will be capable of network printing,
faxing and scanning. Cost per copy includes the use of the equipment, maintenance services and all
supplies (excluding paper).
Reason:

Four (4) bids were received and opened on August 9, 2013. Konica Minolta Business
Solutions U.S.A., Inc. was the lowest, qualified bidder meeting specifications. It has been
determined that leasing of multifunction photocopier equipment saves the County an average
of $1,000,000.00 annually versus purchasing and maintaining the same equipment.
Additionally, photocopier leasing contracts allow the County to keep up with technology by
replacing the equipment every five (5) years. Finally, multifunction photocopier equipment
allows departments to eliminate stand alone printers and fax machines which reduce capital,
maintenance and supply costs.

194

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

This contract will replace an existing multifunction photocopier contract which will expire on
November 1, 2013. The new contract has a savings of $224,616.00 from the previous
contract.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $2,083,024.00 (FY 2013: $34,717.00; FY 2014: $416,604.00; FY 2015:
$416,604.00; FY 2016: $416,604.00; FY 2017: $416,604.00; and FY 2018: $381,891.00). Contract
period: November 2, 2013 through November 1, 2018. (490-630 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 funds.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY
AGREEMENT
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHN COOKE, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
I hereby transmit for your approval a request for the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized
by the Cook County Chief Procurement Officer, to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract
(JOC) program to complete the three (3) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based
procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and
construction projects with a single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first
selecting a pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying
projects for such selected contractors.
Reason:

The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created
the pool of general contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with
maintenance, repairs, and routine work. Participating in the County’s existing JOC contract,
would allow the County to enjoy the myriad cost savings achieved through volume purchases.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The
Gordian Group maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific
construction work items within this region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in
the price book. The cost, therefore, of any work performed by the contractor is a contractor
markup from the price book. The Gordian Group would receive a 5 % administrative fee from
Cook County based on the total project cost of the work.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, request authorization for the Chief Procurement
Officer, to:

196

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

a.

Enter into and execute an agreement with the Gordian Group on the same terms as, and
actively participate in the County’s JOC agreement for the coordination and
administrative management of the JOC program.

b.

Do all such acts and things and to execute all contracts necessary to complete the Projects
using vendors selected through the County’s JOC program.

c.

The following projects would be included and assigned by the Gordian Group to
participating JOC contractors:
1. Oak Forest UPS System
2. Oak Forest Condensing Unit
3. DOC Central Kitchen Condensing Units

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,250,000.00.
20000 County Physical Plant and 33000 Oak Forest Hospital.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the Chief Procurement Officer be
authorized to enter into the requested agreement. The motion carried unanimously.
PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHN COOKE, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting approval and execution of an intergovernmental agreement between the County of Cook, a
body politic and corporate of the State of Illinois, on behalf of the Office of Capital Planning and Policy
(OCPP) and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS), and the Illinois Medical District
Commission (IMDC), a body politic and corporate and unit of local government of the State of Illinois.
Per Article VII, Section 10 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act
(5 ILCS 220/1 et seq.), and other applicable law, units of local government are permitted to cooperate
with and support each other in exercise of their authority and the performance of their responsibilities.
The purpose of the proposed Intergovernmental Agreement (“Agreement”) will be to allow the IMDC,
OCPP and CCHHS to collaborate on redevelopment opportunities within the Illinois Medical District, to
better account for existing and future needs of the County and CCHHS as well as the IMDC, including
but not limited to the best and highest uses for the County, CCHHS and IMDC properties within the
Illinois Medical District.
The Agreement will also promote quality comprehensive re-development opportunities for the County,
CCHHS and the IMDC within the Illinois Medical District. The Agreement between the County and the
IMDC allows for the exploration of redevelopment opportunities and will allow the parties to determine
strategies to enhance the services provided to the medical district community, develop a vibrant mixeduse campus for CCHHS and the surrounding IMDC community, and benefit the overall medical district
community.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

(2) years thereafter. This Agreement may be extended or amended upon the mutual written agreement of
the parties. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing the other party with
thirty (30) days prior written notice of such termination.

in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On July 16, 2013 is when it became apparent that the account mentioned above would need an
infusion of funds because the balance of funds was insufficient to meet our needs for the remainder
of the fiscal year.

333 - $270,994.00

The current balance of this account is as follows:

333 - $40,446.00

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The accounts for the source of transferred funds were identified because of the amount of
unencumbered funds
No other accounts were considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account was chosen because of the unobligated surplus in contract maintenance and repair
building and institutional equipment.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 22, 2013 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $65,000.00 from Account
310-225, Postage to Account 300-260, Professional and Managerial Services to supplement the budget for
court-ordered, hearing-impaired sign language interpreter services.
Reason:

There has been an unforeseen rise in FY 2013 in the use of sign language interpreters in court
proceedings. Additional funds are needed due to the significant increase in both interpreter
appearances and the vendor service rates. Courts are required to provide these services to the
deaf and hard of hearing pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/8-1402 and the Americans with Disabilities
Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101, et seq.

From Account 310-225

Total

$65,000.00

To Account 300-260

Total

$65,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
Shortly after the four-month period ended March 31, 2013, it became evident that the Circuit
Court’s budget for hearing-impaired sign language services would be insufficient to keep pace with
the legislatively mandated requirement to provide services for the deaf and hard of hearing.
Billings from the court’s primary vendor through that date totaled more than $38,000.00, compared
to the adjusted 2013 annual budget of $49,470.00. Through February 2013, billings totaled about
$21,700.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The postage account was identified after a detailed review of expenditure forecasts.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 310-225.
The reduction in the Circuit Court's postage account 310-225 will cause no deferrals, delays or
cancellations.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

253

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

The court’s postage account is used mainly for petit juror summons mailings. The court had
budgeted for an equal number of mailings in FY 2013 as in FY 2012, because the number of case
filings have stabilized in recent years. To date in FY 2013, however, the mailings have declined
approximately ten percent from the previous fiscal year.
The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.

JUVENILE PROBATION AND COURT SERVICES DEPARTMENT
CONTRACT
The following item was deferred at the July 31, 2013 Board Meeting:
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 17, 2013 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
and
SHANNON E. ANDREWS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with Aunt
Martha's Youth Service Center, Inc. (Aunt Martha’s), Olympia Fields, Illinois, for the Juvenile Probation
and Court Services Department’s Evening Reporting Centers Program and pre-trial services.
Reason:

Aunt Martha's is recommended based upon a Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 13-23001. Aunt Martha's was the only vendor to respond to the RFP.
The Evening Reporting Centers Program combines community-based alternative detention
sites with electronic monitoring. Judges order selected, nonviolent minors, both male and
female, who would otherwise qualify for detention in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center (JTDC) to one of six centers. Approximately 40 percent of the minors
subject to probation pretrial supervision are ordered to the program for up to 21 days. The
Centers provide minors with highly structured and well supervised group activities during
high risk periods. The program's goal is to reduce the likelihood of re-arrest and to allow
minors to continue to attend school and remain at home. Juveniles are supervised five (5)
days per week from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. in five (5) Chicago locations and one (1) suburban
location. Staff members offer minors educational activities, recreational programming and
life development workshops. Center staff also teach social/life skills to reinforce pro-social
behaviors and provide tutoring support for school work. The centers provide transportation
for the minors to and from home. In calendar 2012, more than 1,850 minors were admitted,
for a total of more than 15,100 center service days.
In addition to the Evening Reporting Centers Program, the contract provides for pretrial

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

256

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

On August 2, 2013 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet FY 2013 obligations for biohazardous waste disposal. The balance on the account
was $2,585.00, and the balance 30 days prior was $2,921.00
On August 13, 2013 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet FY 2013obligations for the laundry and linen service here at the Medical
Examiner’s office. The balance on the account was at $740.00, and the balance 30 days prior was
still at $740.00.
On August 13, 2013 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet FY 2013 obligations for professional and managerial services. The balance
on this account was $27,394.00, and the balance 30 days prior was at $2,621.00.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The 235 - Contractual Maintenance Services account had an unencumbered balance of more than
$50,000.00 and all remaining FY 2013 expenditures were considered.
The 353 - Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services account had an
unencumbered balance of more than $20,000.00 in which all FY 2013 expenditures have been
considered.
The 367 - X-ray (Radiology) Supplies account had an unencumbered balance of more than
$30,000.00 in which all FY 2013 expenditures have been considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
The 353 account for Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services purchases will be
delayed until the FY 2014 budget. This delay of funds does not allow the library at the Medical
Examiner’s office to obtain needed library resources, books and periodicals for the doctors.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
235 - Contractual Maintenance Services. Due to a new janitorial services contract which was
budgeted at a much higher amount, the contract was approximately 5% lower than expected.
Snow removal is under this account, and due to the mild winter last year, enough funds have
remained on the purchase order. All other contracts under the 235 account have already
encumbered enough funds for FY 2013.
The 367 - X-ray (Radiology) Supplies account had budgeted a much higher amount for the service
agreement for the x-ray table. This contract was being procured during budget preparations, so it
was overestimated before the contract was complete.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $44,460.00 from Account
016-110, Salaries and Wages of Regular Employees to Account 016-298, Special or Cooperative
Programs.
Reason:

Transfer of funds needed to support a summer internship program which will place youth

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 16, 2013, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds.
The balance in the account at that time was $0, and the balance 30 days prior to that was $0. The
account was not budgeted for FY 2013, as this program was not expected to be implemented in
2013.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 016-110 was identified as the source of transferred funds since there was the availability of
funds resulting from hiring delays in vacancies. No other accounts were considered for as the
source of the transferred funds.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 016-110.
This transfer request will not defer, delay or cancel hiring as the hiring of vacancies are expected to
occur during the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2013.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

RESOLUTION
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 12, 2013 from
ANNA ASHCRAFT, Director, Real Estate Management Division
requesting authorization to have certain County- owned property identified as EL#438 declared as
“excess” by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County and to convey the property by Quit Claim Deed
to the Forest Preserve District of Cook County. The subject property consists of approximately + 4.814
acre in Cook County District #6, is located in that part of the West Half of the Southwest Quarter of
Section 25 along Interstate Highway 80/94 from WB I-80 to NB I-394 (NE quadrant) at Volbrecht Road,
in Thornton Township, Cook County Illinois.
The Real Estate is not needed for County purposes. The parcel cannot be developed or used for roadway
purposes due to the location of Thorn Creek, which passes through the parcel, and the physical
characteristics of the parcel. The Forest Preserve District owns land adjacent to and north of this parcel
and proposes to obtain title to the parcel and utilize it for trail purposes. The Real Estate Management
Division recommends conveyance of this parcel to the Forest Preserve District at no cost, as such use will
serve the interests of the public.
Therefore, it is requested that this Honorable Body declare the subject property to be “excess” and
authorize the conveyance of the property by approval of the Resolution attached hereto.

one, full-time Child Sexual Abuse Specialist funded by this grant focuses on providing victim services
including crisis intervention with victims and families of victims, identifying and making referrals for
immediate and long-term counseling services, monitoring and coordinating services for children who are
wards of the state and working with the local and state agencies involved with the victim as well as
working directly with local and state law enforcement and service agencies to provide training, technical
assistance and consultation. The estimated fiscal impact is the remaining salary and fringe benefits of the
Child Sexual Abuse Specialist that would not be covered by the anticipated grant awards from the Illinois
Attorney General’s Office and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.
The authorization to accept the previous grant award was given on July 24, 2012 by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners in the amount of $37,932.00 with a cash match in the amount of $32,142.00.

ANITA ALVAREZ, Cook County State’s Attorney
by
RAYMOND BALCARCEL, Chief Financial Officer, Office of the State’s Attorney

274

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 11, 2013

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $90,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below.
Reason:

This transfer of funds, which represents less than one-tenth of one percent of our 2013
budget, should be sufficient to fulfill our obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year for
three accounts with projected shortages. These accounts are: 225 Postage, where we have
seen an increase in certified mailings; 388 Computer Operation Supplies, mainly due to the
high number of CD and DVD storage disks for video interrogations and the related
discoveries, as well as the increasing cost of printer toner; and 444 Maintenance and Repair
of Automotive Equipment, where the expiration of warrantees on a large portion of our fleet
has resulted in repair costs slightly higher than anticipated.

30,000.00

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On June 1, Account 225 had a balance of approximately $46,000.00; on May 1 the balance was
$86,000.00.
On July 1, Account 388 had a balance of only $4,000.00; on June 1 the balance was $25,000.00.
The balance in Account 444 has been depleted for most of the year, since almost all of the funding
each year is encumbered early as Purchase Orders (POs) are issued to various vendors in
accordance with the annual county wide contracts for automotive repair. At the beginning of July
we realized that the remaining balances in these POs might not be sufficient, and that a transfer was
advisable.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
These were the accounts, based on current year to date spending and known obligations, which
were projected as most likely to have remaining balances at year end.

Although spending fluctuates from year to year in many accounts, our original budget requests were
based on our best estimates at the time.

accounts listed below.
Reason:

Account 246 is used to pay for subpoenaed documents required for trial, primarily medical
and bank records. We have recently experienced a significant increase in bills for hospital
records of the victims in criminal cases, particularly in our Juvenile Justice Bureau, where
every case of alleged abuse or neglect of a minor requires the acquisition of full medical
