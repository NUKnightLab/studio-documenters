I.

Approval of SSA 54 Budget and Workplan
• Lengthy discussion on the 2015 budget and workplan. Jennifer Clark raised questions about the budget
admin costs and RPBA’s role. Several commissioners commented that it looked like RPBA was receiving a
larger percentage than in the past and what would be feasible to lower those costs. Sandi explained the
difference between ‘carry over’ and ‘late collections’; she also explained that RPBA allocated more of
the district managers time to this SSA than in prior years which accounted for the increase in admin
costs.
• Motion to approve the 2015 SSA54 Budget and Workplan and to name Rogers Park Business Alliance as
sole service provider. (Clark/Connelly). Unanimously approved
