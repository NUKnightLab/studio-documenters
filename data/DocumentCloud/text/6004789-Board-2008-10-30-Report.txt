Update on discussions with consulting ?rms

a meeting was recently held with a consulting ?rm, Alvarez and Marsal. They are already doing small projects
with David Small, Interim Chief Executive Of?cer and Pitt Calkin, Interim Chief Financial Of?cer of the Cook

for this purpose; hopefully this can be processed by December 1St or shortly thereafter.

Discussion continued on the subject. Chairman Batts stated that when the proposals are received, the Board
should select the best two proposals for discussion and review. There are two approaches that could be taken by
the consulting ?rm they could bring in an entire team to manage, or they could bring in a small senior group to
work with existing staff. Questions were raised with regard to funding; Mr. Small responded that funding for
this has been requested in the 2009 budget.

Update on Fiscal Year 2009 Budget

Chairman Batts provided an update on the ?scal year 2009 budget. He stated that there were adjustments made
by the County which changed the original budget document; the amount requested by the System has increased
to $47 million. The budget was submitted to the President and was then submitted to the County?s Finance
Committee. The Commissioners have a deadline of November 5th to submit amendments, and are scheduled to
vote on the preliminary budget in the Finance Committee on November 7th. It would then be sent to be included

the Human Resources Committee; discussion is needed at the human resources level on how this will ?t in with
the leadership team at the System. Additionally, she stated that a job description is needed for this position after

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) seems to be favorably disposed to the amendment, it is

Procurement Issues with County

Mr. Small reported that for the last several months there have been ongoing disconnects with the County
interface on procurement issues. There have been dif?culties with processing of Board-approved items they are
also running into issues of getting payment on items. In order to try to work out the problems, Leslie Duffy,
Director of Procurement of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, has met with the following
individuals: Donna Dunnings, Cook County Chief Financial Of?cer; Joseph Fratto, Chief of Staff to President
Todd H. Stroger; and Carmen Triche-Colvin, Cook County Purchasing Agent. Some of the issues were relative
to communication confusion in the transition to Cook County Health and Hospital System Board authority.
Assurances have been made that best efforts are underway to rectify the problems. Additionally, Mr. Small
informed the Board that two senior buyers from the County?s Purchasing Department were re-deployed to the
System to assist and train people on how to carry out the functions.

Mr. Small stated that there is still some confusion on which payments should still be submitted to the County
Board for their approval. Some are still appearing upon the bills and claims section for the County Board?s
approval; efforts are underway to address this subject.

In response to a question from Director Mu?oz with regard to the timeline for the rollout of the System?s
procurement policies and procedures, Mr. Small stated that they are working with the State?s Attomey?s Of?ce
to develop their own internal procurement policy. They are seeking to take over many procurement functions
from the County; several positions have been placed into the 2009 budget for this purpose.

Miscellaneous
'Mr. Small reported that there was some confusion recently with regard to letterhead for the System.

Speci?cally, there was a question raised of whether the Board was going to change names of facilities. He
stated that there is no intent by this Board to rename any facility in the System.
