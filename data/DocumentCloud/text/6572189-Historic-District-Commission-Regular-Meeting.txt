Product Description
The LRWB is a low-profile forced draft closed circuit cooler with a centrifugal fan. The ideal application for
this type of closed circuit cooler is any environment with strict height or sound constraints; it is also an
effective solution for designs incorporating indoor installation that require ducting. The LRWB utilizes
EVAPCOâs Thermal-PakÂ® Coil, featuring CrossCoolâ¢ Internal Tube Enhancement, which increases the
cooling capacity of the unit. The LRWB is designed for ease of maintenance and extended trouble-free
operation. Units come standard with CTI certified performance and IBC Compliant construction. The
standard construction of the LRWB contains a 304 stainless steel pan as standard.

neutral 75Â°F (adjustable discharge air set-point). In cooling mode,
the DX coil will cool the air to the discharge air set-point (adjustable). In heating mode, the heating section will heat the air to the
discharge air set-point (adjustable). Supply fan will run continuously during occupied mode and fan will turn off in unoccupied mode.

DOAS units are run tested prior to shipment from the factory. Factory
run test report can be provided at the request of engineer, contractor, or owner. Factory run test includes a dielectric (hipot) test. All
motorized dampers are cycled on full stroke while installed in the
unit using the factory provided motorized damper actuators. The
following tests are performed:
â¢ Supply fan is visually inspected during ramp-up and ramp-down.
Fan rotation direction is checked. Fan pressure proving switch
operation is checked.
â¢ Exhaust fan is visually inspected during ramp-up and ramp-down.
Fan rotation direction is checked. Fan pressure proving switch
operation is checked.
â¢ Energy recovery wheel is visually inspected to be free to rotate
within the cassette. Belt drive mechanism is visually inspected.
Energy recovery wheel is enabled to ensure proper rotation.
â¢ Indirect gas furnace is run tested while installed inside the unit with
8.5 inches wg pressure natural gas. Leaving air temperature (LAT)
and manifold pressure is measured and recorded at minimum /
maximum fire.
â¢ Condensing fans are inspected to rotate freely without obstruction
and for proper rotation. Amount of current drawn by each condensing fan is measured and recorded.
â¢ Refrigeration system sub-cooling and superheat are measured
after fifteen (15) minutes of steady-state operation with hot gas
reheat valve fully closed (0%). Refrigeration system sub-cooling
and superheat are measured after fifteen (15) minutes of steadystate operation with hot gas reheat valve fully open (100%). If the
unit has a second refrigerant circuit, that circuitâs sub-cooling and
superheat are measured after fifteen (15) minutes of steady-state
operation.

â¢ (Optional) Discharge air control with space temperature and humidity sensors â Similar to Discharge air control, but includes wall
humidity and temperature sensors for display purposes only.

SELECTION PROCESS

Selection Process

Rooftop Dedicated Outdoor Air System Engineering Manual

LG CAPS software will be available for selecting the proper rooftop DOAS unit. (LG CAPS will be available at www.myLGHVAC.com in Spring
2017, or contact your local LG sales representative.) If LG CAPS software is not yet available and you need help in sizing the Rooftop DOAS
unit, please contact your local LG representative. The designer will need to know the following items to properly size rooftop DOAS unit:
â¢ Entering air dry bulb (DB) and wet bulb (WB) temperatures for cooling (Â°F)
â¢ Entering air DB temperature for heating (Â°F)
â¢ Airflow rate (CFM)
â¢ Airflow external static pressure (in. wg)
â¢ Direct expansion (DX) coil leaving air temperature (LAT) (Â°F)
â¢ Unit LAT in cooling and heating modes (Â°F)
Regional outdoor design temperatures are varied across the United States market, and it is important to input the appropriate outdoor design
temperatures in the LG CAPS selection software. Over-sizing or under-sizing the DOAS unit capacity may result in discharge air temperatures that do not meet set-point. By entering both the DB and WB outdoor cooling design temperatures, the compressors and coils can be
accurately sized to dehumidify the outdoor air. The DX coil leaving air temperature for dehumidification mode is commonly selected at 55Â°F
to help remove the moisture from the air. The General Data tables on pages 9 to 12 are based on 55Â°F DX coil LATs, but some regions
require different LATs.
The tables on the following pages were generated at 50Â°F, 55Â°F, and 60Â°F LATs, and at the following entering air temperatures (EATs):
â¢ 84Â°F DB / 70Â°F WB
â¢ 95Â°F DB / 75Â°F WB
â¢ 95Â°F DB / 78Â°F WB
â¢ 95Â°F DB / 80Â°F WB
Airflow capacities at other temperatures not shown in the tables can be generated using the LG CAPS selection software. These tables were
generated for a quick reference to illustrate the effects of various EATs, and various DX coil LATs.
