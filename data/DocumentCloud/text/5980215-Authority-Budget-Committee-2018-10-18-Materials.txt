I. Minutes of the August 14, 2018, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the minutes of the August 14, 2018, Budget
Committee Meeting. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
II. Bullying Prevention
ICJIA Program Supervisor Shai Hoffman referred to a memo dated September 4, 2018,
drafted for informational purposes on ICJIA’s appropriation for Bullying Prevention
(BP). He said ICJIA received a state appropriation of $443,000 in the state fiscal year
2019to support BP. He said staff recommended using BP funds to support one or more
grants to Illinois HEALS (Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems) pilot locations to

3

 9/4/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 3

support trauma-aware schools. He said staff wanted to expend the funds by June 30,
2019, which left little time for a proper competitive bidding process.
ICJIA Strategic Policy Advisor & Project Director Reshma Desai said that the Illinois
HEALS program was started with a discretionary grant that Illinois received from the
federal Office for Victims of Crime. The program seeks to improve the identification of
youths who are victims of violence and to improve the coordination of care. Staff is
conducting an assessment planning process to identify community sites for the program.
Mr. Hoffman said staff would request BP designations at a future Budget Committee
meeting. He said that it would not be necessary to release a Notice of Funding
Opportunity and proceed with the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act’s
competitive funding award process if the Grant Accountability and Transparency Unit
grants ICJIA an exemption for this program.
No action was taken.
III. Justice Assistance Grants FFY13, FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16
ICJIA Federal & State Grants Unit Acting Associate Director Stevens referred Budget
Committee members to a memo dated September 4, 2018, regarding FFY13, FFY14,
FFY15, and FFY16 Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) plans.
A. Designation Reduction
Mr. Stevens described $161,095 in FFY14, $37,816 in FFY15, and $4,152 in FFY16
JAG funds recently returned to ICJIA. He said the FFY14 funds will expire on
September 30, 2018, and were no longer available for programming. He said staff
recommended making the returned FFY15 and FFY16 funds available for other
programming.
Motion: Ms. Vollen-Katz moved to approve the recommended JAG FFY14, FFY15, and
FFY16 designation reductions. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Hon. Robb.
B. Fund Reallocations
Mr. Stevens discussed a staff recommendation to terminate FFY14 funding for four
programs on September 30, 2018, and replace the funding with FFY16 dollars to
support the remainders of those programs as described in the memo. He said the Office
of Justice Programs unexpectedly announced that FFY14 funds will expire on
September 30, 2018. He said staff requested additional funds to support continuation of
the City of Springfield’s Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime program. He said
the continuation would reduce the administrative burdens associated with executing two
separate grant agreements.

$208,200

Mr. Stevens said the funds would allow the municipalities to purchase an acquisition
station, an analysis station, and a Stereo Zoom Microscope that would allow them to
utilize National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) technology.
Deputy Chief David Shaffer of City of Champaign Police Department said local access to
NIBIN technology would dramatically reduce the time it takes to produce ballistics test
results and that the equipment would be shared with other law enforcement agencies.
Motion: Hon. Robb moved to approve the recommended FFY13 JAG designation
recommendations to support purchases of mobile ballistic test equipment. Mr. Kocerka
seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
3. Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program

Enforcement Response to Narcotics programs. He said the designations would support
grants for six months from October 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019. The shorter, six-month
designations were recommended due to the delay in the state’s receipt of its FFY17 JAG
award.
Motion: Mr. Olson moved to approve the recommended FFY13, FFY15, and FFY16
JAG designation recommendations to continue support of the Comprehensive Law
Enforcement Response to Narcotics programs for a period of six months. Hon. Robb

MEMORANDUM
TO:

Budget Committee Members

FROM:

Greg Stevens, Acting Associate Director, Federal & State Grants Unit

Date:

October 18, 2018

RE:

Federal Fiscal Year 2013 Justice Assistance Grants Plan Adjustment

A. DESIGNATION REDUCTIONS
1. Returned Funds
The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office recently returned $14,219 from its FFY16
designation supporting its Human Trafficking Task force due to personnel, supplies, and
travel costs being less than expected. Staff recommends making these funds available for
future programming.
2. Designation Adjustment
On September 4, 2018, the Budget Committee reduced a FFY14 designation to the City
of Springfield for its Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime Program from
$197,313 to $148,909. This was done because a recent rule change by the Office of
Justice Programs (OJP) forced FFY14 funds to expire on September 30, 2018, causing
Springfield’s grant to end two months and 12 days early. The pro-rated balance of the
original designation, $48,404, was included in a new FFY16 designation of $146,933 to
support the program through June 12, 2019. Staff has since discovered an accounting
error; the original FFY14 designation should have been reduced to $130,590 and the new
FFY16 continuation designation should have been for $145,765. Staff recommends
adjusting these designations accordingly.
B. RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
At its August 18, 2017, and September 16, 2017, meetings, the Budget Committee
designated funding to four jurisdictions selected through the competitive Partnerships and
Strategies to Reduce Violent Crime Request for Proposals. The Year One designations
supported research-informed planning to identify the drivers of violent crime in each
jurisdiction through the formation of local multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) and the use
of community surveys, the Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment (SARA)
process, and other analytical tools.

Staff recommends following designations to these jurisdictions to complete the planning
initiatives and begin implementation of focused deterrence strategies that closely target
offenders at highest risk of reoffending, offering social supports and imposing swift,
certain, and fair sanctions for non-compliance. These designations support ongoing
research partner contracts, as well as salaries for local program coordinators and
community-based program navigators who facilitate offender call-in meetings and foster
offender participation.
The recommended designations include:

Planning (RMAP)

RE:

FFY17 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Plan Adjustment

RSAT FFY17 INTRODUCTION
To comply with the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA), ICJIA issued a Notice
of Funding Opportunity in May 2017 to solicit applications for state and local correctional
treatment and aftercare services to be supported with FFY17 RSAT funds and local-use funds
remaining from the FFY14, FFY15 and FFY16 RSAT awards. The notice detailed federal RSAT
requirements and model RSAT programs and best practices.
At its July 27, 2017, meeting, as a result of the NOFO, the Budget Committee designated
funding to two correctional facilities. The Year One designations supported efforts of these
facilities to provide residential substance abuse treatment and aftercare services for inmates.
IJCIA demonstrated efforts to make RSAT funds available to local program and the U.S.
Department of Justice approved grant adjustments that removed the local set-aside requirement
for the FFY14, FFY15, FFY16, and FFY17 RSAT awards. These adjustments give ICJIA the
ability to use the local set-aside funds to support programs at state agencies.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATION
Four applications were received in response to the May 2017 RSAT Notice of Funding
Opportunity. The applications were scored by a team of ICJIA grant and research staff, following
ICJIA’s GATA-compliant, merit-based review process. Two of the four met the minimum
scoring threshold and staff recommends the following designations for the continuation of these
programs:

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Program

Funding Source:

RSAT FFY17

Program Description
The goal of federal Resident Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) Program funding is to break
the cycle of drugs and violence by reducing the demand for and use of illegal drugs. RSAT
enhances the capabilities of states and units of local government to provide residential substance
abuse treatment for incarcerated inmates; prepares individuals for their reintegration into their
communities by incorporating reentry planning activities into treatment programs; and assists
individuals and their communities through the reentry process with community-based treatment
and other broad-based aftercare services.
A notice of funding opportunity was released in 2017 inviting eligible agencies to apply for
FFY14, FFY15, FFY16, and FFY17 RSAT grant funds. ICJIA conducted a Grants
Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA)–compliant, merit-based review process and
identified two programs for funding. The programs will fund competitively bid substance abuse
treatment services for juveniles under the control of the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice or
mentally ill and substance abusing women housed at the Illinois Department of Corrections
Logan Correctional Center.
No applications were received from local agencies.
Program Activities
The funded programs will:







Engage participants for between six and 12 months.
Provide residential treatment facilities set apart from the general correctional population,
either in a completely separate facility or dedicated housing unit in a facility exclusively
for use by RSAT participants.
Focus on the inmate’s substance use diagnosis and addiction-related needs.
Develop the inmate’s cognitive, behavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to solve
the substance use and related problems.
Require urinalysis and/or other proven reliable forms of drug and alcohol testing of
program participants, including both periodic and random testing, and of former
participants while they remain in the custody of the state or local government.
Prepare participants for successful community reintegration, including post-release
referral to appropriate evidence-based aftercare treatment and service providers that
support the use of medication-assisted treatment.

remain in their communities and to pay restitution to victims of their crimes.”
