Executive Director Strobel stated she have completed ten branch visits where she talks one-on-one or in
small groups with our branch staff. She has heard wonderful ideas, touching stories, great advice, and
some constructive criticism. They have all shared with the hope of making CCPL an even stronger
contributor to the well-being of those we serve. She also has future meetings scheduled with all the
Friends Groups and look forward to hearing their thoughts and advice as well.
Executive Director Strobel announced that Cuyahoga County Public Library (CCPL) will be the first library
in the nation to host the Drug Enforcement Agency’s (DEA) traveling exhibit, Drugs: Costs and
Consequences. This is a 5,500 square foot exhibit which is their community outreach effort seeking to
empower communities impacted by the heroin and opioid epidemic through awareness and education.
There will be thousands of visitors some will be bussed through school field trips, others coming from
around the region and all walks of life. Everyone will benefit from their visit where they can learn the story
of illegal drugs and the profound impact, it has on all of us. The exhibit will be at the Parma-Snow Branch
January through June 2020. It has been touring since 2002 and will be coming to us from Albuquerque,
Mexico. It has made a positive impact for those who have experienced it. This will be a great opportunity
to attract visitors to our Parma-Snow Branch and share library resources and a great opportunity for civic
engagement. There will be a Steering Committee formed which will include; leaders from around the
State and both U.S. Ohio Senators. The DEA will do most of the leg work. There is $100,000.00 to
support transportation for field trips and a full-time museum educator who will become a CCPL staff
member for the duration of the exhibit here and the coordination and the education aspects of it. The
exhibit will be set up in the Administration Building Auditorium, Mezzanine, and the Atrium. There are
twelve stations and a resource center. We will keep you posted as it develops. This region was targeted
for this exhibit because of the heavy use of opioids in the area. There are many organizations and
institutions around the region that wanted to do it but didn’t have the space.
Director Rich stated the DEA Steering Committee had some preliminary meetings and reached out and
connected with some major local foundations such as; The Cleveland Foundation and the Penn
Foundation. They want representation from law enforcement, U.S. Attorney and his office will be involved
as well as representatives from our regional DEA office in Detroit. This will be a nice opportunity to have
different stakeholders that we typically don’t interface with directly.
Executive Director Strobel stated there will be a soft opening in January and a formal opening event in
late January or early February.
Trustee Leonard asked if the exhibit would have expanded hours or regular business hours?
Executive Director Strobel answered it will be regular library branch business hours except for Sunday.
Human Resources Report:
Acting Human Resources Director Miller referred the Board to the HR report provided and gave highlights
from the HR report. He mentioned Executive Director Strobel’s compensation was added into the record
as well as Assistant Development Director Marnecheck’s resignation.
03-10/2019

Resources Report dated October 21, 2019, was approved as presented by unanimous vote of the Board

Finance Committee Report:
Finance Committee Chair Leonard reminded us that the Finance Committee met prior to the Board
meeting, and Director Morgan gave an in-depth review of the financials.
Director Morgan gave highlights from the Finance report. He stated in general property taxes there was
no activity for the month of September. Most of our advances from the County have already come in for
the year. We may see a small amount of revenue come in for the remainder of year.
Director Morgan stated in Public Library Fund (PLF) our September distribution was slightly larger than
the amount we received last year. Our budget is larger than last year.
Director Morgan stated interest rates are higher than anticipated and the larger increase has brought in
additional revenue. Based on some of our recent maturities we are beginning to see some of those
increases leveling off.
Director Morgan stated patron fines and fees are exceeding our original estimates due to passport fees
and photos. Sale of resale supplies are also slightly exceeding our estimates.
Director Morgan stated salaries and benefits are where they should be for the month. All other general
fund expense accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month of September.
Director Morgan stated in the capital project fund for Bay Village and Richmond Heights Branches we did
not get the revised budget completed. He will meet this week to finalize those numbers.
(See under FINANCE)
Investments - September
Director Morgan stated we purchased one piece of commercial paper from Toyota Motor Credit with a
yield of 2.01%. There were no other purchases or maturities to for the month.
Transfers
Director Morgan stated there were three transfers from the general fund to the special revenue funds.
Summer Camps

President Shlonsky stated the last time the Library went to the ballot was in 2008 at that time the Library’s
goal was not to return to the ballot for ten years and we have not. This is a result of good financial
stewardship; expense reductions and new revenue opportunities. Next month will be eleven years since
we put an issue on the ballot. During that time, we have invested a lot in capital we have created centers
of excellence, added efficiencies, but at the same time the revenue we received from property taxes have
decreased by more than 10% since 2008 and expenses continue to grow, as the finance report reflects
accelerating cost of health care and programming needs and requirements have become more
expensive. Earlier this month we had a Special Board meeting and deliberated if we could continue to cut
and address our shortfalls, we all agreed that wouldn’t work, it would resolve in significant cuts to our
services. Over the next ten years the projected budget deficit is clear. We need to go to the ballot in
2020. At the Special Board of Trustees meeting we approved three resolutions that gave us different
rates of millage to go forward and those resolutions have indicated we wanted to go in March. We met
with Representatives at the County and we have been thinking about the time considerations and the
educational needs we need to do, with that President Shlonsky is recommending we would be better
served by going forward in November. This would give us a better opportunity to educate the community
about what we need and why we are going forward. She stated we need to take the next step to
formalize our plan. She stated before we read the resolutions brought before you at this meeting, they
are the same as the resolutions we approved last month but shows November instead of March. She
asked the Board for comments and to discuss timeline.

Trustee DePiero commented he supports the resolution to go on the ballot in November. The Library has
done a good job and good financial stewardship by staying off the ballot. He commented going forward in
November gives us a good story to tell and a good chance and he is also confident the rest of the time is
needed to make the case and why we need the additional funding. Trustee DePiero asked about the
March resolutions we passed at the October 7, Special Board meeting and what happens with those?
Executive Director Strobel stated they were just inquiries, but we would need to send them again with the
November dates. If the Board still have the same sentiments at the November board meeting, we will
then take a second resolution which is a determination to proceed.
Trustee Leonard asked is it at that point when the Board decides which millage 0.50, 0.70 or 1.0?
Executive Director Strobel stated based on the response from the County Fiscal Officer they prepared
numbers with 0.50, 0.70 and 1.0 millages. Director Morgan confirms those numbers will not change with
our next request. This is the information the Board need to consider at our November board meeting.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
Looking Ahead
It has been 11 years since Cuyahoga County Public Library (CCPL) asked county
residents for an increase in financial support for their library system. The last time
CCPL was on the ballot was November 2008. At that time, voters approved a renewal
of our existing 2 mill levy plus an additional ½ mill. We also shifted to a continuing
levy so that we would not have to ask voters for a renewal or replacement every
couple of years.
We followed up our successful 2008 levy campaign by making a commitment not to
come back to voters for ten years. CCPL has made good on that commitment, but
over the past decade the revenues we have collected from our 2 ½ mill have declined
due to House Bill 920’s property tax reduction factor. In 2009 – CCPL’s first year of
collections at 2 ½ mill – we collected $47.68 million in local property taxes. In 2019,
we will collect $42.72 million – a 10.4% reduction. Revenue reductions combined
with rising costs for library materials, healthcare, and other goods and services
presents a challenging financial picture for our library system. Our ten-year
projections show a deficit in CCPL’s budget beginning in 2020.
Eleven years is a long time for CCPL to stay away from the ballot, but we have
managed to do it while also evolving to meet our communities’ changing needs and
maintaining the quality of our services. Along the way we have built upon CCPL’s
reputation as one of the most forward-thinking libraries in America and solidified our
position as one Cuyahoga County’s indispensable institutions. It seems like
everywhere I go I hear how much county residents love CCPL and the service they
receive from our staff. We have earned that love with lots of hard work and a dogged
commitment to excellence.
Over the past several months our Board has analyzed CCPL’s financial data and
considered our available options, including how we might balance our budget through
significant expenditure cuts such as decreased spending on library materials, deferred
facilities maintenance, program cutbacks and reduced hours. They have also reviewed
projections of CCPL’s financial future with additional revenue garnered from placing a
new property tax issue on the November, 2020 ballot. Now the Board must decide
which path is the best for both the future of CCPL and the people we serve.
On behalf of the CCPL staff, I want to thank our Board of Trustees for their hard work
in planning the financial future of our organization and their tremendous
commitment to providing the highest level of public library service to county
residents. I look forward to whatever comes next.

Sincerely,

Tracy Strobel
Executive Director

The Technical Services Division’s (TSD) Collection Development Department held a very successful staff forum
on using collectionHQ for better collection management. The forum, held at the Parma-Snow Branch, gave
staff the opportunity to discuss how collectionHQ’s data tools can provide deep insights into shelving needs
and which items are most popular at each branch.
Collection Development Department team member Mary Schrieber led the coordination of the second annual
School Librarian Book Buzz, presented in collaboration with Baker & Taylor. Twenty-eight school librarians
attended the sneak peek to see which soon-to-be-released titles will have readers buzzing.
Solon Branch staff members Mark Faldowski and Abby O’Neill spoke to a group of nearly 50 at the Solon
Senior Center about the recent changes in Ohio driver licenses and how they relate to commercial air travel.
They also took the opportunity to plug CCPL’s passport services. The audience was very appreciative of the
information and several people who came to the talk later visited the Solon Branch.

Ten teens attended the Scary Make-up program at the Independence Branch. Professional make-up artist
and horror guru Katie Lane, from Raven’s Wolf, applied gruesome bruises, scars and gaping wounds on
volunteers’ faces and arms.
Officer Cramer from the Garfield Heights Police Department was a special guest reader for the Music and
Movement storytime at the Garfield Heights Branch. Thirty-six parents and children enjoyed learning about a
police officer’s job and taking pictures with Officer Cramer after she read the book. One boy was especially
thrilled because he wants to be a police officer when he grows up.
On October 7, the Warrensville Heights Branch host a National Public Radio (NPR) Community Tours event
that was attended by nearly 100 guests. Branch Manager Ali Boyd and teen librarian Isabel Klein worked
with NPR staff for over a month plan the event. Guests engaged in conversation with the Warrensville Heights
City Schools superintendent, the school board president, teachers, Warrensville Heights Mayor Brad Sellers
and a student about the challenges facing the district.
Fifty-two guests visited the Beachwood Branch to hear a talk by NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani. Shahani
discussed her new memoir Here We Are: American Dreams, American Nightmares. Attendees learned about
Shahani’s experience as an immigrant growing up in New York and how the American justice system crushed
her family’s “American Dream”.
Maple Heights Branch staff member Young Koo led a discussion of Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, a story of four
generations of a Korean family living in Japan, and how they were mistreated and discriminated against by
the Japanese. Young, whose native country is Korea, displayed some items – including dried seaweed and a
bible – from Korea and wore a traditional dress during the discussion. Pachinko will soon be a mini-series, so
Young recommends getting a head start now, as the book is 490 pages!
The William N. Skirball Writers’ Center celebrated Indie Author Day on October 12 with its fourth annual
Indie Author Conference & Showcase held at the Parma-Snow Branch. A crowd of 80 guests listened to
speaker J. Thorn on “Understanding Amazon.com,” Willie and Rachel Scott on “Protecting Your Work” and
Dustin Brady on “How My Self-Publishing Book Sold Over 100K Copies.” Readers browsed new indie fiction
and nonfiction titles for adults, teens and children. New this year, authors read short, five-minute excerpts from
their books.
Southeast Branch staff member Sylvia Johnson led an African American Authors Book Group. The
discussion title was The Deepest Well: Healing the Long-Term Effects of Childhood Adversity by Nadine
Burke Harris M.D. Three members of the book group who are retired teachers have said that this book was
“transformative,” and that the problem of public-school education is the problem of ACE (Adverse Childhood
Experiences). Most of the students who are struggling in school are suffering from some type of trauma. Nine
of the 11 attendees were teachers.
The Strongsville Branch, in partnership with the Strongsville Historical Society, hosted “World War II Through Their
Eyes” on October 22. The program, presented by two Strongsville residents who shared their war experiences,
attracted 175 guests. John Simanella, a World War II veteran and member of local VFW Post 3345, recounted his
experience flying over 30 missions as a gunner on a B-24 bomber. Strongsville Historical Society member Sylvia
Pakish shared her personal stories as a civilian living in England with her family when the Germans bombed their
village. The City of Strongsville recorded the program to air on the local cable TV channel.

Thirty-one enthusiastic attendees visited the Bay Village Branch on a rainy night to hear a presentation by Dr.
James Van Keuren’s on World War II POW camps in Ohio. The highlight of the evening was when one of the
attendees revealed that his father-in-law had been a POW at Camp Perry and told some of the memories that
had been shared with the family.
Two weeks after Parma-Snow Branch staff members spoke to a men’s group at St. Frances De Sales, one of the
attendees visited the branch to praise their presentation. He exclaimed, “The library does so much and is well
worth taxpayer’s money.”
Fall 2019 session of Baby Club at the Fairview Park Branch is underway. Eight-five adults and 84 children

State University practicum student and a resource professional from Case Western University.
Brook Park Branch Manager Shayna Muckerheide was excited to participate in the city’s first Trunk or Treat
at the recreation center. The event was organized by the local Kiwanis Club and included the city’s fire and
police departments as well as city leaders. Approximately 200 people walked from car to car picking up
candy. CCPL stickers and pencils were especially popular!
Johnny Joo, photographer and the author of the books Ohio’s Forgotten History and Empty Spaces:
Photojournalism through the Rust Belt, visited the North Royalton Branch for a chilling, but mesmerizing visual
tour of desolate places left abandoned across the region. Sixty-one guests were captivated by the imagery.
The program was sponsored by the Friends of the North Royalton Library.
It was a memorable evening at the Parma Heights Branch on October 10 as 29 Kindergarten Club members
learned about nutrition while making burritos with whole wheat tortillas and black beans. Later, families made
a healthy snack – called “ants on a log” – with celery, soy nut butter, and raisins.

Financial Statement Analysis
October 2019

Revenues
For General Property Taxes we received what will be our settlement for the second half
of the year. We may see some much smaller amounts come in for the remainder of the
year. With this settlement we have exceeded our estimate for the year by $776,746.
Our October distribution for the PLF was larger than what we received last year. With
this distribution we are still on budget. We have also received a revised estimate for the
2019 PLF from the state and that estimate is a little over $377,000 than what we
originally budgeted. This is for increased collections as well as the slight increase in the
percentage that libraries received as part of the new biennium budget from the state
that began in July.
If that estimate is correct, the increased amount along with the increase in our budget
for General Property Taxes will fund our $1,000,000 carryover budgeted for 2020.
Interest is also exceeding our original estimates. The larger increase in rates than
expected has brought in additional revenue. Based on some of our recent maturities we
are beginning to see some of those increases leveling off.
Patron Fines and Fees in total are currently exceeding our estimates. Once again it is
passport fees and photos which are the reason for the increase. Sale of Resale
Supplies is also slightly exceeding our estimates.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
the year.

Expenses
Expenses for Salaries and Benefits are slightly ahead of budget. This is due to
expensing one additional payroll for the month of October. The account should be back
in balance for the month of November.
Many of the other expense accounts have higher than expected percentages for
expenses and encumbrances because many of these accounts have standing orders
encumbered against them to pay monthly and recurring expenses.
All other General Fund expense accounts are where we would expect them to be for the
month and the year.
In the Capital Fund projects the final expenses for the Maple Heights renovation were
paid. The only projects open are the Bay Village and Richmond Heights Branches.

 29

Investments
We purchased three pieces of commercial paper. Two pieces were purchased from
Citigroup Global Markets at a total of $305,000.00 ($125,000 and $180,000). The other
piece was purchased from Pfizer, Inc. at a par value of $305,000.

Transfers
There were 1 transfer from the General Fund to Special Revenue Funds for the ASPIRE
program match for the first quarter of the grant of $65,381.26.

Changes in the work which are within the general scope of this Agreement
may be accomplished without invalidating this Agreement by change
order, work change directive, or a minor change in the work subject to the
limitations stated in the contract documents.

b.

Contractor or Owner may request changes in the work within the general
scope of the contract documents. If such changes are made consisting of
additions, deletions or other revisions to the contract documents or scope

Completion or date of Final Completion shall be adjusted accordingly. All
such changes can occur only if authorized by applicable change order
agreed to and entered into by Owner and Contractor.

the work, Contractor’s fee, date of Substantial Completion or date of Final

Owner and Contractor shall negotiate expeditiously and in good faith for
appropriate adjustments arising out of Work Change Directives. As the

may be included in applications for payment and paid by Owner.

e.

be made to the construction fee, date of Substantial Completion and/or
date of Final Completion or a change in the work directed by a Work

If, in the performance of the Project, Contractor finds latent, concealed or
subsurface physical conditions which materially differ from the conditions
Contractor reasonably anticipated, or physical conditions materially
different than those normally encountered and generally recognized as
inherent in the kind of work provided for in this Agreement, then the
Contractor’s fee, date of Substantial Completion and/or date of Final
Completion shall be equitably adjusted by change order within a
reasonable time after the conditions are first observed. Contractor shall
provide Owner with prompt written notice of any such unknown condition
upon discovery. Contractor acknowledges, however, that it has examined,
inspected and satisfied itself as to all reasonably expected surface and
subsurface conditions of the Project site.

g.

An increase or decrease in the Contractor’s Fee resulting from a change in
the work shall be determined by one or more of the following methods:

h.

23.



Unit price as set forth in this Agreement or as subsequently agreed;



A mutually-accepted, itemized lump sum; or



If an increase or decrease cannot be agreed to among the parties and
the Owner issues a Work Change Directive, the cost of the change in
the work shall be determined by the reasonable actual expense and/or
savings of the performance of the work resulting from the change.

If unit prices are indicated in the contract documents or are subsequently
agreed to by the parties, but the character or quantity of such unit items as
originally contemplated are so different in a proposed Change Order that
the original unit prices will cause substantial inequity to the Owner or
Contractor, such unit prices shall be equitably adjusted.

Claims for Additional Cost or Time.
For any claim for an increase in the Contractor’s fee, date of Substantial
Completion or date of Final Completion, Contractor shall give the Owner written
notice of the claim within seven days after the occurrence giving rise to the claim
or within seven days after the Contractor first recognizes the condition giving rise
to the claim, whichever is later. Except in an emergency, notice shall be given
before proceeding with the work. Any change in the Contractor’s fee, date of
Substantial Completion or date of Final Completion resulting from such claim
shall be authorized by Change Order.

or loss. Any change in the Contractor’s fee, date of Substantial
Completion or date of Final Completion on account of emergency work
shall be determined as provided for in this Agreement.

In the event substantial changes in law or regulations effecting the
performance on the Project are enacted after the date of this Agreement,
the Contractor’s fee, date of Substantial Completion and/or date of Final
Completion shall be equitably adjusted by Change Order.

Suspension and Termination of the Agreement and Owner’s Right to Perform
Contractor’s Responsibility.
a.

Owner may order Contractor, in writing, to suspend, delay or interrupt any
part of the Project without cause for such period of time as the Owner may
determine to be appropriate. Adjustments caused by such suspension,
delay or interruption shall be made by Owner if it results in an increase in
the Contractor’s fee, date of Substantial Completion and/or date of Final
Completion. No adjustments shall be made if the Contractor is or
otherwise would have been responsible for the suspension, delay or
interruption of the Project or if another provision of this Agreement is
applied to render an equitable adjustment.

b.

If the Contractor persistently fails to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement, Owner may, after five days written notice, during the

Tenant. Landlord shall assure that the mechanical systems and utility capacities designed
for the Upper School Project are suf?cient for construction and operation of the Branch.

Landlord, at its cost, shall construct the Building and the Library
Shell and Core, together with the other components of the Upper School Project
necessary to Tenant?s use and operation of the Branch, in good workmanlike
manner and in accordance with the Plans and, with respect to the Library Shell

the Demising Wall to the exterior foundation/exterior wall perimeter), including, but not
limited to, the Branch Premises roof, exterior walls, foundation, structural components,

driveways, exterior signage and wayfmding signage) shall be borne by Landlord.

C. Standards; Compliance with Laws and Codes. The party required to
maintain, repair or replace any item, shall do so in prompt, workmanlike manner and in
accordance with all applicable laws and local building codes. Each party shall coordinate
its maintenance, repairs and replacements with the other party so as to avoid unreasonable
interference with the use of common areas or facilities and to avoid unreasonable
interference with the operations of the other. To the extent maintenance, repair or
replacement conducted by Tenant would materially interfere with the school operations in
the Upper School by reason of materially disruptive noise or the creation of unsafe
conditions), the same (except in the case of an emergency) shall be scheduled where
practicable during Upper School breaks or during non?school hours or pursuant to a plan
approved in good faith by the Landlord to ensure safety and the avoidance of material
interference with school operations in the Upper School.

D. Coordination Where Common Walls or Adjacent Improvements Involved.
The parties acknowledge that certain components of the Upper School and Branch are
immediately adjacent (such as the Demising Wall) or have integrated function (such as the
roof and roofing system at the point of connection of the Branch to the remainder of the
Upper School). In regards to common walls and integrated adjacent improvements
(?Adjacent Improvements?), it is agreed:

Each party shall maintain its portion of the Adjacent Improvements
separately so far as practicable without damage or impairment of the utility and function
thereof necessary to the improvements of the other party;

(such as the area at or above the centerline of the Demising Wall), may materially affect the
other party?s premises, the parties shall coordinate with one another prior to either
undertaking the repair or maintenance. In the event required repair or maintenance is an
emergency of such nature to be required to prevent immediate significant damage (such as a
signi?cant water leak), the party undertaking emergency repairs may institute immediate
repairs provided it notifies the other party. Where repair, maintenance or
replacement of an Adjacent Improvement involves portions or components that are assigned
variously to both parties (such as the each party?s portion of the Demising Wall or roofing
system over the same), the cost of the repair, maintenance and replacement of the Adjacent
Improvement shall be shared equitably by the parties based on an agreement to be reached
prior to making the repair (or immediately thereafter in the case of an emergency repair).

E. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event any
maintenance, repair or replacement is made necessary by the negligent or wrongful act of a

13

13032253 _8

82

party or a party?s agent, contractor, or employee, that party shall be responsible for the cost
of the required maintenance, repair or replacement.

7.02 Alterations or Improvements. After initial construction, ?xturing and move-in,
Tenant may make or may permit to be made, alterations or improvements to the Branch
Premises, but only if Tenant obtains the prior written consent of Landlord thereto which consent

however, for interior, non?structural improvements which do not adversely affect the Building.
With respect to any Tenant alterations or improvements, Tenant shall secure all necessary
permits and shall make the alterations and improvements in accordance with all applicable laws
and building codes, in a good and workmanlike manner. To the extent alterations or
improvements would materially interfere with the school operations in the Upper School g. by
reason of materially disruptive noise or the creation of unsafe conditions), the alterations or
improvements (except in the case of an emergency) shall be scheduled where practicable during
Upper School breaks or during non-school hours or pursuant to a plan approved in good faith by
the Landlord to ensure safety and the avoidance of material interference with school operations in
the Upper School. If interior, non-structural improvements would require closures of the Library
or prevent library use during hours when the memorandum of understanding terms (described in
Recital D) would provide for the library services to be available to students, Tenant will
endeavor in good faith to advise Landlord of the service interruptions to be caused by the
improvements. 

Tenant shall pay all costs attributable to such alterations and improvements.
Tenant shall repair any damage to the Branch Premises or the Building caused by any
such alterations or improvements. Any alterations or improvements to the Branch Premises, except
movable furniture, equipment and trade ?xtures, shall become a part of the realty and the property
of Landlord, and shall not be removed by Tenant without Landlord?s written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

by Landlord, Tenant shall be responsible for the cost of reconstruction of such. Plans and
speci?cations for reconstruction shall be developed by Landlord with Tenant having the right to

hundred eighty (180) days computed from the hypothetical date of commencement of such
construction after adjustment of any insurance claim, or is not completely restored or rebuilt
within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of commencement of such construction, then

date of commencement of such construction; (ii) extend the date of completion up to ninety (90)
days; or pursue such other legal remedies as are available in the event that Landlord has
failed to diligently pursue reconstruction.

This Lease shall terminate on the Termination Date, except with respect to obligations
and liabilities of Tenant or Landlord hereunder, actual or contingent, which have arisen on or
prior to the Termination Date, and the net insurance proceeds from Landlord?s insurance shall
belong to Landlord. In the event of such a termination, all proceeds of Tenant?s casualty
insurance shall belong to the Tenant.

casualty, but not substantially destroyed or damaged to the extent provided in Section 8.01, then
such damaged part of the Building shall be reconstructed and restored within sixty (60)
days from the receipt of insurance proceed, by Landlord using available insurance proceeds, and
if such amounts are insuf?cient to complete such reconstruction, then Landlord shall contribute
funds necessary to complete such reconstruction; provided, however, that Landlord?s obligation
hereunder shall be limited to the reconstruction of such of the Building and Library Shell and
Core as were originally made by Landlord and others (including any Tenant Improvements if
included in Landlord?s insurance) which are insured or required to be insured by Landlord, and
further provided that, if Tenant has made any Tenant Improvements and/or additional
improvements pursuant to Section 7.02 which are not insured, Tenant shall be responsible for the

8.03 Casualty Insurance.

A. Landlord Casualty Insurance. Landlord, at its expense, shall at all times
during the term of this Lease carry a policy of casualty insurance which insures the
Building, including the Library Shell and Core, against loss or damage by ?re, ?ood,
earthquake or other casualty (namely, the perils against which insurance is afforded by a
standard so called ?all-risk? or ?extended coverage? insurance policy in an amount not less
than one hundred percent (100%) of the replacement cost of the Building and Library
Shell and Core); provided, however, that Landlord shall not be responsible for, and shall not
be obligated to insure against, any loss of or damage to any personal property of Tenant of
which Tenant may have in the Building or the Branch Premises or any trade ?xtures
installed by or paid for by Tenant or any other occupant or absent special arrangement in
writing between Landlord and Tenant to provide insurance on the same, any additional
improvements which Tenant or any other occupant may construct on the Project Site; and,
notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Landlord shall not be liable, and
Tenant releases Landlord from liability, for any loss or damage to such property, regardless
of cause, except for the gross negligence of Landlord and its employees, agents, customers
and invitees.

B. Tenant Casualty Insurance. Tenant, at its expense, shall at all times during
the term of this Lease carry a policy of casualty insurance, which insures the Tenant
Improvements and other alterations made by Tenant, against loss or damage by ?re, ?ood,
earthquake or other casualty (namely, the perils against which insurance is afforded by a
standard so called ?all?risk? or ?extended coverage? insurance policy in an amount not less
than one hundred percent (100%) of the full replacement cost of the Tenant Improvements
and other alterations made by Tenant.

8.04 Waiver of Subrogation. Landlord and Tenant hereby release each other and each
other?s employees, agents, customers and invitees from any and all liability for any loss, damage,
or injury to person or property occurring in, on, about, or to the Branch Premises, Building, or
personal property within the Building or Branch Premises, by reason of ?re or other casualty
which could be insured against under a standard ?re and extended coverage insurance policy,
regardless of cause, including the negligence of Landlord or Tenant and their respective
employees, agents, customers and invitees, and agree that such insurance carried by either of
them shall contain a clause whereby the insurer waives its right of subrogation against the other
party, provided such insurance is available. Because the provisions of this Section 8.04 are
intended to preclude the assignment of any claim mentioned herein by way of subrogation or
otherwise to an insurer or any other person, each party to this Lease shall give to each insurance
company which has issued to it one or more policies of ?re and extended coverage insurance
notice of the provisions of this Section 8.04 and have such insurance policies properly endorsed,

if necessary, to prevent the invalidation of such insurance by reason of the provisions of this
Section 8.04.

the entire net award so remaining, less any costs incurred by Landlord or mortgagee in
connection therewith. If the cost of any repairs required to be made by Tenant pursuant to this
Article shall exceed the amount of the net award, the de?ciency shall be paid by Tenant.

whichever is earlier and for its Tenant Improvements or alterations, and Landlord shall be entitled
to appear, claim, prove and receive the entire balance of the award. Each party shall cooperate fully
with the other in efforts to obtain any such award, and each claimant shall indemnify and hold
harmless the other party to the extent of expenses incurred as a result of such cooperation.

or attested account is valid or enforceable as such), Tenant shall, at its own expense, cause the
same to be discharged of record or bonded within thirty (30) days after the date of written
demand therefor from Landlord. In the event that Tenant does not cause such lien or attested

utilization and comparison to other Branches, library industry statistics and metrics, operating
costs, changing demographics, technological advancements and considerations, and any other
bona ?de factors. Written notice of termination shall be given by Tenant no less than two
hundred seventy (270) days prior the effective date of termination. Prior to the effective date of

Tenant remove the same and repair any damage caused thereby.

In the event the Landlord shall cease operating a full school year public school schedule
in the Building, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this at any time thereafter upon written
notice to the Landlord. Such shall be treated as if the Landlord had elected to terminate the Lease
under Section 20.01 effective the date of the Tenant?s termination hereunder with Tenant entitled
to compensation and bene?ts as noted in Section 20.0l.
