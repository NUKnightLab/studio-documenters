 EXPLANATION
In 2007, the CHA Board of Commissioners and the Executive Staff embarked upon a strategic
planning effort to ensure that the agency moved forward in the proper direction concurrent to the
requirements of the CHA Plan for Transformation. Now past tenth year of the Plan for
Transformation, the goals and objectives of the agency are focused on maintaining a new portfolio of
assets and ensuring that creative methods are used to complete the rehabilitation and redevelopment
efforts within the constraints of our current economic climate.
This Strategic Plan evolved into the following five (5) Vision Statements:
I.
II.
III.
IV.
V.

An Award Winning Portfolio
A Well Managed and Fiscally Sound Agency
A Collaborative Environment with Quality Talent
A Resident Sensitive and Responsibility focused Agency
An agency with useful and productive Partnerships

In addition, several critical objectives were developed out of the vision statements, including:
Increasing Occupancy, Establishing an effective Asset Management Structure, Aligning the Agency
with the Strategic Plan and New Asset Management Model, Improving Management Capacity, and
Recruiting and retaining highly skilled employees. These vision statements will continue to evolve
throughout the next 24 months in accordance with the needs of the agency, as well as the influences
of the economy and the real estate market.
Throughout the course of 2008 and 2009, the prior strategic planning engagement successfully
assisted the CHA in 1) aligning the agency in a manner that critically matches the Strategic Plan; 2)
addressing organizational design issues, matching the proper staff with the appropriate functions
within the agency’s new organizational structure; 3) ensuring that the new alignment has created
provisions for accountability for all Strategic Plan Participants; 4) ensuring that there is a deliberate
reporting mechanism to the Board of Commissioners and all staff so that all parties understand where
the agency is in the process of the Strategic Plan as it relates to the Plan for Transformation. These
efforts have been accomplished through the facilitation of quarterly retreats with top management.
The next steps in order to accomplish the subsequent objectives of the Strategic Plan are to:
1. Continue Executive Coaching for the team members reporting to the Chief Executive Officer/
President to further the success of the agency’s strategic alignment;
2. Provide for tactical and strategic planning intervention when necessary to support the
executive team and their divisions in order to comply with federal, city and other mandates
and initiatives;
3. Facilitate Leadership and Board of Commissioner quarterly retreats to assist in the effective
communication of the implementation of the Strategic Plan.
This engagement will carry out the objectives noted above via a 2 year term contract (February 2010February 2012), with a 1 year extension option.
