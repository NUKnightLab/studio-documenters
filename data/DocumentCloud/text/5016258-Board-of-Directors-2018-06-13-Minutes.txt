 PROJECTS
Joe Louis Arena Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Walters disclosed his role in the development of the Joe Louis Arena Brownfield in
his capacity as an employee of the City of Detroit.
Ms. Kanalos presented the Brownfield Plan for the Joe Louis Arena Redevelopment
Project.
Project Introduction
In connection with the development of the property commonly known as the “Little
Caesars Arena”, an agreement was reached by the applicable parties to demolish the
JLA once the Little Caesars Arena was completed and ready for use. As of the date of
this Plan, the Little Caesars Arena has been completed and the Detroit Red Wings have
vacated the JLA and relocated to the Little Caesars Arena.
The primary purpose of this Plan is to facilitate the demolition of the JLA and to prepare
the Property for a future mixed-use development, which may include residential,
commercial, and/or retail space. For the purposes of this Plan, the use of the term
“Developer” shall refer to the City of Detroit. The City of Detroit is the owner of Joe Louis
Arena and the Detroit Building Authority will oversee demolition.
Total TIF reimbursement amount for the demolition and related eligible activities under
this Plan is $5,561,009.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of six (6) parcels located at 27 Washington
Boulevard. The common address of the JLA is also known as “600 Civic Center Drive.”
25 Washington Boulevard, 29 Washington Boulevard, 31 Washington Boulevard, and 33
Washington Boulevard are properties that are adjacent and continuous to 27 Washington
Boulevard. 501 Third is also adjacent to 27 Washington Boulevard and is the location of
the Detroit People Mover – Joe Louis Arena Station Stop. The Property is located
adjacent to the Central Business District and is generally bounded by Jefferson Street to
the north, Atwater Street to the east, Detroit River to the south and Cobo Convention
Center to the west.
Basis of Eligibility
The Property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the Property was previously utilized for a public purpose; (b) it is located within the
City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is
determined to be a functionally obsolete or adjacent and contiguous as defined by Act
381.

 Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include environmental
assessment activities, demolition and abatement and brownfield plan and work plan
preparation and brownfield plan implementation. The eligible activities and budgeted
costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed solely
by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and
will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin within eighteen months
and be completed within three (3) years.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

Other Incentives
The Developer is seeking a loan through the Michigan Strategic Fund’s Community
Revitalization Program.
Ms. Mays asked if there are any developers involved in the redevelopment of Joe Louis
Arena. Ms. Kanalos and Mr. Walters advised that there are no developers at this time.
Ms. Mays asked if there is any risk to approving the Joe Louis Arena Brownfield Plan in
the absence of a developer. Mr. Walters and Ms. Kanalos advised that the risk is for the

 Michigan Strategic Fund and the City of Detroit due to the cost of the deconstruction of
the structure.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the referral of the Joe Louis Arena Brownfield
Plan and its submittal to the DBRA-CAC as presented. The Board took the following
action:
On a motion by Ms. Mays, seconded by Ms. Wilkins, DBRA Resolution Code 1806-256-01 was unanimously approved.

Reimbursement Agreement for the Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for the
Former Free Press Building Redevelopment Project
Mr. Vosburg presented the proposed Reimbursement Agreement for the Amended and
Restated Free Press Building Brownfield Plan. Mr. Vosburg noted that DBRA legal
counsel is working on a few edits requested by the developer to call out unique aspects
of the project described in the Brownfield Plan such as the transfer of the MBT Credit,
and the fact that Eligible Activities have started and are mostly complete for the building
due to the change in MEDC/MSF policy during the middle of the previous approval
process.
On May 9, 2018, the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (the “DBRA”) Board of
Directors recommended approval to City Council of the Amended and Restated
Brownfield Plan for the Former Free Press Building 321 W. Lafayette Redevelopment
Project (the “Plan”) which was subsequently approved by Detroit City Council on June 12,
2018. A requirement for Tax Increment Financing reimbursement pursuant to the Plan is
that a Reimbursement Agreement (the “Agreement”) be entered into between the DBRA
and Pyramid Development Co., LLC. The Agreement was prepared between the DBRA
and the Developer and presented for review and approval.
Project Introduction
On July 29, 2010, the City Council of the City of Detroit (“City Council”) approved the
Brownfield Plan for the Free Press Redevelopment Project (the “Original Plan”). As you
may recall, the City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) Board of
Directors (“Board”) previously approved a recommendation to City Council to: (i)
terminate the Original Plan in accordance with Act 381; and (ii) approve a new brownfield
plan for the Former Free Press Building. Due to changes in the Michigan Economic
Development Corporation (MEDC) policy related to Michigan Business Tax (MBT) Credits
that occurred after the aforementioned Board recommendations, DBRA was advised that
in order to preserve the MBT Credit for this project, the Original Plan could not be
terminated. As a result, instead of terminating the Original Plan and approving a new
Brownfield Plan, DBRA staff is now seeking the Board’s approval to begin the process to
amend and restate the Original Plan with the attached Plan which will allow the Developer
(as defined below) to preserve the MBT Credit and include additional eligible activities.
The Plan described is largely the same project previously presented to the Board in April
of 2017.

 Pyramid Development Co., LLC, a Bedrock Detroit affiliate, is the project developer (the
“Developer”) for the Plan which entails the rehabilitation of the 276,183 square foot former
Detroit Free Press building into a mixed-use building with retail on the first floor, office on
the second and third floors, and residential on floors 4-17 and an undetermined use for
the basement and sub-basement. First through third floor tenants have not been
determined at this time.
It is estimated that approximately 196 temporary construction jobs will be created and
approximately 10 direct permanent jobs will be created in connection with the
redevelopment. Additional permanent jobs are expected to be created by the retail and
office tenants. The Developer has agreed to comply with City Executive Orders 2016-1
and 2014-4.
Total investment is expected to be approximately $69,663,000.00. The Developers are
requesting $7,989,347.00 in TIF reimbursement under the proposed Plan.
As mentioned previously, a Brownfield Plan, an Act 381 Work Plan, and a Large
Brownfield MBT Credit, titled “Detroit Free Press House” and “Free Press Plaza and
Apartments” were approved for the Eligible Property in 2010. The Developer is requesting
the amendment and restatement of the “Detroit Free Press House” Brownfield Plan,
approved in 2010. The Brownfield Plan, Act 381 Work Plan, and the Brownfield MBT
Credit (the “Credit”) will be amended and restated to modify the following: legal
descriptions, scope of Project, Eligible Activities, and Eligible Investment that was
included in the original approvals.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of a single (1) parcel containing only the
Free Press Building located at 321 West Lafayette Boulevard on the west side of
downtown Detroit.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized or is currently utilized for a commercial purpose;
(b) it is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act
381; and (c) the Property is determined to be Functionally Obsolete.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include site demolition,
selective building demolition, lead & asbestos surveying, asbestos abatement, air
monitoring, hazardous material removal, site preparation, and preparation of a brownfield
plan and work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the
development of the Property and will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority
is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The eligible
activities began in the third quarter of 2017 and are estimated to be complete no later

 than March 2021. Based on the existing Credit, the Project must be completed and
receive a temporary certificate of occupancy by March 8th, 2021 in order to receive the
Credit.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

Other Development Incentives

Michigan Business Tax Credit for the property as well as a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone
Abatement (PA 147). In addition, the Developer also anticipates a Commercial
