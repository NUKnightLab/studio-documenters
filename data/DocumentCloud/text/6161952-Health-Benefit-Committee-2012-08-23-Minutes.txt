2. Segal Annual Health Benefits Renewal

1
July 26, 2012 HBC Meeting

 Segal reviewed the medical renewal from BCBSIL (PPO administration fee increased 3% and HMO
increased 1.5%), 2013 Health Benefit Rates, unified and non unified status as well as Fund Health
Benefit Contributions. It was discussed that renewal year was favorable in experience and migrating
to a 100% non-unified status this year was advisable. It was also discussed that decreasing fund
contributions of 1% was also advisable. The cost of the previously approved MedExpert vendor
$2.75 per annuitant per month could also be built into the cost of the members premium. Multiple
scenarios were reviewed.
It was moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee Benjamin that all the renewal
recommendations be adopted.
Vote Result: MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE.
3. Adjournment
There being no further business to come before the Committee upon a motion duly made and
seconded the meeting was adjourned.
Vote Result: MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE.
