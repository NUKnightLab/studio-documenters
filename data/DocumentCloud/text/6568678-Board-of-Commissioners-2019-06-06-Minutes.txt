PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1384 - THE MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT
WHEREAS, the United States spends nearly twice as much per capita on health care as all other
comparable countries and yet ranks only 35th in the world by global health standards, including on such
critical barometers as average life expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and death from
preventable diseases; and
WHEREAS, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enacted important improvements, primarily through the
expansion of Medicaid in states that have agreed to do so, and limits on some insurance industry abuses,
that reform left tens of millions with a continuing crisis in access, cost, and quality of care; and
WHEREAS, the uninsured rate for U.S. adults has risen for four straight years up to nearly 30 million,
even after implementation of the ACA, with the greatest increase among women, young adults, and lowerincome people; and
3

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 6, 2019

WHEREAS, tens of millions more who pay for insurance remain underinsured due to the still largely
unregulated high cost of medical care that has led to one-third of all GoFundMe accounts being established
to pay for exorbitant medical bills; and
WHEREAS, more than 40 percent of all U.S. adults under the age of 65 forego needed medical care, 30
percent fail to fill a prescription or take less than the recommended dose, and a third said they had to choose
in the past year between paying for food, heating, housing, or health care, according to a 2018 survey by
the West Health Institute and NORC at the University of Chicago; and
WHEREAS, the inability to pay medical bills continues to be a leading cause of personal bankruptcy, and
people who need medical care should never face bankruptcy as a result of needing care; and
WHEREAS, the ever-rising cost of health care and its discriminatory characteristics contribute to the
growing national chasm in wealth inequality; and
WHEREAS, discrimination, based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age,
socioeconomic status, and where one lives is particularly systematic to a profit-based health care system;
and
WHEREAS, 55 percent of the uninsured are people of color; African Americans suffer higher death rates
than whites at an earlier age due to heart disease, diabetes, cancer, HIV, and infant mortality; AfricanAmerican women are three to four times more likely than white women to die in childbirth; and AfricanAmerican and Latino students are more likely to experience health risks due to exposure to toxins and air
pollution at school; and
WHEREAS, continued attacks on the ACA by the Trump administration and GOP in Congress have given
insurance companies a new pretext to demand double-digit premium increases, while the government’s
failure to maintain taxpayer subsidies to help moderate-income families pay the high cost of insurance plans
has exacerbated the crisis experienced by millions of American families; and
WHEREAS, employer-provided health benefits are declining and employees’ costs are increasing through
cost-shifting to workers, including increased cost of premiums for workers covered by employer-paid
insurance, which have risen by an average of 65 percent, and deductibles have risen by an average of 212
percent over the past decade; and
WHEREAS, many other countries around the world use taxes to pay for national universal health care,
which leaves U.S. based companies that pay for employee health care at a competitive disadvantage; and
WHEREAS, due to their profit incentive, private insurance companies deny up to one-fourth of all claims
for care and restrict patient choice through narrow networks for doctors and hospitals, limited drug
formularies, and other limits in coverage; and
WHEREAS, the United States ranks first in cost, but only 35th among countries of the world in health
system outcomes and quality according to the Lancet and worse for infant mortality and life expectancy,
with no relationship between what health care costs in the United States and the quality of care or access to
care; and
4

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 6, 2019

WHEREAS, the Medicare for All Act, H.R. 1384, would: • Establish guaranteed, universal health care for
all U.S. residents
• Provide comprehensive health care, including all primary care, hospital and outpatient services, dental,
vision, audiology, maternity and newborn care, women’s reproductive services, mental health,
prescription drugs, and long-term care services
• Eliminate all costs for premiums, deductibles, copays, and other out-of- pocket costs that have caused
such a crisis for tens of millions of people
• Ensure genuine patient choice of any doctor, hospital, clinic, or other provider a patient chooses without
the restrictions imposed by private insurers
• Sharply reduce the cost of prescription drugs by authorizing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices
as most of the rest of the world does
• Protect the ability of service veterans to continue to receive their specialized care through the Veterans
Administration if they choose, and Native Americans to receive their medical benefits through the
Indian Health Service if they choose; and
WHEREAS nearly all U.S. residents and businesses would spend less, and usually far less, under a
Medicare for All program, such as H.R. 1384, than they do today for health coverage and medical, dental,
vision, and other care; and
WHEREAS , various studies, both conservative and progressive, have estimated that the U.S. would save
from $2 trillion to $5 trillion over 10 years over what our country is projected to spend under the current
system, due to massive savings in administration costs, lower prescription drug prices, and improved
efficiency through a uniform payment system with global budgeting - without the waste for billing,
marketing, profit-taking; and
WHEREAS, the Medicare for All Act, H.R. 1384, would establish a system of public financing that retains
the private provider system with real patient choice and greater transparency on how our public dollars are
spent; and
WHEREAS public opinion polls show up to 70 percent public support for a Medicare for All/single-payer
health care system and for the government to guarantee health care for all people living in the United States;
and
WHEREAS the Medicare for All Act, H.R. 1384, would establish peace of mind for everyone, relieving
worry about medical bills and access to needed care through a humane system based on patient need, not
ability to pay
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Cook County affirms that health care is a human right
that should be guaranteed to all U.S. residents; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County endorses H.R. 1384, the Medicare for All Act that
will expand health coverage and health security, eliminate health disparities, and lower health care costs
for all of our community residents.

MEETING OF JUNE 5, 2019

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Robert J. Lovero, Mayor, City of Berwyn
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

City of Berwyn

Volume and Property Index Number:
003, 16-19-422-024-0000; 004, 16-29-308-032-0000; 007, 16-31-313-009-0000
Summary: The City of Berwyn would like to participate in the No-Cash Bid program. We would like to
request the parcels of land with the following PINs: This request package contains a request for three (3)
properties on three (3) PINs. While Ordinance No.18-29 approves five (5) property index numbers
(PINs), this request package is only for the above listed three (3) occupied single-family homes: occupied
by son of owner-status of owner unknown; owner occupied; and in the name of a trust with unknown
occupants. The other two (2) PINs are not requested at this time. The intended use for the three (3)
occupied residential properties will be for redevelopment and/or rehabilitation, elimination of blight and
neighborhood stabilization. The occupancy of the properties is stated above next to the PINS. The City of
Berwyn will encourage redemption of delinquent taxes as its goal is not to displace residents, but return
the properties to the tax rolls.
A known Third Party, the Berwyn Development Corporation (the “BDC”) will be acquiring and managing
the properties on behalf of the City following acquisition through the No Cash Bid program. Should the
properties prove to be in stable condition with minimal rehabilitation costs, BDC staff recommends the
establishment of the Berwyn First Time Homeownership Program, a program for Berwyn Police, Berwyn
Fire and other qualifying individuals who may be seeking to buy property in and move closer to the
community. The process is described in further detail in the Third Party Requestor Package. If the
properties need to be rehabbed, the BDC will be responsible; the properties will then be sold. The City will
file for tax exempt status on said properties and maintain the status until parcels are transferred to new
owner(s). Legal counsel will be sought out in order to obtain the tax deed on behalf of the BDC and the
103

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

BDC will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. Additionally, the
BDC will send a No-Cash Bid Report to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development on the
status of the parcels for five (5) years or until development and/or rehabilitation is complete, whichever
occurs last.

Summary: This letter is to express the Village of Chicago Ridge’s interest in receiving a No Cash Bid
for parcels located in Chicago Ridge. The permanent index numbers of the parcels requested are: This
Request Package contains 3 PINs (the “Subject Property”). The PINs requested currently contain a
partially occupied commercial structure on parcels in the Village of Chicago Ridge. It is the intent of the
Village of Chicago Ridge, as part of its overall economic development strategy, to acquire the Subject
Property and return it to a beneficial use for the citizens of the Village. Presently only one of the three
units is occupied by a dental lab which is a tenant of the Subject Property. The building sits directly south
of a large undeveloped piece of property suitable for redevelopment and north of a beautiful banquet
facility. Upon acquisition, it is the Village’s intent to remove the tenants, demolish the structure and market
it for redevelopment. This building is already a longstanding eyesore that brings down the value of
surrounding properties and it is located on Ridgeland Avenue, the main street through the middle of
Chicago Ridge.
The Village of Chicago Ridge has retained legal counsel in order to obtain the tax deeds and will bear all
costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. In accordance with the requirements of the Cook
County No Cash Bid Ordinance, the Village of Chicago Ridge will submit to the Cook County Office of
Economic Development a No Cash Bid Report on the status of each parcel for five years or until
development is complete whichever comes last. In accordance with the requirements of the Cook County
No Cash Bid Program, the Village of Chicago Ridge hereby certifies that it does not have an identified
third party requestor associated with the filing of this application and will accordingly take the necessary
steps to have the Subject Property declared tax exempt for municipal use and will submit to the Cook
County Board of Review a Real Estate Exemption Complaint for tax exempt status which will be
maintained until title is transferred to a new owner.

Chicago Ridge, as part of its overall economic development strategy, to acquire the Subject Property and
return it to a beneficial use for the citizens of the Village. The Subject Property is being utilized as a
storage facility which is occupied and operated by the owner of the Subject Property. It is located within
the Village’s Harlem Avenue TIF District and this blighted structure presents a clear obstacle to serious
development of the 78 acre neighboring vacant property. The Village hopes to acquire the storage facility,
to remove the owner and renters, and demolish it in order to reduce the blight and accommodate possible
tollway improvements and potential commercial redevelopment of remaining land.
The Village of Chicago Ridge has retained legal counsel in order to obtain tax deeds and will bear all costs
associated with the acquisition of the parcels. In accordance with the requirements of the Cook County
No Cash Bid Ordinance, the Village of Chicago Ridge will submit to the Cook County Office of Economic
Development a No Cash Bid Report on the status of each parcel for five years or until development is

Summary: On behalf of the Village of Crestwood (the “Village”), and pursuant to the duly enacted
resolution by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Crestwood, this letter shall serve as notice of the
Village’s interest in the No Cash Bid for the following parcel: The number of parcels in this request is one
(1). The property is currently vacant, unoccupied and unused, and it is the intention of the Village to return
this parcel to tax-paying status through commercial redevelopment. The property is located nearby other
Village of Crestwood NCB PINs from prior rounds and we find that there is interest in this property for
use as a truck stop, gas station or convenience facility. This would benefit the Village by adding
commercial property and businesses to the Village and increasing the Village’s assessed valuation.
The Village will initially file for tax exempt status upon receipt and filing of tax deeds, but expects to
return the property to tax-paying status at the earliest possible time. At the present time there are no Third
Party Requests, no prospective developers and no organizations identified to assume development or
ownership of this parcel. The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds and bear all legal and
other costs associated with acquisition of the parcel. The Village of Crestwood agrees to submit to the
Cook County Department of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for
five years or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No
Cash Bid Ordinance.

the Cook County no-cash bid program. The Village is interested in acquiring certain property located
within Village of Thornton that is delinquent in real estate taxes or special assessments for two or more

The Village agrees to report the status of the parcel to the Cook County Department of Planning &
Development annually for five consecutive years or until the intended use is complete, whichever occurs

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Jon Sfondilis, Village Manager, Village of Wheeling
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of Wheeling

Summary: The Village of Wheeling, (the “Village”) has targeted two parcels within the Village for
redevelopment or for the use for municipal purposes. In the interest of utilizing these properties for said
purposes, the Village is seeking title to the following tax delinquent properties and requests that the Cook
County Board of Commissioners submit a No Cash Bid for both properties on behalf of the Village. The
PINs in this Request Package are as follows: This Request Package contains two (2) PINs
03-10-201-072-0000 and 03-10-201-074-0000, which are vacated parcels commonly addressed as 221
South Wheeling Road, formerly occupied by the Evanger’s Dog and Cat Food Company, Inc. The former
occupant has relocated their operations outside the Village and the existing structures are unoccupied and
are not structurally suitable for reuse. The Village has determined the parcels to no longer be fitting for
industrial uses, but acquiring them could help aid in the assemblage of parcels in this area to create a
133

larger land area for redevelopment. Alternately, the land could be used by the Village for Metra commuter
parking to expand the availability of commuter parking within close proximity to the train station.
Acquisition of the parcels will also allow the Village to address ongoing issues with the vacated industrial
facility and allow for proper clean-up of the land, and further the Village’s efforts to relocate heavy
industrial uses from this area due to the expansion of commercial retail and residential developments of
nearby land.
The Village will file for tax exempt status as long as it retains the PINs for municipal use, maintaining that
status until any tax deed either or both properties is/are conveyed to a potential developer. The Village
does not, at the present time, have a Third Party Request by a developer, organization or other private
party, in which the Village would convey a certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed of the
above-listed PINs to that Third Party Requestor. The Village agrees to submit, to the Cook County
Department of Planning and Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five (5)
years, or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash
Bid Ordinance. The law firm serves as Corporate Counsel to the Village of Wheeling, and will obtain the
tax deeds and bear all legal and other costs associated with acquisition of the parcels.

ASSEMBLY

TO

SUPPORT

HB2495,

THE

WHEREAS, every individual has a fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about one's own
reproductive health; and
WHEREAS, every individual who becomes pregnant has a fundamental right to continue the pregnancy
and give birth or to have an abortion; and
WHEREAS, no person who has terminated a pregnancy has made that deeply personal decision lightly;
and
WHEREAS, accessing reproductive health care is not a criminal activity; and
WHEREAS, the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health non-profit, found that women around the
world access abortion services at a statistically same rate whether they are legal and safe or illegal and
unregulated; and
WHEREAS, deaths and injuries from unsafe abortions are preventable; and
WHEREAS, marginalized individuals are disproportionately affected by abortion restrictions as they are
unable to seek safe and legal services in another country, state or county or access private care; and
WHEREAS, over the last 60 years, more than 30 countries have changed their laws to allow for greater
access to abortion in recognition of its vital role in protecting women’s lives and health; and
135

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 6, 2019

WHEREAS, in 1973 the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade to protect legal rights to safe abortions; and
WHEREAS, criminalization of abortion results in a chilling effect, in which medical professionals may
apply more narrow restrictions than required by the law or in which women and girls may be deterred from
seeking health care for life-threatening complications due to unsafe abortions or other pregnancy issues;
and
WHEREAS, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women (CEDAW, or the Treaty for the Rights of Women), has consistently stated that restrictive abortion
laws constitute discrimination against women; and
WHEREAS, under international human rights law, everyone has a right to life, health, and to be free from
violence, discrimination, and torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that being forced into
illegal, unsafe abortions constitutes a violation therein; and
WHEREAS, nearby states with restrictive laws are also served by Illinois’ safeguards and as of 2017, about
5,500 out-of-state women had the procedure performed in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, in 2017, Illinois legislators passed a law that was signed into law by then Republican Gov.
Bruce Rauner requiring state health insurance and Medicaid to cover abortions; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Reproductive Health Act (IRHA) establishes and protects the fundamental right
to safe and legal reproductive health care including contraceptives, maternal care and abortion care; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA protects all personal choices individuals may make about their reproductive health,
including the right to choose or refuse birth control, the right to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth,
and the right to choose or refuse abortion; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA codifies current standards of medical best practices on who can perform abortions
and prescribe non-surgical abortion-related medications; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA regulates clinics that perform abortions like all other medical clinics; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA finally repeals the decades-old Illinois Abortion Law of 1975 and the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act, which, though currently enjoined by courts, established criminal penalties for
performing an abortion and providing certain types of contraceptives, and allowed a husband to prevent his
wife from having an abortion; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA amends the Illinois Insurance Code to ensure that private insurance companies will
also cover health care costs for services related to abortion, adding to already required coverage related to
contraception, infertility treatments, and maternity care; and
WHEREAS, we must ensure fundamental health care protections for future generations of women and
safeguard the reproductive rights of women in Illinois and beyond; and

136

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 6, 2019

WHEREAS, protections provided by Roe v. Wade is under increasing threat in states across the country
including in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Georgia and Missouri; and
WHEREAS, these state laws may lead to a US Supreme Court challenge of Roe. V. Wade, that may
overturn federal protections; and
WHEREAS, should Roe v. Wade be overturned, the provisions of Illinois’ restrictive Abortion Law of
1975 and Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act will go into effect; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA was filed with the Clerk as H.B. 2495 by Representative Kelly M. Cassidy, with
Chief Co-Sponsors including Representative Sara Feigenholtz, Representative Emanuel Chris Welch,
Representative Marcus C. Evans, Jr., Representative Jehan Gordon-Booth and 35 additional co-sponsors;

of Commissioners do hereby recognize the need to keep abortion and reproductive health care safe and
accessible; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the Illinois General
Assembly to pass H.B. 2495 of the 101st General Assembly, also known as the Illinois Reproductive Health
Act, and support it in any manner possible to ensure residents can continue to be able to practice their
fundamental rights to choose their reproductive futures.
