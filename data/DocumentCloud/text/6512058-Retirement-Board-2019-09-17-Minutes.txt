 An Insurance Proposal Exclusively for:

Laborers & Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity & Benefit
Fund of Chicago

Fiduciary Liability Insurance Coverage Summary:
2019 Presentation

Presented: September, 2019

Presented by:
Craig Goesel
Senior Vice President
Clayton Casale
Account Manager
This proposal is prepared for the confidential use of our clients. All rights reserved. No part of this proposal may be
reproduced in any form or by any means without the prior written permission of Mesirow Insurance Services Inc.

Mesirow Insurance Services, Inc.,
an Alliant-owned company

 Executive Summary
Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. appreciates the
opportunity to present our Management Liability
insurance capabilities to Laborer’s &
Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity &
Benefit Fund of Chicago.

We author articles on management liability and the
exposures faced by the public sector, we continually
keep abreast of public pension issues and consult
with our clients on those issues as it relates to
insurance exposures and risk management and
finally, we are regular speakers at conferences
regarding risk management for pension fund trustees
for both NASRA and NCPERS.

Alliant’s experience with large public entity
exposures and the development of group purchase
programs dates back to 1977 when our public entity
division was established. Over the past 40 years we
have become a nationally recognized leader in this
specialized market sector.

Below is a limited list of retirement system clients,
demonstrating our experience:

As we developed a variety of programs for the
public sector we knew that our model and concept
could be duplicated nationally for management
liability coverage of retirement systems.







As a result, we created the first ever fiduciary and
management liability program in the country
designed to allow systems to band together and drive
down the insurance marketplace in addition to
leveraging broader coverage than what typically can
be obtained as a standalone entity.



Our strategic alliance with both NASRA and
NCPERS allow their members to access our
exclusive program; resulting in significant savings to
some of the largest systems in the country.












We understand the complexity of retirement
exposures and are leading experts in designing
coverage that is specifically tailored for our clients’
needs. We have an entire claims division that
handles claim situations that arise.

Waiver of Recourse
With the enactment of ERISA in 1974, Trustees of employee benefit plans became personally liable for their acts
on behalf of the participants of those plans. Fiduciary Liability Policies became very popular, but ERISA only
allowed the Trust Funds themselves to purchase insurance to protect the funds - not the respective trustees.
Therefore, a nominal fee was charged directly to the Trustees as a way to circumvent this provision.
Although Public Pension Funds are not subject to ERISA law, the various state pension codes often follow in the
“spirit of ERISA”. In addition, as the Fiduciary Liability policies were originally drafted to protect ERISA plans,
the waiver provision followed across Non-ERISA plans.
With that said, we have been successful in petitioning the carriers to waive their recourse to the trustees without
having to charge, unless there is a requirement within the respective governing code. As Public Pension Codes
typically have no such provision, we no longer need to charge the trustees for the waiver of recourse. The trustees
still retain the same full coverage as provided in the past.

Compensation
Alliant Insurance Services, LLC is compensated for our risk management, insurance placement, marketing, policy
issuance and other insurance services for this insurance program using a commission based compensation plan.
As the different carriers provide distinct commission schedules, we have outlined the standard commission
schedules from carriers that provide this insurance coverage. However, Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. has
agreed to reduce our compensation by 10% for the benefit of combined marketing of the Chicago Public Pension
Funds programs. Please note that commissions paid do not influence our recommendations for coverage

Fiduciary Liability Insurance
For Public Pension Funds
Trustees and staff members of governmental,
municipal and quasi-governmental pension plans
face increased exposure in their fiduciary roles.
Allegations of breaches of duty are costly to defend,
and may result in personal liability of the trustees.
Alliant Insurance Services experts provide the
following summary of typical fiduciary liabilities,
and offer solutions to lessen your fiduciary exposure.

INSURANCE AUTHORIZATION &
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS
Each board and pension fund is often authorized to
purchase insurance to protect against liability of
trustees, staff and employees which may arise as a
result of claims.
State Pension Codes generally permit, but do not
guarantee, the indemnification of trustees and
employees of the Fund – however, this
indemnification is provided for allegations other
than willful misconduct or gross negligence
(properly structured insurance programs will not
exclude allegations of willful misconduct or gross
negligence).

PENSION CODE STANDARDS & FIDUCIARY
DUTIES
The fiduciary duties under most State Pension Codes
mirror standards similar to those outlined in ERISA.
These duties include acting solely in the interest of
the participants & beneficiaries, adhering to the socalled “prudent investor” standard and other
provisions of the State Pension Code.

IN SUMMARY
ENFORCING PROVISIONS & LIMITATIONS
ON LIABILITY

State Pension Codes require fiduciaries to adhere to
many of the same standards outlined in ERISA.
Breaches of established fiduciary duties may
translate into personal liability for the trustees of
public pension funds. These same Pension Codes
allow for the purchase of insurance to protect the
plan, the trustees and the staff from such liability.

State Pension Codes, and ERISA law, typically
provide that participants, beneficiaries, fiduciaries
and/or the Attorney General may bring suits to
enforce fiduciary duties and other provisions of the
respective Pension Code.

Our professionals at Alliant Insurance Services, Inc.
are experienced in prudently structuring
comprehensive fiduciary liability insurance
programs to provide trustees with added protection
in their roles as fiduciaries of public pension funds.

These Pension Codes often do not provide
limitations, or at least not complete limitations, on
liability. They also make clear that litigation against
fiduciaries is permissible. Fiduciaries that breach
their duty can be held personally liable to make good
to such Fund any losses resulting from such breach.

All coverages and exclusions are not included on this page. Please refer to policy for all applicable terms and conditions. Additional limits and/or changes
may be available after review and acceptance by insurer.

Public Act 97-0651 (House Bill 3813):
We reference the below as an example of changing legislation that can affect the responsibilities, and therefore
liabilities, of Trustees. The below is an amendment to the responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries by the IL
State Pension Code. As the Fiduciary Liability policy is intended to cover board members (and employees) for
breaches of these stated responsibilities, defense coverage would be provided for alleged breaches of such
duties/responsibilities.
Public Act 97-0651 Further amends the Illinois Pension Code. Provides that any reasonable suspicion by any
appointed board member of a retirement system created under the Code of a false statement/record being
submitted or permitted by a person under the Code shall be immediately referred to the board of trustees or the
State's Attorney of the jurisdiction where the alleged fraudulent activity occurred. The board of trustees of this
retirement system or shall immediately notify the State's Attorney of the jurisdiction where any alleged fraudulent
activity occurred for investigation

Claim Reporting
The ramification of the current insurance market
condition from the claims prospective is that
insurance carriers are much stricter in claims being
reported promptly. Therefore, we recommend all of
our clients inform us (or your appropriate carrier) as
soon as possible when first made aware of an
incident, accident, lawsuit, or circumstance which
could give rise to a claim.

These comprehensive forms along with Claim

also contact our claim department who will assist in

Phone: 312.595.6200 (avalable 24/7)
Fax: 312.595.6506

and offer less than 100% of what is due.

Prompt claim reporting begins with the immediate
