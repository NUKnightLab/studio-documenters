GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Office of Information Technology Services is responsible for ensuring that the Chicago
Housing Authority’s (“CHA”) technical infrastructure and essential applications are
continuously maintained to support the agency’s operations. Prudent business practices dictate
having maintenance and service agreements in place to ensure critical business functions are
maintained in good working order on an ongoing basis and restored quickly and efficiently in
the event of a disruption or other impact.
The CHA issued Invitation for Bid (“IFB”) #01446 on February 23, 2006. This IFB
competitively solicited qualified firms and/or individuals who could provide Cisco equipment
maintenance to the CHA. On March 21, 2006, eight responses were received. Of the eight
received, two were deemed nonresponsive, due to a failure to accurately respond to the specified
scope of services.
In May of 2006, the CHA entered into a maintenance contract with Sentinel Technologies for
Cisco Maintenance Services. The contract was awarded for the firm fixed price of $410,265.00
for a two (2) year base term, with the option of three (3) one (1) year term extensions. The one
year term extension options were fixed at an amount not to exceed $208,736.00 per extension
year.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his/her designee, to exercise the third one (1) year option extension with Sentinel
Technologies for the period of June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011 for an amount of $208,736.00
to provide Cisco Equipment Maintenance. The Contract’s new aggregate amount will be
$1,035,964.00.
