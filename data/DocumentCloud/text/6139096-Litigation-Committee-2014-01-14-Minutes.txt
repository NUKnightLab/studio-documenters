Good Morning Chairman Sufferdin and Honorable Commissioners.

My name is Jose Dimas and it gives me great honor to stand before you
today.

I ask for your support of my appointment to the Central Stickney
Sanitary District?s trustee position.

I have lived in the Central Stickney area for the last 37 years and raised
my children there. I am fortunate to have my daughter and my
grandchildren also living in this community.

For the past 25 years I have worked as a leadman for TW Metals in
Carol Stream.

If I am appointed to the Central Stickney Sanitary District I will work
to familiarize myself with the operations of the District and make sure
the District is run efficiently, transparent and cost effective.

I believe my Hispanic heritage gives me the opportunity to serve and
represent the ever-growing Hispanic population of Central Stickney.

Thank you for your consideration and I will accept questions at this
time.

Statement to the Cook County Board
Anthony A. Iosco
January 15, 2014

I would like to thank the Board for giving me the opportunity to serve the
people of Cook County as a member of the Cook County Zoning Board oprpeals.
Service to the community is a vital part of a rich and productive life. I have learned
this over the years, as I have been fortunate to serve as a member of the Circuit
Court of Cook County as well as a Trustee for Northern Illinois University.

Justice and fundamental fairness were the cornerstones of my judicial
philosophy, and I am eager to apply those principles to zoning matters. I believe
zoning is an important tool to help any community continue to advance and thrive.
A methodical and thoughtful approach fosters this progress and ensures that all
citizens feel that their concerns and interests have been considered.

As a lifelong resident of Cook County, I am excited about utilizing my 35
years of experience as a lawyer and a judge to help our County continue its
evolution and advancement.

Thank you.
