West Lemoyne Street from North Kildare Avenue to North Tripp Avenue; Single

motorists on North Tripp Avenue would reach a dead-end at West Le Moyne without a
turnaround location if West Le Moyne Street, east of North Kildare Avenue, was
converted to a one-way eastbound road. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend

TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS SIGNALS:

West 59th Street and South Komensky Avenue; Two Way Stop Sign. Not
Recommended. West 59th Street is a major collector roadway with significantly higher
traf?c volumes than South Komensky Avenue, a one way northbound residential
street. Stop signs on streets with higher volumes such as West 59th Street tend to
increase rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of security
for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Stop compliance is particularly low at T-
intersections. Additionally, due to this intersection's proximity to the traf?c signal at
West 59th Street and South Pulaski Road, a stop sign at South Komensky Avenue will
be unexpected for drivers. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All Way Stop
Sign at this intersection -- (18-01731514) [Or2018?254]

West 95th Street and South Eggleston Street; Stop Sign, Stopping east and
westbound traffic on West 95th Street. Not Recommended. West 95th Street is a
major arterial roadway with significantly higher traffic volumes than South
Eggleston Avenue, a local street. Stop signs on streets with higher volumes
such as West 95th Street tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase
congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every
vehicle will stop. Stop compliance is particularly low at T-intersections.
Additionally, there is an existing pedestrian refuge island on West 95th Street
at the south leg of South Eggleston Street that allows pedestrians to cross
traffic one direction at a time. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All
Way Stop Sign at this intersection -- (18-01381289) [Or2018?189]

Not Recommended. CDOT does not recommend stop signs on the main line of T-

proximity to the traffic signal at West 5?h Avenue and South Sacramento Boulevard.
motorists will likely speed to catch the green light and disregard the slop sign
