GENERAL BACKGROUND

Waiting List Occupancy Process for All Three Develogments

It is the intent of each ownerfmanager at these properties to lease all of their units to eligible
persons from waiting lists. Eligibility for each property includes being below 50%of
AMI and having a diagnosed mental illness. To accomplish this, we will utilize a cross-
referenced list of Thresholds applicants and CHA applicants as well as a cross referenced list of
Williams consent decree class members and CHA applicants. In addition, CHA will be updating
all of its waiting lists to ensure that people interested in housing with these services are also
referred to the property for eligibility. In the event that an insuf?cient number of applicants are
identi?ed through the cross?referencing process after 90 days of referrals to a vacant unit,
Thresholds may qualify applicants from its site-based waiting list. The CHA waiting list of
applicants or current participants that are also interested in housing that provides mental health
services will be exhausted prior to utilization of a site based waiting list.
