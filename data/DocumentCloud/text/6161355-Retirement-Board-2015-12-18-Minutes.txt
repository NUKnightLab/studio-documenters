Trustee Hauser requested motions on Board orders submitted by the Board’s legal counsel. In the
matter of Doris Gaskew, the Board found that Officer Gaskew is not entitled to a duty disability
benefit as her duty injury has resolved prior to her exhausting her medical leave and therefore
entitled to receive an ordinary disability benefit effective February 17, 2015 through November
30, 2015, at which time the ordinary benefit ceased as she is no longer disabled.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Lappe that the Board adopt the order on
Doris Gaskew as submitted.

adopt the order on Karen Wojcikowski as submitted.
