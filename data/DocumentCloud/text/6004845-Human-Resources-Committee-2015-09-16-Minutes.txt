III.

Report from Chief of Human Resources (Attachment #1)
Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources, provided an overview of the report, which included information on the
following subjects:
Comparison of Vacancies Filled;
Vacancies Filled by Quarter;
Internal and External Vacancies Filled;
Licensed Nurse Vacancies Filled;
FY2015 Separations and Hires;
CCHHS Turnover through 08/31/15;
CCHHS FY2015 Turnover by New Hires; and
FY2015 HR Goal: Improve/Reduce Average Time to Hire.
With regard to the information on vacancies filled on Slide 2 of the presentation, Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief
Executive Officer, noted that, on the line for the data on Physicians, the Increase/Decrease column should reflect a
decrease of 12, not 8.
The Committee discussed the subject of vacancies filled and Request To Hires (RTHs) in process for Finance
positions. Board Chairman Hammock noted that there has been a tremendous increase in the number of vacancies
filled this year; he wondered what that number might have been a year ago. Ms. Lopez responded that she will
look into the question; she noted that the focus this year was on insourcing. For the data relating to the Finance
Department, a great number of those positions are newly created; in past years, a lot of the work had been done by
contractors, and might be difficult to compare, but she will check. Board Chairman Hammock stated that an
important piece of information needed is the total number of positions in the department, in comparison to the
Page 1 of 28

 III. Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
number of RTHs in process; for example, 85 RTHs in process is __% of the total Finance staff. Director Collens
suggested that a column be added that lists the total number of positions; this would provide that perspective.
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided additional information relating
to the structure of the Finance Department. He stated that Finance is a divisional name - in addition to the
traditional Finance Department positions, it includes all of the registration, pre-registration and billing positions.
He can provide further information and break down the pieces within Finance in a memorandum to the
Committee.
During the discussion of the subject of nurse recruitment, a question was raised regarding recruitment activities
with nursing schools. Ms. Lopez stated that staff have identified specific individuals at some nursing schools that
are notified when CCHHS positions are vacant, so they can post it on their websites. Staff are trying to expand
those efforts, specifically with nursing. Director Gugenheim inquired whether those types of activities also take
place at graduate schools. Ms. Lopez responded in the negative; she stated that it is a good suggestion and she
will look further into it.
During the discussion of turnover data on slide 9, a question was raised regarding whether the number of
separations at Cermak Health Services is considered to be high. Ms. Lopez recalled that the number of
separations overall has remained stable, but will look into the question further.
Chairman Wiese inquired whether information can be obtained regarding the number of staff who are in the
process of submitting information for their retirements for December. Ms. Lopez responded that the
administration does not receive information on retirements until the employee is leaving; she stated that she will
contact the Pension Board to see if they have seen an increase in the number of employees who have reached out
to them from CCHHS.
