Public Comments
Deb Mell (Alderman 33rd ward): Roosevelt HS is in the 33rd ward. She attended the
Haugan meeting last week and felt it was positive. Feels supporting local schools is
essential. Voiced concern for teacher positions that will be lost at Roosevelt and hopeful
that teachers will be assisted in finding new positions, possibly given priority at Haugan
and Henry.
Januario Gutierrez (Principal at Henry) - Very excited to potentially expand. This has
been a hope for Henry for a long time.
Dan Kramer (Principal at Roosevelt) - Here to speak support for all three schools. Says
it is important to note that there are exemplary teachers and students in middle school

 at Roosevelt and want to continue to support those families. Excited about what is
offered at Roosevelt and is always looking to support students in the community.
Luis Avila (AP Haugan Elementary): He is in support of adding 7th and 8th grade to
Haugan. Said Haugan has worked hard to provide a high quality education for their
students and can continue the coherence of learning by providing a middle school that
can successfully transition students to high school.
Sharyzid Baldoky (president of LSC @ Henry) - Wants everyone to know that this is an
excellent school. The programs at Henry are high quality, the school is safe, and she is
happy to not have to look for a new school after 6th grade. Her daughter, who has
autism, has received a great education and she is excited at the possibility of staying at
Henry.
Steve Livingston (retired CPS teacher) - Has serious reservations about the proposal. It
appears to fit in with real estate trends in the neighborhood. Newer more expensive
homes may result in families moving out and therefore not attending Roosevelt. He
states it appears the Board and City would like the neighborhood to go this way and is
not as concerned with the quality of education for the families, much like how schools
are being closed in Englewood.
Clara Velazquez (mother of Henry students) - Her children likes it at Henry and they are
excited to possibly have them stay here.
Neal Resnikoff (Albany Park Neighbors for Peace and Justice) - Says there seems to be
an effort to stop public education and to give schools to private organizations. To empty
Roosevelt HS is part of a pattern. Private schools are interested in making a profit off
the students. We should oppose any proposal that reduces Roosevelt's enrollment.
J.Q. (6th grade student at Henry) - Wants to have 7th grade at Henry so that it will not
be hard to adjust at Roosevelt and a big high school. Is worried about high school
bullying for a 7th grader. Also Henry is closer to his house and not as far as Roosevelt.
Y.R. (Henry student) - Wants 7th grade because teachers are good at Henry.
A.B. (Henry student) - Wants to have 7th grade because teachers at Henry are good.
Does not want to travel to HS and doesnâ€™t want parents to have to look for new schools.
T.R. (Henry parent) - In favor of proposal since it is closer, and the school is good.

 Lourdes Benitez (parent 1st and 3rd grader at Henry) -- Moved back from suburbs and
took a gamble on Henry but was concerned about no 7th and 8th grade. Her daughters
like Henry because of the excellent teachers. Believes there is wonderful staff. Thinks
students at Henry are at a disadvantage without middle school. Roosevelt is not
necessarily receiving these student so they are not ready to make a school choice or
navigate that process.
Lisa Cantu (Henry teacher) - Says teachers work hard at Henry and is in favor of middle
school.
D.G. (6th grader at Henry) - His little sister is a 1st grader and it is easier for his family
to be at the same school longer. Henry is like a second home to him, the teachers are
very helpful. He can walk his sister home for an additional 2 years.
Katherine Prasko Holod (Henry teacher) - Product of CPS, alumni of Roosevelt, 24 year
CPS teacher. In favor of proposal. 7th and 8th graders will have leadership
opportunities at Henry and that will benefit the school.
J.B. (6th grade Henry student) - In favor - Says Henry taught her well through
personalized learning.
S.L. (6th grade Henry student) - In favor - Says Henry is like a second home. Henry has
shown her how to build independence through personalized learning.
B.F. (6th grade Henry student) First year at Henry. In favor. Says she feels safe at
Henry and enjoys the personalized learning.
J.E. (6th grade student) - In favor - She is worried about being distracted by bad
behavior at Roosevelt HS.

siblings are at Henry.

8th grade here. She knows it will be a big challenge but also knows the school will do a
great job.

Says so many community members have shown up to support and they want this to
pass. Says they have proven their worth with the SQRP score.

in 6th grade knowing she would have to switch schools and did not understand why.
Feels teachers were amazing and always went to the extra mile. Never felt the same
way again.
Y.P. (6th grade Henry student) - In favor. The school has helped her through a lot of
issues. After school Ms. Rodriguez helped her to dance.
Kayla Jaffe (DL teacher at Henry, 1st year) - Has been supported by school teachers,
admin, and families. In favor, since the transition to an outside middle school is very
hard on students, especially students with diverse learner needs.
M.V(Henry student) - In favor.
Maryanne Munozmacel (AP at Henry) - She is proud of students, teachers, and parents
for voicing their opinions here tonight. A pillar at Henry is to voice your choice and it is
wonderful to see them demonstrate that tonight. Thank you for letting us voice or
opinion.

parents and intervene to avoid potential incidents after school.

this school is.

new classmates in middle school. Would miss favorite teachers.
AJ Taylor (community rep on Roosevelt LSC) - Says great work being done at Henry
and great work being done at Roosevelt. Roosevelt presents a great opportunity like
being able to offer middle school students advanced courses so they are ahead of track
for college. He hopes the LSC can build a strong relationship with LSC at Haugan and
Henry.
