PROJECT OVERVIEW

From the Spring of 2017 through
Summer 2018, CDOT will be working
with community members to identify
traffic and safety improvements that will
make Milwaukee Avenue from West
Logan Boulevard to Belmont Avenue

more user-friendly.

 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This includes potential updates to
Logan Square, building off the Logan
Square Bicentennial Improvements
Project. We will seek to maintain the
Square’s historic integrity while
balancing the needs of the area’s

diverse residents, businesses, and
commuters.

 Study Goals
North Milwaukee Avenue is a local and regional street for
multiple modes of transportation. It is officially zoned and
functions as a Pedestrian Street southeast of Diversey.
The key goals of this study are to:
Create public
space and
improve walkability

Achieve Vision
Zero* by enhancing
traffic safety and
access to the area

Harmonize the
various modes
of transportation

*Vision Zero will reduce the number of roadway crashes with the goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries in Chicago by 2026.
