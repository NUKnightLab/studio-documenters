There was further discussion concerning results of the Audit and Actuarial Committee meeting. The
Fund’s Audit and Actuarial Committee did not make a decision on the actuarial firm to be retained for the
2017 valuation, but rather requested that the Executive Director contact the appropriate representative from
Gabriel, Roeder, Smith and Company (GRS) and discuss the service concerns noted at the meeting on
November 9, 2017.
The Executive Director indicated that she contacted Judith Kermans, the President of GRS, and discussed
the matters of concern. Ms. Tuczak indicated that Ms. Kerman was very interested in GRS adequately
addressing the concerns of the Audit and Actuarial Committee and the Fund’s staff, and suggested some
service alternatives that may improve the matters discussed. Based upon the suggestions discussed and the
interest expressed by Ms. Kermans in improving the service, timelines and communication of GRS, Ms.
Tuczak recommended that GRS be retained for actuarial services in 2017, however, engagement for
services beyond 2018 would be assessed later, after completion of the 2017 actuarial valuation and related
services.
It was moved by Trustee Wodnicki, seconded by Trustee Wright that the Board approve retaining GRS for
the 2017 valuation.

September 18, 1995, through May 2, 1997, at which time he was employed as an Investigator for the City
of Chicago Office of the Inspector General. As the statutory provision of the Act does not grant police
pension credit for such service, Gallagher's request for police pension service credit for all or part of the
time period requested is therefore denied."

The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

The first item was a draft of 2018 meeting schedule. This was to be reviewed, any requested
changes forwarded to the Executive Director, for approval at the December Board meeting

•

The next item was reporting that the Richard J. Jones Annuitants Assistance Fund (RJJAAF) met
to review the issuance of a $500 gift check to the Fund’s minimum annuitants, including widows.
The Executive Director requested on behalf of the RJJAAF that $490,000 be transferred from the

to the identified recipients.

President Hauser presented to the RJJAAF a check for $500 from the proceeds of the FOP Auxiliary,
Pension Fund and Detective Association Golf Outing.
•

The next item discussed was the annual ethics training certification. In January of each year, this
Fund has to certify to the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation that the Trustees have
completed the eight hours of training required by the Illinois Pension Statutes per Article 1. The
Executive Director thus requests that each Trustee review and sign the certification presented so
there is a record from which the appropriate documents can be filed.

•

The next item was a request from the Executive Director for each Trustee to check their calendars
for a one-on-one meeting to review the drafted 2018 Administrative Budget for the Fund. The
Budget is scheduled to be approved at the December Board meeting. Before formal presentation
for approval, the Executive Director meets with each Trustee to review and answer any questions or
concerns.

•

There was a review of the matters scheduled for the December Board meeting. Following the
December Board meeting, the Executive Director requested the Fund host its annual holiday party.
The Executive Director requested a budget of $550 for this year’s holiday party.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Hamburger that the Board approve $600 for the

The Executive Director informed the Board of Public Act 100-0023, which was passed in July of
this year. Essentially, there is assignment of receipt language that indicates that revenues of the
State can be assigned to a specific trust that would be for the benefit of bondholders of the City.
Interceptor language specific to the Fund in previous legislation may be impacted as this Act
provides protections for bondholders on revenues from the State, which may move the Pension
Funds lower on receipt of State revenues in the event the interceptor function was necessary.

•

The last item concerns a request of a retiree to have healthcare deductions made from his pension
for an insurance plan other than those previously allowed by the Board. At interest is the $3,000
public safety officer tax deduction that could be utilized if the Fund were to directly deduct the
premium from the member’s pension to pay the provider directly, as required by the tax code.
After lengthy discussion of various matters related to the implementation of such requests, it was
determined that Fund staff would honor each retirees’ written request on a one-by-one basis and
report back to the Board if the volume of such requests significantly increases.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT CONCLUDED
Board counsel reviewed with the Board the matter of the Sergeant’s Association vs. Pallohusky. The
Appellate court found that former Sergeant Pallohusky is entitled to keep his widower’s annuity as the
surviving spouse of a deceased police officer. Therefore the monies which the Fund was holding are to be
released to him per order of the court.
It was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Beyna that the Board comply with the
requirement of the Appellate Court.
