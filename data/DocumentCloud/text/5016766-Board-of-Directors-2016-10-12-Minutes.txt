PROJECTS
St. Charles Place Lofts Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg stated that a Single Business Tax “credit-only” Brownfield Plan (the “Plan”)
for the former St. Charles School building was approved by the DBRA on September 17,
2003, by the Detroit City Council on November 14, 2003 and the Mayor of the City of

 Detroit on November 24, 2003. The Plan failed to occur and the developer, English
Village Lofts, LLC no longer controls the property. DBRA staff were unable to find any
approvals of the Plan by the MEDC, nor were they able to find any additional approved
contracts or agreements that may be associated with the Plan.
Act 381 permits Plans to be terminated if they failed to occur within 5 years of approval.
Termination of this Plan will clear the parcels listed in the Plan for future Brownfield Plans
more in line with a current development plan. Board members had a brief discussion
about what was proposed in the Plan and what was known about why the project failed
to occur,
Mr. Walters called for a motion recommending termination of the Plan to City Council as
well as any other agreements or contracts that may be associated with the Plan. The
Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. DeSantis, seconded by Mr. Sanders, DBRA Resolution Code
16-10-57-02 was unanimously approved.

St. Charles School Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the St. Charles School Brownfield Redevelopment Plan. Mr.
Vosburg noted that City Council staff has not yet provided a letter qualifying 1432-1444
Townsend as Blighted, however a letter is underway and the three parcels automatically
qualify as blighted per Act 381 of 1996, as amended, due to the fact that they are tax
reverted and/or owned by the Detroit Land Bank Authority.
Mr. Aamir Farooqi and Mrs. Elizabeth Masserang presented additional information
regarding the project and answered various questions from board members regarding
compliance with Executive Orders, expected rental rates, and the developer’s prior real
estate development experience.
Project Introduction
FSI 4, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails the
rehabilitation of the vacant former St. Charles School, which is next door to St. Charles
Borromeo Catholic Church, into a 27-unit loft-style rental building which will include a new
construction fourth floor. A new construction 11-unit two-story townhome building will be
built directly to the south of the school building on what are four vacant lots. One, two
and three bedroom units will be created, with 8 of the 11 new construction townhomes
reserved as affordable units for renters with incomes below 80% of the area median
income (AMI). The parking areas of the development will be located away from the street
view and have green storm water features.
Approximately 5 permanent full time equivalent jobs and 100 temporary construction jobs
are expected to be created as a result of the project. The total investment is estimated
to exceed $8.3 million. The Developer is requesting $851,295 in TIF reimbursement.

 Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) is located at 1432-1454 Townsend Street, five
parcels on the eastside of Townsend Street between St. Paul and Agnes Streets in the
Islandview Village neighborhood of Detroit, just east of East Grand Boulevard and just
north of East Jefferson Avenue near Belle Isle.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized for a commercial and/or residential purpose; (b) it
is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and
(c) the Property is determined to be functionally obsolete, blighted and/or adjacent to or
contiguous to an eligible parcel and is estimated to increase the captured taxable value
of that property as defined by Act 381. 1454 Townsend, the former school building, has
been certified functionally obsolete by a level 3 or level 4 assessor, a letter to that effect
can be found in Attachment D of the Plan. The three vacant lots identified as 1432, 1438
and 1444 Townsend are owned by the Detroit Land Bank Authority and thus automatically
qualify as blighted per Act 381, the initial determination of blight letter is pending from
Detroit City Planning Commission staff. The parcel identified as 1450 Townsend is
adjacent and contiguous to eligible parcels at 1444 and 1454 Townsend Street.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, infrastructure
improvements, site preparation, and development and preparation of a brownfield plan
and/or work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the
development of the Property and will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority
is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The eligible
activities are estimated to begin in fall/winter of 2016 and complete within eighteen (18)
months.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.
COSTS TO BE REIMBURSED WITH TIF
1. Phase I ESA
2. Demolition
3. Lead & Asbestos Abatement
4. Infrastructure Improvements

6. Brownfield Plan & Act 381 Work Plan

reimbursement from tax increment revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be
governed by the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Other Development Incentives
The Developer of this Plan will seek additional support through a Commercial
Rehabilitation Act Abatement (PA 210).
Attached for your review and approval is a resolution authorizing the St. Charles Place
Brownfield Plan for submittal to the Community Advisory Committee.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the transmittal of the Brownfield Plan to the
Community Advisory Committee as well as to conduct a public hearing for the Plan for
the St. Charles School Brownfield Redevelopment Plan.
On a motion by Ms. DeSantis, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code
16-10-241-01 was unanimously approved.

ADMINISTRATIVE
Environmental Assessment Grant Awards
Mr. Vosburg reviewed the history of the EPA Funds transferred from the City and informed
the board that over 50 projects totaling nearly $900,000 in funding requests applied for
the EPA Environmental Assessment grant funds during the one-week application window.
Due to the overwhelming response to the grant funds and the limited time to review
proposals and obligate funds, DBRA staff are recommending that the Board approve
applicants on a first come, first served policy. Descriptions of twelve projects totaling
$220,500, listed in order of receipt, were presented to the board for approval.
Mr. Scott stated that applicants being considered for approval may not end up expending
all the grant funds being requested and approved. Mr. Scott recommended having
conditional awards for additional applicants in the event that all the funds are not
expended by the first twelve applicants.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the awarding of EPA Assessment Grant Awards
on a first come, first served policy; awarding the first twelve projects in order of receipt
totaling $220,500; as well as approving conditional awards for additional applicants. The
Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Griffie, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code 1610-01-173, was unanimously approved.
