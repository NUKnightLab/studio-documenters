Illinois residents have an opportunity to share their thoughts on services and programs funded through

Health Services (PHHS) Block Grant provides all 50 states with funding to address their unique public
health needs in innovative and locally-defined ways. Grantees use these funds to respond rapidly to
emerging health issues, fill gaps in programs that deal with leading causes of death and disability and
support local efforts to achieve healthy communities. The Illinois Department of Public Health, Office
of Health Promotion, is the designated state recipient of the Preventive Health and Health Services
Block Grant funds. Programs and services supported by the grant include primary prevention and
health promotion efforts associated with improving nutrition, early hearing detection interventions, the
Illinois Project for the Local Assessment of Needs (IPLAN), county-level Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance (BRFSS), the State Health Improvement Plan, Illinois Pregnancy Risk Assessment
Monitoring System (PRAMS), and the Sexual Assault Set-Aside.
