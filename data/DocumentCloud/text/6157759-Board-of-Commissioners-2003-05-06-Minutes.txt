RUDOLPH SANCHEZ, Director, President's Office of Employment Training
requesting authorization to accept $3,000,000.00 from the Federal Department of Labor for an H-1 B
Information Skills Technology Grant to upgrade the skills of incumbent workers. Allstate and
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) are primary partners in the grant. Allstate is in the
process of reorganizing to become predominantly a full financial services company. Similarly, IBM is
currently reorganizing to shift its focus from providing hardware to providing technology consulting
services. Both companies will provide critical IT training to incumbent workers. By upgrading the skills
of current employees, these workers will fill positions within these companies that otherwise would have
to be filled by foreign nationals, due to American 's skill sho11age in these IT fields.
The DOIT network, a group of small minority owned Information Technology (IT) companies, will train
incumbent workers employed by their companies. These companies would then be in a position to hire
new trainees from POET's pool of dislocated workers that have limited skills and experience to take the
place of the incumbent workers who have been upgraded.
It is expected that this project will provide critical IT training skills to 700 incumbent workers. In order to
commence activities, permission is also requested to subcontract a portion of the funds to the following
compames:

Submitting a request from
DA YID WEBB, JR., Mayor, City of Markham
Re:

No Cash Bid Program
Scavenger Sale of Tax Delinquent Property

The City of Markham, Illinois, would like to take advantage of the no-cash-bid process of the Cook
County Board in acquiring various tax delinquent parcels of real property here in the city. I respectfully
request an opportunity to participate in that process, at the next Scavenger Sale of tax delinquent
prope1ties.
As required under the Cook County No Cash Bid Program and the municipal application checklist for tax
delinquent property, the City of Markham hereby submits the following information in support of its No
Cash Bid request as referenced above:
I.

Cover letter. I suggest that this correspondence be considered the cover letter.

2.

Certified Resolution. A certified copy of Resolution No. 02-R-199 of the City of Markham,
Illinois, with the required inclusions is submitted.

3.

Current judgment search showing current owner by Guaranty National Title Company, 36 West
Randolph Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60601 , for the properties in question.

4.

Sidwell Map. Copies of the Sidwell maps showing the location of the properties in question.

5.

Photographs. Photographs of the properties are submitted hereto, all properties being vacant.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 6, 2003

Third Party Requestor. A third party is requesting the bid through the City of Markham. The
Requestor is:
Columbia Properties, Ltd.
Daniel Kravetz, President
2109 South Indiana Avenue
Chicago, Illinois, 60616
See submitted affidavit.
See submitted statement suggesting capacity of the third party to complete the
development of the parcels for their intended use.

7.

Benefits. The benefits to be attained by the municipality which would be provided by the
intended use are as follows:
First and foremost the property would be restored as a real estate tax source. Abandoned and
unkempt vacant land would be enhanced with the construction of modern and efficient housing
structures. Such developments would attract residents, shoppers and businesses to the City of
Markham which would use other services provided in the vicinity. There will also be the
enhancement of infrastructure aspects of the City of Markham through construction of extended
sewer and water lines, benefiting nearby residents, many of whom are currently dependent on
septic tanks and well water. Finally, there will be an improvement in the over all appearance of
the City of Markham.

8.

Legal Counsel. The developer has undertaken to provide all needed legal assistance at its own
expense. The City of Markham does not anticipate providing any legal counsel unless it is of a
nature where the developer will reimburse the City of Markham for all such expenses.

The City of Markham will provide any additional infornrntion needed to expedite the handling of this
request.
Your reference of this matter to the Finance Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners and the favorable consideration of the Board of Commissioners will be sincerely
appreciated both by me and the people of the City of Markham.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED
COOK COUNTY JAIL INMATE ABUSE
WHEREAS, it is public policy and practice of the President and the Board of Commissioners
to protect the safety and rights of inmates as well as law enforcement officials within the
Cook County Jail System; and
WHEREAS, there has been considerable court litigation, reports, publications and public
demonstrations about alleged excessive use of force and abuse by law enforcement officials
and gang activities within Cook County Jail System; and
WHEREAS, to maintain integrity of the Cook County Jail System it is necessary that an
investigation be conducted by an independent body which has no past or present ties with the
criminal justice system in Cook County: such as universities and law schools which are more
cost effective, labor intensive, and could shorten the completion time of the investigation; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County authorize the commission of an independent investigation of Cook County Jail
System by a university or law school through the RFP process.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the RFP process clearly defines the scope of services
to be rendered which shall include but are not limited to protecting the confidentiality of all
interviewees, a clearly defined plan to minimize disruptions of day-to-day operations, and a
time certain for completion.
*Referred to the Finance Committee on March 6, 2003.
*Deferred at the March 12, 2003 Finance Committee meeting.

2.

Independent Auditor's Review of the Office of the Cook County Auditor.

Submitted to the Audit Committee on March 10, 2003.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's comments regarding the magnitude of a review of delinquent real
estate tax records in future audits, Laura Bunnan explained that the Auditor's Office had not been
involved with delinquent real estate taxes for some time. She said the Department of Revenue currently
reviews these tax records and maintains the records for thirty years.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the estimated annual percentage of delinquent
taxes, Ms. Burman stated that she did not have the information, but would forward the question to the
appropriate parties.
Commissioner Hansen asked for clarification regarding the statement "policies and procedures have not
been updated to new accounting and auditing pronouncements" .
Ms. Burman replied that accounting and auditing standards are constantly being reviewed and updated by
the Standards Board. She said her office is aware of such changes almost immediately.

1436

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 6, 2003

Cha irman Daley asked Lester McKeever, Managing Partner, Washington Pittman & McKeever to shed
light on the question.
Mr. McKeever noted that accounting pronouncements are non-static. He said the Standards Board issues
certain pronouncements from time to time that change yearly requirements in how an audit should be
approached. He noted that when changes are made, the standards should be incorporated in the
procedures manual.
In response to Chairman Daley's comment regarding incorporating these changes
manual, Laura Burman answered in the affirmative.

the procedures

In rep ly to Commissioner Hansen 's statements regarding vacancies in the Auditor's office that impact the
issuance of timely audits, Laura Burman explained that the office has brought a significant number of
audits current through the years 200 I and 2002. Ms. Burman further commented that the office is not
fu lly funded for staffing and there are a number of vacant positions. Ms. Bunnan further commented that
her office performs approximately twenty audits per year and one or two of them may be more than two
years old.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the number of 200 I audits the office is
currently working on, Dorothy Loving, Audit Supervisor explained that there are only two audits being
conducted through 2001 and the rest are being brought up to date through 2002. Ms. Loving indicated
that these audits should be complete by the next Audit committee meeting.
Commissioner Hansen noted the importance of audits to both management and to the budget-making
process. He further commented on the desirability of completing audits within twelve months of the
fiscal year-end.
Ms. Burman stated that in past years the Auditor's office was budgeted for twenty-seven staff but for the
last two years, only twenty-three positions have been budgeted. Currently there is a staff of twenty
auditors, and candidates are now being interviewed. She explained that part of the delay is due to the
Auditor's office being more efficient and part of it has to due with departmental record keeping.
Ms. Burman concluded by saying that her office is committed to the issuing of timely audit reports,
regardless of any changes in staffing levels that may or may not occur.
Commissioner Goslin suggested that the budget process may be an appropriate time to di scuss the use of
temporary or retired accountants to help reduce the Auditor's workload.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to receive and file Item 2. The
motion carried.

vehic le sales covers auction and disposal costs, Jack Kelly, Chief Financial Officer of the Sheriff's Offi ce,
replied that the fee does not cover all costs. It has been in place for three or four years at this level, and he
believes the fee should be increased to $35.00. Mr. Kelly noted that he would conduct a study to
determine how much it costs to conduct the auction and provide the information to the commissioners at a
later date.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CORRECTIONS

April 10, 2003
The Honorable,
The Board of Commissioners of Cook County
ATTENDANCE

Present:

Chairman Maldonado, Vice Chairman Silvestri and Commissioners Butler, Gorman,
Moreno and Peraica (6)

Absent:

Commissioner Quigley (1)

Also Present:

Commissioners Collins and Sims (2); Patrick Driscoll - State's Attorney's Office; Judge
Paul P. Biebel, Jr. - Presiding Judge, Cook County Criminal Courts; and James O ' Rourke
- Executive Director, Judicial Advisory Council

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Thursday, April 10, 2003 at the hour of 1:30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
of the County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois to hear testimony from Judge Paul P.
Biebel, Jr., Presiding Judge, Cook County Criminal Coui1s. Judge Biebel will speak on issues that affect
overcrowding at Cook County Jail including parole holds, parole warrants, drug courts, and lengths of
adjudication.
Chainnan Maldonado began the meeting with opening remarks to the committee. He commented that this
was the second in a series of hearings to examine overcrowding and violence at Cook County Jail. He
stated that although the Grand Jury investigation and the Sheriff's Task Force are necessary components
to comprehensive reform, he believes county commissioners must respond to a federal decree that
mandates a reduction in overcrowding and suggest meaningful refonns. The best way to suggest refonns,
Chainnan Maldonado stated, is through our county government committee structure.
Chainnan Maldonado noted that at today' s hearing Presiding Judge Paul Biebel, Jr., Cook County
Criminal Courts, would be exploring jail overcrowding from a judicial perspective. Judge Biebel would
also address parole holds, parole warrants, drug courts, and lengths of adjudication as they relate to the
jail overcrowding. James O ' Rourke, Executive Director of the Judicial Advisory Council would also
bring comments on the Cook County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council's perspective on the
overcrowding issue.

1439

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 6, 2003
In closing, Chairman Maldonado stated that the State's Attorney, the Public Defender and the Sheriffs
Office would testify on pretrial release programs and their effectiveness in reducing overcrowding at
future public hearings.

Commissioner Peraica stated that he wanted to join Chairman Maldonado and Vice Chairman Hansen in
welcoming Judge Paul Biebel and James O ' Rourke. He stated that he looks forward to a frank di scussion
of the sources of problems both from a correctional point of view, and a j udicial point of view as well as
looking at some of the administrative agencies such as the Secretary of State's Office, and other state and
federal agencies that place detainees in the Cook County correctional system. The commissioner further
noted that everyone recognizes that domestic violence and drug abuse contribute to the system, but traffic
offenses, homelessness and mental illness all contribute one way or another to the jail overcrowding and
violence being addressed today.
Commissioner Peraica commented that everyone should work together to address the common threads
that led the county to this situation, and chart a course of action that can be implemented to provide real
solutions to the problems the county is facing.
Chairman Maldonado introduced Judge Paul Biebel, Jr. for remarks.
In his remarks, Judge Biebel noted that he had
work with other officials to curb overcrowding
recent months. Judge Biebel stated that judges
related cases, and non-violent felony cases had
more efficient.

taken steps to speed up court cases while continuing to
at Cook County Jail where the population has fallen in
had been assigned to concentrate on high-volume drugbeen sent to suburban courthouses to make the system

Judge Biebel noted that Cook County judges dispose of three times as many cases as judges in Los
Angeles and five times as many cases as j udges in New York City. He stated that in an effort to better
address jail overcrowding without incurring increased costs, with the input and approval of the Chief
Judge Timothy Evans, he implemented several changes in recent months. One courtroom was
transformed into a full time drug courtroom where Judge John Fleming has been assigned. When the
courtroom opened, the judge was given fifteen drug cases per day until his docket reached six hundred
cases. He said the number of cases was later reduced to a daily docket of ten new cases. Judge Biebel
observed that it is estimated that just one drug courtroom would dispose of over 2,200 cases in the year
2003.
To increase productivity levels, Judge Biebel noted that he reassigned current and new drug cases that had
been previously assigned to judges that have retired or transferred. He stated that there are currently six
courtrooms, and each courtroom is assigned twenty-four new drug cases per week. He stated that the
judges funnel nearly 10,000 new drug cases per year.
In 2002, Judge Biebel ordered that all non-violent felony cases, including drug cases from District 25 and
8, be diverted to the seven j udges located in suburban courthouses who hear felony cases. He noted that
the number of cases in the suburban courthouses approximate those cases at 26th and California.

Judge Biebel stated that everyone is aware of the overcrowding conditions at the county jail, and that he
appears before the federal judge who oversees the Duran consent decree. He further noted that on April
9, 2003, the jail population was 10,433 , down from an average of 11 ,100 in April 2002, when Sheriff
Michael Sheahan said he would put prisoners in tents if the population reached 12,000. He stated that the
jail has I 0, 164 available beds and eighty-eight beds are in an area that is being renovated, resulting in the
jail being over populated by 269 prisoners.

1440

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 6, 2003
According to Judge Biebel some factors affecting the jail overcrowding are the 1,242 parole holds and
warrants (590 are parole holds) issued by the Illinois Department of Corrections. He said this means that
Cook County must hold the 590 prisoners and cannot release them, which is more than twice the number
of prisoners being held in Cook County Jail without beds.
Judge Biebel noted that Professor Joseph Trotter, author of an extensive study of the criminal justice
system in Cook County, which was published in 1989, is back to review, study and critique the county' s
system. Professor Trotter is from the American University in Washington, D.C. The judge said he looks
forward to Professor Trotter's assistance, recommendations and judgment in making Cook County courts
operate more efficiently.
Judge Biebel commented that, based on requests from President Stroger and Chief Judge Evans, he had
extended the tenns of the March 2003 regular Grand Jury to study and report on the conditions and
treatments of the prisoners at Cook County Jail to detennine whether any laws have been violated or
neglected including the cause of such violations or neglect. Further, Judge Biebel stated that in the future
he hopes to appoint an investigator to assist the Grand Jury.
Jn response to Commissioner Peraica's comments, Judge Biebel observed that Cook County has been
innovative in terms of dealing with drug cases. The county has a model drug court and officials are
looking at funding sources for both mental illness and drug issues. He stated that it has been estimated
that forty percent of the Cook County Jail population has a diagnosable mental illness. He stated that he
hopes to treat mental illness first, and then drug abuse cases. Finally, he noted that jail officials are also
looking to institute more diversionary drug programs.
Commissioner Butler read statements from a Court Watchers Report into the record, and noted that the
article had been sent to President Stroger and Chief Judge Evans. Judge Biebel commented that he has
the report and that the concerns outlined in the report are the same issues he will be addressing.

In response to questions by Commissioner Peraica, Judge Biebel responded that court delays result from a
number of things. He said each case has its own individual facts, which is one area Professor Trotter will
address. The judge further noted that this is a complicated issue that he and Chief Judge Evans are
addressing. He said that T.A.S .C. has completed a study on the issue. Judge Biebel noted that a second
study was completed in 1967 by the Grand Jury.
In response to a question by Commissioner Collins, Judge Biebel stated that a high percentage of guilty
pleas are from persons who have Public Defenders because a high percentage of the defendants are
represented by Public Defenders. He also noted that he served as a Public Defender for Cook County for
eighteen months and the level of representation of Public Defenders is very high. The judge stated that he
would try to get the percentage of guilty pleas of people who use a Public Defender as requested by
Commissioner Collins.
In response to Commissioner Suffredin 's question, Judge Biebel stated there is no written order extending
the March Grand Jury to review the jail but he plans to write the order. The judge also stated that once a
report is made, it would be distributed to the commissioners.
Chairman Maldonado observed that 1967 was the first time the Grand Jury reviewed conditions at the
Cook County Jail and 2003 would be the second time. The chairman asked if there are plans to conduct
the reviews once every three years?
Judge Biebel stated that this is just a start and this is something he would review.

1441

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 6, 2003
Chainnan Maldonado asked James O'Rourke, Executive Director of the Judicial Advisory Council to
make a presentation.
James O' Rourke stated that the Coordinating Council was established in 1989 and is a result of a
recommendation from Professor Joseph Trotter of American University. The Council's purpose is to get
the elected officials and the senior appointed officials in the county's justice system to meet on a regular
basis to effect change in the system. The Council includes the President of the Cook County Board, the
Chainnan of the Judicial Advisory Council, Chief Judge of the Circuit Court, Presiding Judge of the
Criminal Division, State's Attorney, Sheriff, Public Defender, the Coordinator of the Bureau of Public
Safety and the Superintendent of Chicago Police. The membership has been expanded to include the
Illinois Director of the Department of Human Services, the Director of the Illinois Department of
Corrections and the Deputy Governor for Criminal Justice. Mr. O' Rourke stated that his role is to act as
the Secretary of the Council and to facilitate discussions of common concerns and implement changes
among the members.
Commissioner Moreno noted during public hearings held last year, it was suggested that the county
acquire the building across from 26th Street and California to house three to four hundred inmates for
treatment of alcohol, substance abuse or mental health problems. The commissioner commented on the
Thresholds program, which has proven to have a very high rate of reducing the recidivism ratio for people
with mental health problems.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's questions regarding whether an additional judge or courtroom
would help expedite what the county is doing in regards to parole holds, James O' Rourke responded in
the affirmative. The commissioner noted his previous request of the Judicial Advisory Council regarding
responsibility of the State of Illinois for parole holds that are currently being funded by the county. He
requested that the matter be addressed in a Board resolution prepared by the Judicial Advisory Council.
Chairman Maldonado asked if the Illinois Department of Human Services funds the treatment program
for the mentally ill.
Mr. O' Rourke responded that the county funds its own drug beds, including contracts with Gateway,
T.A.S.C. and other providers. The Department of Community Supervision and Intervention (DCSI) has a
drug treatment facility and the county also funds those beds. However, on a State wide basis the Illinois
Department of Human Services is the department that has responsibility for providing drug treatment
beds. He further observed that the Coordinating Council is working with the Illinois Department of
Human Services to see if the county's share could be increased to fund more drug treatment beds.
In response to Chairman Maldonado's inquiry, Mr. O'Rourke commented on Professor Trotter' s findings
on the jail and noted that the report identified each component of the county's judicial system and how it
could work more efficiently. He further noted that one of the recommendations was the establishment of
the Cook County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, the establishment of DCSI so that the county
has a formal mechanism to release non-violent offenders under the supervision of the Sheriff, but outside
the confines of the Department of Corrections. He concluded by saying that these are only two of the
recommendations, and there are many other recommendations that have been implemented. He stated
that he would distribute a complete list of recommendations to the commissioners.

1442

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 6, 2003

In regards to the current status of the second report, Mr. O' Rourke noted that it is in the preliminary stage.
Professor Trotter has already spoken to the elected and appointed officials of the judicial system and is
scheduled to report back to the Coordinating Council soon, where he will present his findings and
recommendations. The Coordinating Council will then ask the County Board to enter into a contract with
Professor Trotter for a complete review of the judicial system, similar to what was done ten years ago.
Chairman Maldonado asked Mr. O ' Rourke to include the Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee
in providing the fiscal impact of any state proposed legislation as he does with the Judicial Advisory
Council.
Commissioner Suffredin asked Mr. O ' Rourke if he has looked at the Governor's proposed budget and the
impact it will have on Cook County' s budget.
Mr. O' Rourke stated that he had not looked at the Governor' s budget beyond the newspaper accounts, but
he would look at it. He stated that the Coordinating Council is concerned with a number of issues at the
Detention Center, the Public Defender's Office and other programs that Cook County relies on.
