Re: Menorah Sculpture

Dear Ben:

At your request we have reviewed the attached drawing of the Menorah Sculpture and
observed the sculpture in the fabrication shop. The main vertical section of the sculpture is
an HSS 6:613116 tube column. This section sits into a 21? deep shoe with diagonal braces
on top ofa 48?" 143": thick base plate which in turn sits on top of a 38 '1 tall 
0? tubular frame angled base. The tube frame base is composed of HSS 2x2x3/16 sections.
The vertical diagonal corner members are double HSS 21:2 sections. The top of the base
has HSS 21213116 horizontal members approximately 16" me with additional tube
sections members perpendicular to the HSS 2x2 members. The base plate is mounted to the
base section with (6) 7/16 hardened steel bolts through the tube members. The bottom
of the base has diagonal members each corner for the placement of ballast.

Per the drawing provided. the total weight of the Menorah Sculpture is approximately
1600#. We have reviewed the overall stability of the sculpture for code required wind loads
including the approximate weight of the sculpture. We recommend 240%! of ballast (cement
or sand bags) be placed each corner of the base to provide additional stability against
overturning. In our opinion, with the added ballast, the sculpture 1will be stable against

overturning.

Please feel free to call if you have any questions or need any additional information.

TO: Detroit City Council

FROM: David D. Whitaker, Directo
Legislative Policy Division Staff

DATE: November 7, 2018
RE: Analysis on Spacing Requirements for Auto-Related Businesses

This report is in response to Councilmember Castaneda-Lopez?s October 22, 2018 memorandum
requesting the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) to provide an analysis on existing City Code
regulations pertaining to spacing requirements between multiple automotive related businesses,
including used motor vehicle storage or sales lots, motor vehicle services, major and minor; and
motor vehicle washing auto shops.

Storage Lot

As it relates to used motor vehicle storage or sales lots, they are two identi?ed uses
within the Detroit Zoning Ordinance. A ?motor vehicle storage lot? is de?ned as:

?Storage of new or used motor vehicles, accessory to a salesroom or sales lot for
operable new or used motor vehicles, but excluding towing service storage yards. For
zoning purposes, such storage lots are not considered parking lots. 

Sec. 61-12-211. Motor vehicles, new or used: storage lot accessory to a salesroom or sales lot for
new or used motor vehicles requires the following regulations:

?Storage lots accessory to a salesroom or sales lot for new or used motor vehicles shall
be subject to the following provisions:
(1) Such storage lots for motor vehicle salesrooms or sales lots exclude use as
?towing service storage yards, as defined in Sec. 61-16?182 of this Code; and

(2) Any portion of such storage lots designed or used for the storage of
commercial vehicles or semi-trucks shall be located a minimum of twenty-five
(25) feet from properties adjacent or across an alley and used for residential
purposes. 

There are currently no spacing requirements for motor vehicle storage lots as a stand-alone land
use, as they are typically accessory to new or used motor vehicle salesrooms or sales lots.

Salesroom or Sales Lot

?Motor Vehicles, new or used, salesroom or sales lot? are not explicitly de?ned in the Detroit
Zoning Ordinance, however, in 2012 the Detroit City Council adopted a number of revisions to
Sec. 61-12-213. Motor vehicles, used, salesroom or sales lot, which among other regulations
implemented a 1,000 radial foot spacing requirement between any new or newly established used
motor vehicle salesroom or sales lot, from any existing used motor vehicle salesroom or sales lot,
located within or outside of the City of Detroit?s boundaries.

While the regulations do not place a cap on the number of salesrooms or sales lot within the City
of Detroit, the spacing requirements seek to limit the over concentration of automotive related
uses. This section also restrict used automotive sales to major or secondary thoroughfares within
the City of Detroit which limits the impacts such uses might have on residential neighborhoods.

Motor vehicle washing and steam cleaning

Motor vehicle washing and steam cleaning operations are regulated by Sec. 61-12?216 of the
Detroit Zoning Ordinance. There are fourteen regulations associated with such uses ranging
from the proximity to residentially zoned land, to design and dimensional standards, however,
limitations on the number of such uses is not among them.

LPD staff is available to work with the of?ce of Council Member Castaneda-Lopez to review
and possibly amend the existing regulations associated with the aforementioned land uses.
However, any recommended changes to the text of Chapter 61 Zoning, will be subject to the
public hearing requirement of the City of Detroit Zoning Ordinance and the Michigan Zoning
Enabling Act. The complete sections which regulate the above listed uses in the Detroit Zoning
Ordinance are attached for your review.
