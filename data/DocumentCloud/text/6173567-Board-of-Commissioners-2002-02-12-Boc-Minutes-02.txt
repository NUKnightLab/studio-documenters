Commissioner Young, Chairperson of the Tenant Services Committee, presented the following
report. Per Commissioner Young, The Tenant Services and Operations and Facilities Committees
held a joint meeting on Wednesday, February 13, 2002 at the 626 Corporate Office. Adrianne
Minley, Managing Director of Internal Support presented a report on the New Procurement
Process.
Commissioner Young then presented an Omnibus Motion for the approval of Items A1 through A6
recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services and Operations & Facilities Committees.
(Item A1)
3

 The resolution for Item A1 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement between the CHA and the
participating housing authorities and the Metropolitan Planning Council (MPC) to establish the
Regional Housing Initiative (RHI) in order to stimulate the supply of rental housing for lowincome families by pooling together Housing Choice Vouchers to establish project-based
developments. A key finding of a recently released MPC report on housing options was the
shortage of rental housing affordable to families earning less than $20,000 per year. The study
also found that the rents near burgeoning employment centers are higher than what entry-level
workers can afford. Therefore, in order to create additional rental units in opportunity areas for
CHA relocatees and Section 8 applicants, the CHA will pool some of its vouchers with other
participating housing authorities to create project-based developments ideal sites. RHI will allow
relocatees and Section 8 applicants a greater opportunity to be housed quicker and be closer to
economic opportunities. For the first year of the RHI, the CHA will contribute approximately 219
of 335 available vouchers under this program. The CHA may choose to contribute more or less
vouchers in future years to the RHI.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-15
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter dated February 19, 2002
entitled “Intergovernmental Agreement between the Chicago Housing Authority

establish the Regional Housing Initiative”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee

approved hereby, between the CHA, the Housing Authority of Cook County, the
Lake County Housing Authority, the McHenry County Housing Authority, the
Metropolitan Planning Council, and the Illinois Housing Development Authority to
establish a new program entitled the Regional Housing Initiative ("RHI") and to
approve final revisions to such agreement, the execution thereof to constitute
conclusive approval of any such revisions.
