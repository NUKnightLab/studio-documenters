Board and Committee Reports (continued)
E. Managed Care Committee Meeting, September 17, 2015
i. Metrics (Attachment #4)
ii. Meeting Minutes
Director Lerner presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the Metrics with Mr. Elwell. The Board reviewed and
discussed the information.
The Board discussed the subject of inpatient admissions through the Emergency Department (ED) versus direct
admissions from the clinics. Dr. Shannon indicated that, in both the Stroger and Provident Hospital environment, the
percentage that is admitted through the ED is greater than 90%. Mr. Elwell indicated that the administration will be
working to change that.
Director Butler inquired whether the administration has considered promoting redetermination through the mail order
pharmacy prescriptions that are filled. Mr. Elwell indicated that the plan to do that has been discussed, but has not
yet been implemented.
Chairman Hammock stated that, in recent weeks, it has been announced that CCHHS is issuing a new Request for
Proposals (RFP) for third party administrator (TPA) services. At a recent committee meeting, a group of public
speakers spoke against that idea; they said that the change in TPA will disrupt service. He wants to be very clear
about why CCHHS is changing TPAs and why it is not permitting the existing provider to bid. In the Managed Care
Committee data is a review of all of the large health plans. CountyCare is the third largest in the Chicago region, with
165,000 enrollees; the fourth largest is the IlliniCare Health Plan, who is also CCHHS’ TPA provider and competitor,
with 143,000 enrollees. IlliniCare is almost the same size as CountyCare, in terms of members, even though they
started later than CountyCare. When CCHHS first hired them as their TPA, they were not important in this area;
however, they have recently made a corporate decision that this is going to be an important part of their business
going forward – that is the reason for the decision to restrict their ability to bid in this TPA, because of their
competitive nature.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of the Minutes of the Managed
Care Committee Meeting of September 17, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Action Items
A. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #6)
This item was taken out of order and was considered during the review of the Metrics and Financial Statements
relating to the Finance Committee.
Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the requests presented for the Board’s consideration. The Board reviewed and
discussed the requests.
Mr. Elwell and Caryn Stancik, Executive Director of Communications, provided additional information regarding
request number 7. Mr. Elwell stated that, previously, CCHHS had a marketing contract with Res Publica that was
the product of a bid process; they primarily did work for the CountyCare Health Plan. Recently, an RFP was issued
for marketing; the contract will be evenly split between the Health Plan and CCHHS as a provider. This will be a
targeted marketing campaign; efforts will be tracked to measure effectiveness. Additionally, there will be a targeted
approach with regard to capacity. Some measures that will be tracked include the number of calls that are generated,
efforts regarding redetermination, and brand recognition.
Director Estrada inquired regarding the work that Res Publica will outsource to minority vendors; he expressed
concern that when one views their team online, there does not appear to be a person of color who is part of their
team. Ms. Stancik stated that, historically, their media buying has all been outsourced to a minority- and womenowned business enterprise (M/WBE) vendor. The printing was extensively outsourced to a minority-owned business
enterprise (MBE); that, for the most part, represents the 48% goal reached in M/WBE participation in their previous
contract. She expects that to continue. They have not yet decided how much advertising to do in this next round, so
the numbers will fluctuate a little bit, based on the advertising buys. Director Estrada inquired as to the vendor’s
ability to create an effective strategy for this population. Ms. Stancik stated that, the two (2) companies who provide
the M/WBE media communications teams also provide consultation to that exact point; research will also inform all
of those strategies. She indicated that she will have a conversation with them to make sure they are using all of these
resources to contribute to the messaging.
In response to a question from Director Wiese regarding marketing efforts in the last marketing campaign that didn’t
seem to reach areas on the North Side of Chicago, Ms. Stancik stated that the first campaign targeted 25 zip codes
where the most Medicaid applicants lived. In this next round they will do some reputation building for the System
across the County, and will do some additional CountyCare marketing in additional areas.
In response to a question from Director Collens regarding whether this level of funding will be adequate for these
purposes, Ms. Stancik stated that one of the reasons to hire an ad buyer is to help evaluate that; they will work through
those numbers and understand the cost per recognition. She noted that they do not have baseline research data on
the System, so that is one of the things that will happen in the early stages of this contract; following that, they will
be able to determine what is needed to move the needle on the reputation of CCHHS.
Director Velasquez noted that, to be successful in these efforts, something that has to go hand-in-hand with marketing
efforts are grassroots efforts of community health workers. On the subject of grassroots efforts, Director Junge
encouraged the administration to reach out to the union leadership, as unions have huge capacities and tens of
thousands of members throughout the Cook County area; these are members who belong to churches, are active in
their communities, and are a rich resource for grassroots efforts.
With regard to request number 13, Mr. Elwell provided information regarding this sole source contract. He stated
that the manufacturer of the equipment used for immunology work has only one (1) set of reagents that are
manufactured by that company; as long as that equipment is being used, CCHHS is tied to buying those reagents
from that company.
Director Collens, seconded by Director Lerner,
Page 4 moved
of 91 the approval of request numbers 1 through
12, under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 V.

Action Items (continued)
B. Appointment of Stroger Hospital Department Chair(s) and Division Chair(s) (Attachment #7)
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Marsh, moved the approval of the proposed
appointments of Stroger Hospital Department Chair and Division Chairs. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Request for Board approval of CCHHS administration’s submittal of documentation for Provident Hospital
to the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board (IHFSRB) for the following (deferred at the
August 28, 2015 Board of Directors Meeting):
• Notice of intent – to continue Intensive Care Unit (ICU) service, with reduction from eleven (11) to six (6)
beds
• Certificate of Exemption – to not re-open the Obstetrics Unit; change status of services from suspended
to discontinued
Mr. Elwell and Dr. Karen Duncan, Interim Chief Operating Officer of Hospital-Based Services, provided an
overview of the request.
Mr. Elwell noted that, with regard to the Obstetrics Unit at Provident Hospital, there is an issue of tremendous
standby costs, no matter how many deliveries are being done. The unit was suspended five (5) years ago; the
administration would like to move forward with a permanent closing. After reviewing the variable costs of just the
physician and nurse coverage that would be needed to staff the unit, they could not even reach a break-even position.
Additionally, from a patient safety perspective, typically when volume goes down in that area, the chances of it not
being as safe go up.
Mr. Elwell stated that, with regard to the ICU service at Provident Hospital, the administration looked at that slightly
differently, as that is a service that allows for the provision of other services. Provident is currently licensed for
eleven (11) beds; the administration intends to reinstate six (6) of the eleven (11) beds - they want to continue to
expand, particularly outpatient surgery services, and continue other services, so this seemed to be a prudent way to
do it. He noted that, at six (6) beds, there are rules that say if an organization stays above 50% of its licensure, then
if it chooses, it can go back to its full licensure without requesting IHFSRB approval.
Director Marsh inquired regarding whether there are unmet needs in the area for obstetrics care. Dr. Shannon
clarified that these actions are entirely around hospital-based services. At the Provident site, they will continue to
provide prenatal care and ambulatory gynecologic care; he noted that gynecologic surgery is a significant part of
the volume at the Provident site. Overall, women’s health services will be continuing; this action relates only to a
reduction in acute licensed obstetrics beds.
With regard to the rule referenced during the discussion of the ICU service that allows an organization to go back
to full licensure without requesting IHFSRB approval if it stays above 50% of its licensure, Director Butler inquired
whether CCHHS needs to get the IHFSRB to commit to that rule in writing. Mr. Elwell responded that he will ask
the attorneys to cite that rule/law in the communication that will be sent to the IHFSRB.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to approve the issuance of the
communication to the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board that will include the
Notice of Intent to continue Intensive Care Unit (ICU) service at Provident Hospital of Cook
County, with a reduction from eleven (11) to six (6) beds, and request for a Certificate of
Exemption to not re-open the Obstetrics Unit at Provident Hospital of Cook County, to change
the status of services from suspended to discontinued.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from Chairman of the Board
A.

Quarterly report on Board and Committee meeting attendance by Directors and members of
Committees (Attachment #8)

Chairman Hammock stated that the quarterly report on Board and Committee meeting attendance is included in the
materials. He thanked the Directors for excellent attendance at the meetings.
Chairman Hammock encouraged the Committee Chairs to take a look at their metrics again, to determine whether any
changes will need to be made in the new fiscal year; he noted that he is particularly interested in seeing metrics in FY2016
relating to ambulatory services. He stated that changes to metrics should be made in December, so they can be presented
in time for the January Board Meeting.
VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #9.
Following are verbatim comments included as part of the record at the request of Dr. Shannon; these comments were
provided during the presentation of the Report of the Chief Executive Officer.
I’ll point out that there has been a significant amount of public comments made about various actions
as they relate to Pediatrics. Since those have been made very publicly, I just want to put in a few
clarifying remarks for the record.
The first point I would make, as we have talked about before, there has been no reduction in Pediatric
services at Stroger Hospital. Rather, these are operational changes that reflect the volumes that we
are seeing. We will do everything necessary to make sure that as we’re doing those changes there is
no change in the safety, quality or experience for the individuals served, except in a positive direction.
The second point that I would make - we look at these changes as an opportunity to improve our
ultimate strategy to expand pediatric, ambulatory and primary care services. We will only be able
to grow that service when we get out of the Fantus Building. Some of that will require changes. You
approved today architecture services that are helping us find ways to bring the Pediatric services,
which are going to be the first things to move out of the Fantus Building, into the four walls of a much
more clean, light-filled, safe environment, which is the Stroger Specialty Care Center, and those
changes will be helpful.
Lastly, I want to be very clear that there has been no restriction, and I think the facts speak for
themselves in that regard. There has been no restriction on public speaking by any member of the
staff, and if you don’t believe me, watch the tapes of the Cook County Board Meetings. So we don’t
believe that. We have been communicative about these things, both with leadership and with frontline staff. We will continue to develop our strategy going forward. We have done, I think, a good
job with communicating that strategy. I’m grateful to our communications team for the Briefs you’re
all familiar with, and we’ll go forward in that regard.

 VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (continued)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on the Central Campus Redevelopment. He stated that staff continue to work with the
finalist for these services. As a reminder, there was a process related to an RFP for design development for the Central
Campus building that will allow for the mothballing of the Fantus Building, Administration Building and the Hektoen
Building. This will be a 100,000-120,000 square foot facility on this campus to be used for both ambulatory services and
administrative office space. Right now, the administration is working under a letter of agreement; this is the first step
with the design finalist. When agreement is reached on that, a more detailed contract will be presented to the Board for
approval; this will likely happen in October. This project requires the cooperation and intersection of CCHHS, who issued
this RFP and who will be operating this building, and County administration. Following the approval of the contract by
this Board, he expects that it will be presented for approval by the Cook County Board of Commissioner in November.

JOHN JAY SHANNON, MD

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

COOK COUNTY HEALTH 8: HOSPITALS SYSTEM
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
SEPTEMBER 25, 2015

 

Recognition

Patricia Raksin, MD is a physician in the Division of Neurosurgery and holds positions as Director of Neurosurgery ICU
and Chief, Section of Neurotrauma and Neurocritical Care. She is a graduate of Yale University (BS) and University of
Maryland School of Medicine (MD). Dr. Raksin?s career and committee service (Hospital Oversight, Critical Care
Committee, Stroke Task Force, Executive Medical Staff vice-president, 2013-2015) are considerable.

Dr. Raksin served as a co-author of Atlas of Emergency Neurosurgery which was published in July of this year. The Atlas is
a 528-page step-by-step-visual guide to performing surgical procedures used in neurotrauma as well as non-traumatic
cases, with more than 500 illustrations that help clarify each presented procedure.

Chandra Chataut, MD, an attending physician/hospitalist in the Division of Hospital Medicine, participated in relief
efforts following the devastating earthquakes that struck Nepal this spring. During the earthquakes, more than 8,000
people were killed, nearly 17,000 people were injured, and the homes of over 473,000 Nepali people were destroyed.
Things are slowly returning to normal in the main city of Kathmandu, where roads and trails are largely cleared, and
electricity, phone lines and the internet are working; not yet the case in the small towns and villages.

In June, Dr. Chataut traveled back to Nepal, where he was born and raised, to see his family and to assist and treat
earthquake victims. He participated in three medical camps in villages most affected by the earthquakes, including
Barpak, where he treated over 200 patients. Twenty-six hospitals in Nepal were damaged, so emergency medical care
and as well as basic public health essentials including food and clean water were much needed. To prevent water-borne
illnesses, water purification tablets were widely distributed by the medical teams.

Robert A. Weinstein, MD, former chair, Department of Medicine and currently serving as a voluntary
physician and Principle Investigator for the Chicago CDC Prevention Epicenter has been appointed to the Presidential
Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic~Resistant Bacteria (the Advisory Council). Established by Executive Order
13676, signed by President Obama on Sept. 18, 2014, the Advisory Council, comprising fifteen experts and five
organizations, will provide advice, information, and recommendations to the HHS Secretary on programs and policies
related to combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Dr. Weinstein has been involved in the treatment and research of
antimicrobial agents for over 30 years working in academic settings such as the University of Chicago, as an infectious
disease physician at Michael Reese Hospital and Cook County Hospital and as the Chairman of committees for anti-
infectives, drug and antibiotic formularies, and infection prevention. He has developed new methods to improve patient
care and safety with a focus on infection prevention and proper antimicrobial use. He has published extensively on
adverse outcomes stemming from the inappropriate use of antibiotics and on methods to improve the use of
antimicrobials in patients in various healthca re settings.

Kyle Popovich, MD, and Robert Weinstein, MD are authors of ?Evolving Epidemiology of Staphylococcus oureus
Bacteremia? published this month in Infection Control Hospital Epidemiolooy, the journal of the Society for Healthcare
Epidemiology of America. The study concluded that the incidence of the most common strain of Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections has decreased in hospital-onset cases, but has failed to decline in the broader
community. The dominant strain of the drug-resistant bacteria, MRSAUSA300, has emerged as a particularly antibiotic
resistant form that is prevalent in communities and healthcare institutions. The study was conducted by CCH HS and
Rush physicians.

The Associate Board ofthe Cook County Health Foundation was established within the last year by a group of ambitious
young professionals. Under the mentorship of CCHF Board member Monica Heth, the Associate Board held their first
event last week. More than 100 young professionals attended the event and raised $5000 for pediatric oncology
services. The executive board of the Associate Board includes Josh Sorin, Lindsay Zimmerman, Mindi Knebel and Dana
Sodikoff.

Patient Experience Recognition
Excerpt from an email received from Dr. Hsing Pao, Family Medicine

There is an especially amazing, I think CNA named onia Sims-Jackson (T J) has gone above and beyond my
expectations here at County. I had the pleasure of interacting with her during my time on the service towards
the end of this most recent July. We had a patient who was very difficult to deal with because of his condition.
We had a constant one-on-one (supervision) for him for the majority of his stay with us. One morning, I found
out that TJ, his one-on?one that night, had bathed him, cut his hair and even given him a shave. I have never
seen anyone in County take the time to care for a patient like that as he was extremely disheveled before his
grooming. TJ exempli?ed what we should all strive for in County - to not only care for our patients with pride
but also compassion. I was taught in my previous training that we should treat our patients as our family, and I
can say that did just that. I have never seen anyone in this hospital care for a patient as she did. And I would
like to make it known that she did such an amazing job solely upon her own volition. I hope that acts like these
do not go unnoticed here in County, and exempli?z something that we all strive for.

is piloting a three question food insecurity screening tool at the Logan Square Health Center.
During pediatric intake, parents will be asked about their access to food over the past 12 months,
including whether they skipped meals because they did not have enough food. Patients answering
affirmatively to any of the questions will have Food Resources for Patients, added to their
record. The resource includes a hotline to provide Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food
stamps), information about the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program and a directory of food
pantries in proximity to Logan Square (and all other ACHN sites). In addition to this resource, patients
identified as 'food insecure? will be provided with a voucher to visit the Greater Chicago Food

featured on Fox's Tipping Point Segment (tentatively) on October 6th.

CCH HS has contracted with Press Ganey to administer a Culture of Safety survey providing every
employee an opportunity to participate and provide individual feedback on the safety of the
organization. This independent measure of staff perceptions is intended to identify areas for patient
safety improvement and evaluate the impact of safety initiatives. The anonymous online survey will go
live in the next few weeks. Results will be available one month following the conclusion of the survey.

Legislative Update

Local

On September 9, 2015, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle appointed Mary Richardson-Lowry to
serve on the Board of Directors filling the unexpired term created by the resignation of Reverend Calvin
Morris. The appointment was referred to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee for
consideration. A confirmation hearing is scheduled for early October. If confirmed by the Legislation and
Intergovernmental Affairs Committee and ratified by the full Cook County Board on October 7, 2015 the
appointment will be effective immediately.

Ms. Richardson-Lowry, an attorney, most recently was a partner with the law firm of Mayer Brown. She held a
number of positions at the city of Chicago under the Richard M. Daley administration including serving as
Building Commissioner from 1998?2002. Ms. Richardson-Lowry is a civic leader serving on numerous boards
and commissions and is a current Executive Committee Member ofthe Chicago Community Trust Foundation.

On September 9, 2015 the Cook County Board approved Preliminary FY2016 Budget for inclusion in the
President's FY2015 Executive Budget Recommendation. The President is expected to introduce her proposed
budget to the Cook County Board in October. The Cook County Finance Committee will then conduct public
hearings as well as departmental/agency review hearings. The budget is expected to be approved prior to
November 30, 2015 which is the end ofthe fiscal year.

3 Page

Page 87 of 91

 

On September 9th the Cook County Board also approved a Resolution setting parameters for Cost of Living
Adjustments for non-union employees. Human Resources is working in conjunction with Finance
to identify the specific positions the resolution will apply to and the associated financial impact to the System.
We anticipate sharing that detail with the HR and Finance Committees, as well as the full Board, in October.

State

0 is now in the 13th week of the 2016 fiscal year without a comprehensive budget in place. The new state
fiscal year started July 1, 2015. It is estimated that nearly 90% ofthe state budget has been committed for
spending in the 2016 fiscal year through previous General Assembly action (continuing appropriations) or
through various court rulings and administration actions. The remaining 10% includes funding for higher
education, such as student financial assistance programs, as well as local health protection grants, of which
receives approximately $2.2 million, and funding for services to vulnerabie populations such as the
homeless, survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, and persons at risk of HIV. It is likely that many of
our patients have been adversely impacted by the lack of funding for these human services programs.

0 Earlier this summer, the Shriver Center and the Legal Council for Health Justice filed court motions under
existing Medicaid consent decrees to compel Illinois to pay Medicaid providers. Federal Judge Joan Lefkow
agreed with the motions and ordered the State to pay ALL Medicaid providers statewide, even in absence of a
state budget. On September 16th state officials were in federal court at which time the Illinois Comptroller
reported $42 million in expedited Medicaid payments were recently approved. However, most Medicaid
providers, including managed care plans, have not received any payment for services provided in the current
state fiscal year, which began July 1.

The Illinois Senate voted 44-11?0 to override Governor Rauner?s amendatory veto on H31, the Heroin Crisis Act.
The House previously overrode the veto. As a result, the bill is now clear to become law. Medicaid is impacted in
the following ways:

0 Requires all medication assisted treatment (injectable naltrexone, methadone, suboxone, etc.)
prescribed for the treatment of alcohol or opioid dependence to be covered under fee for service and
managed care medical assistance programs. It shall not be subject to any utilization control (other than
those established by the American Society of Addiction Medicine), prior authorization or lifetime
restriction limit mandate.

Requires opioid antagonists prescribed by a physician for the treatment of an opioid overdose, including
the medication, administration device, and any pharmacy administration fees, to be covered under the
medical assistance program.

0 The Illinois Senate passed $32046, which was amended to appropriate $48 in human services and public health
programs, including local health protection grants, HIV prevention and treatment, early childhood, domestic
violence and sexual assault services, and homeless service programs. The bill passed 36-19-0 on partisan lines.
The bill uses general revenue and special state funds to pay for these services. 532046 was approved by
committee on September 24th and will require a 3/5 majority (71 votes) of the House to pass.

0 The Senate is scheduled to return to Springfield on October the House is scheduled to return on October
10?.

Federal
- On August 10, 2015 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) convened a conference call with
Los Angeles County (CA), Hennepin County (MN), Salt Lake County (UT) and the National Association of
County Organizations to discuss inmate sub?regulatory guidance which is expected to be issued by CMS
in the coming months. Inmate exclusion does not permit Medicaid payments to providers for inmates

while incarcerated. made the point to CMS that the Cook County Jail, unlike prisons, houses pre-trial
detainees who have not been convicted. continues to work with and will be convening additional
meetings on this issue with Administration officials.

On September 8, 2015 the House and Senate returned from summer recess. The Federal Fiscal year ends
September 30th and it is still unclear whether Congress can agree on legislation to keep the government Open. If
a shutdown occurs it is likely to be short in duration with a Continuing Resolution (CR) put in place to allow
essential areas of the government to continue functioning. Medicaid payments would continue to flow as
entitlement programs would be covered by the CR.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.

STRATEGIC
PLANNING

Over the course of the next few months, there are a
number of operational changes that wili move
forward as we continue the transformation of
into a modern, patient?centered
organization.

These decisions have been made after thorough
analysis of trends in patient volumes and patient
needs, all within the context of the competitive
environment is operating in. We hape that all
employees will embrace these changes and
take the time to understand the rationale behind
each of them.

Improvements to CountyCare - CountyCare is
currently the largest plan serving Medicaid
beneficiaries who reside in Cook County. As a result
of its success, size and complexity, leadership has
decided to rebid the third party administrator
contract as well as several benefits management
functions such as dental, optical and
pharmaceutical services. We believe this will save
money and allow us to incorporate new
member benefits which should increase satisfaction
with the plan. The new services will not go into effect
until April of 20l 6 and should be relatively invisible to
members. Members will receive a new CountyCare
card but their benefits will not change.

ASC When the Ambulatory Screening Clinic at
Fantus was first opened, it sat in the middle of a busy
neighborhood with limited outpatient services,
particularly on weekends. Significant neighborhood
changes coupled with the number of newly insured
individuals able to access care closer to their home
have caused a rapid decline in weekend utilization.
Patients now have access to care closer to their
home through their primary care medical home,
whether a primary care home or a Federally
Qualified Health Center. This is good news and a far
better way to provide care. As a result, ASC will no
longer offer weekend hours. Patients are being
directed to contact their primary care provider for
non-emergent care and patients with possibly life-
threatening illness should always be directed to the
nearest emergency room.

Emergency Department Services at Stroger - The
typical model in a general hospital is to have a
single emergency department. Currently, Stroger
Hospital has two separate emergency departments:
the main emergency department and one that
serves patients from birth to age 2i. With
approximately 5% of all Stroger emergency room
patients under the age of 18, the volume of
pediatric cases is simply too low to justify a stand?
alone unit. Working with Emergency Department,
Nursing and Pediatric leadership, we will designate
exam rooms in the main emergency room to
accommodate pediatric patients in the coming
months. No service reductions will occur as a result
of this operational change.

Inpatient Pediatrics Over recent decades,
pediatric admissions to acute care hospitals
nationally have declined due to the success of
advancements like immunizations and antibiotics.
Additionally, in Illinois, the All Kids program
introduced in 2005 provided coverage to virtually
every child in In 2013, approximately 55
percent of children had coverage through
private/commercial insurance plans and 40 percent
were covered by state health programs. These
events should be viewed as public health victories.
Fewer kids need hospitalization, including those we
have traditionally served. will continue to
provide inpatient pediatric services co?locafed with
our pediatric intensive care unit. All inpatient
services will be staffed to patient volumes.
Additionally, patients 18 and over which represent
25% of our current pediatric inpatient volumes will be
cared for on adult floors, irrespective of the treating
service.

Should you have any questions, please contact your
executive leader.

Sincerely,


=5 .
