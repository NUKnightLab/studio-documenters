SCOPE: REHABILITATE BUILDING
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 2630 W Lafayette Boulevard is a 3½-story structure that was constructed in 1924 as the Ste
Anne Convent. Clad in red brick, the building features brick, stone, and wood detailing and arched masonry openings
at the front façade. A painted wood ramp exists at the east half of the front entrance. The simple massing is topped
with a multi-gable roof features two prominent dormers flanking a smaller third dormer at the front (south) façade and
a small dormer at the rear (north) façade. The roof is covered in dark gray asphalt shingles. The side yard adjacent to
the alley (east) is landscaped while the rear yard is an asphalt parking area. The west side yard includes a raised
exterior patio off the main massing of the building. A chain-link fence surrounds the side and rear yards.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
• The rear yard (parking area) is visible from the right-of-way
ISSUES
• The Fence and Hedge Guidelines state, “A single lot shall contain no more than two types of fencing

 material.” Currently, a chain-link fence exists at the perimeter of the lot and the applicant is proposing a new
wood fence in a new location which would cause there to be two different types of fencing on the lot.
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, does not destroy historic materials that characterize the historic
building, its site, and setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission find the scope items listed above to be
appropriate as the scope of work meets the following Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual
qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary,
physical, or pictorial evidence.
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in
the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
However, staff recommends that the Commission issue this COA with the following condition:
• HDC Staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve any minor revisions to the project's design
prior to the issuance of the permit. Should staff determine that such revisions are not consistent with the
intent of the Commission’s approval or do not meet the SOI Standards, staff shall forward the project to the
Commission for review at a regular meeting.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. The buildings of the Ste. Anne's Parish Complex vary in the number of stories and height. The church is a tall
single story space that is approximately forty (40) feet in height to the eaves according to the Sanborn Maps, which
list the height of the towers at the northern corners of the church as being one hundred eighty (180) feet. The rectory
is two and one-half (2½) stories tall, meaning that it has two (2) full stories and an attic space. The school is three and
one-half (3½) stories tall, meaning that it has three (3) full stories and an attic space. The convent is two and one-half
(2½) stories tall meaning that it has two (2) full stories and an attic space. The hall is one and a half (1½) stories tall,
with walls one (1) story in height and a tall roof into which the interior space projects.
(2) Proportion of buildings' front facades. The facade of the church is taller than wide due to the towers, but gives an
impression of balance with its tall towers widely spaced on either side of the central facade. The side elevations of the
church are wider than tall to their eaves, and there is no visible rear elevation because of the abutting chapel. The
rectory appears originally to have been proportioned vertically, but the later addition of the extensive porch on the
west and south sides balance the facades by introducing a strong horizontal element. The convent facade is balanced.
The school facade is balanced, but the central gable and the cupola tend to create a feeling of verticality. The hall is
rather horizontal in feeling because of the wider base and the narrower two (2) story central bay.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facades. Openings in the facade of the church amount to approximately five (5)
percent. All openings are taller than wide except for the circular window centered in the central bay. Openings on
other facades of the church are similarly proportioned. Openings in other buildings occupy a higher percentage of wall
area, varying from building to building. In general, openings are taller than wide. In some instances individual
openings which are taller than wide are combined in a single opening and divided by mullion(s); in such cases the
total opening may be balanced or wider than tall. The horizontal windows over the infill in the openings on the south
side of the rectory porch are later and uncharacteristic.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The front facade of the church is divided into three (3) sections: The
center main gabled section and the two (2) projecting tower sections at the outer ends. The gaps between the central
gable wall and the towers are an important design element of this building. The large stained glass circular window in
the facade is positioned above the central entrance opening. There are ogival windows arranged symmetrically in the
facade, and blind arcading is a feature that occurs in several locations. The octagonal upper stages of the towers have
one (1) tall ogival opening filled with lowers on each face. The side elevation of the church on Ste. Anne Street has its
openings regularly arranged. Although not fully symmetrical, the openings in the front facade of the rectory are also

 regularly arranged. The Mansard roof has dormers arranged above the windows in the wall below. The openings in
the front facades of the school, convent, and hall are fully symmetrical and regularly arranged.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. Not applicable due to single complex district.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Because of the relationship of the separate buildings that make up the
complex, no rhythm is established.
(7) Relationship of materials. Detroit common brick is the dominant material of the complex. Stone is commonly used
for decorative purposes, for sills, and for other functional elements. The whole lower level of the church facade is
stone. The church and hall retain slate roofs, while the other buildings have been re-roofed in asphalt shingle. Wood
trim is commonplace. The church facade and towers have sheet metal elements originally meant to imitate stone.
(8) Relationship of textures. The major textural relationship is that of common brick laid in mortar. The slate roofs
contribute significantly to textural interest, while the asphalt roofs do not. Wood, which is generally smooth, is
commonly used for the trim and functional elements such as windows and doors. Secondary textural relationships
exist, such as the juxtaposition of stone trim with common brick, the rock-faced texture of the stone base of the
church facade, and the use of sheet metal elements. The glazing on all buildings, especially the church, provides a
contrasting smooth surface.
(9) Relationship of color. The orange-red of Detroit common brick is the predominant color, and in some cases is
darkened with age and dirt. The roofs of the church and hall are composed of natural color slate, with gray being the
most predominant color. Stone colors contrast with the common brick. The copper trim has weathered to a shade of
green. Wood trim is usually painted brown, although other colors might be appropriate. In some places, the sheet
metal is painted stone color, in imitation of stone, and is appropriate. The natural wood doors of the church contrast
with the stone color of the base of the facade.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. The architectural elements and details of Ste. Anne's Church reflect its Gothic
Revival Style. Buttresses exist to the sides of the entrances, at the corners of the front facade, at the transition between
the main bay of the front facade and the bays dividing it from the towers, on the side elevations at the corners, and
between aisle windows. The two (2) towers with their steeples have had some details removed since their
construction, but still display typical details such as pinnacles. Above the molded and carved central doorway in the
gable of the main section of the church facade is a blind arcade and a large traceried circular window. Within the apex
of the large gable is a blind triple arch. There is a small cupola in "fleche" position on the roof at the intersection of
the nave and transepts.
Details of the other buildings conform to their styles and types. The school is vaguely Gothic or Tudor Revival, with
buttresses which flank the entrance and at the corners of the facade, and with a cupola with ogival openings. The
rectory's appearance has been greatly altered by the addition of large porches with masonry piers to the west and
south. The house was originally an eclectic design with a Mansard roof. The details of the rectory itself are in accord
with the usual treatment of eclectic Victorian residences of the 1880's, while the porches have a strong prairie and/or
arts and crafts character. The convent is Romanesque Revival in style with strong architectural elements such as
arched windows, and relatively simple surfaces, which are typical of that style. The hall is designed in a classical
manner, with quoins laid in the brick, a triple-arched arcade in the second floor of the facade, and a classical
pediment. Its details are in accord with the classical manner.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. The main roof of the church is a front-facing gable with a transverse gable over the
crossing and transepts. The towers are roofed with tall steeples. The rectory has a Mansard roof interrupted by
dormers. The convent has a side facing gabled roof flanked by gabled parapet walls and fronted by a pair of wall
dormers. A small dormer lies higher in the roof between the wall dormers. The hall has a broad hip roof, the upper
central portion of which is carried forward as a front-facing gable roof. The school has intersecting hipped roofs with
a tall wall dormer centered on the front and a cupola at the intersection of the ridges.
(12) Walls of continuity. Because of the small size of the district, the walls of continuity tend to be weakened; however,
the church and school share a similar setback on the Howard Street frontage. The church, chapel, garage, and rectory
form a strong wall of continuity on St. Anne Street. The side of the rectory, the hall, and the convent form a strong
wall of continuity on Lafayette Boulevard.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The church faces a public space created by
the closure of Howard Street. The surface treatments and plantings are typical of the 1970's. The Ste. Anne frontage is
characterized by a grass turf lawn and modest plantings lying between the public sidewalk and the church, chapel, and
rectory, with a drive leading to the garage. The setback on Lafayette Boulevard is very shallow, but is consistent, and
there are areas of grass turf lawn and plantings. There is a recent timber-built wheelchair ramp in front of the convent.
An asphalt parking lot occupies the space that is between the church and school, and behind the school, convent, and
hall. There is a State of Michigan Historical Marker on the lawn at the northwest corner of the property.

 (14) Relationship of open space to structures. The public space in front of the church is intended to serve as a forecourt to
a landmark building. The open space on the Ste. Anne frontage consists of the setback to the building line and modest
plantings. There is a little open space on Lafayette Boulevard since the setback is shallow. The parking area in the
center of the property and between the church and school tends to be invisible except when viewed from the Howard
Street side and from within the space itself. There are dwellings located across from the property on Ste. Anne Street
and considerable vacant land in both residential and commercial areas around the property, that is partially due to
decline, and partially due to clearance.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. The Ste. Anne's Parish Complex rises above the residential and commercial
structures that surround it. In that context, its scale is grand, although only the church is of monumental scale. Major
elements of the church such as towers, spires, transepts, and apses, are also large in scale. Other buildings are less
monumental, but still contain the large elements typical of buildings of a public character.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. In general, the original directional expression of all the buildings, except
the hall and school, was vertical. In the church, the wide spread of the towers reduces the vertical impression, but the
facade is distinctly taller than wide. The added porches of the rectory are opposed to its original vertical expression,
and the building now tends to balance. The convent retains its vertical expression. The hall has always tended to a
horizontal expression of the front elevation. The school tends to the vertical, although the original two (2) story
building, prior to the addition of the third floor, was likely horizontal in expression.
(17) Rhythm of building set backs. Little rhythm is established in this district with few buildings.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. There is no standard range of lot coverage among separate properties because this is a
single complex, and the buildings vary greatly in size. The buildings of the complex as a whole occupy between forty
(40) percent and forty-five (45) percent of the property.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facades. The facade of the church, rectory, convent, school, and hall are all fairly
straightforward in their arrangements of elements, but display some complexity of details. Overall, there is a fair
degree of complexity.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. The church and school are oriented toward Howard Street, now a vacated public
space. The side of the church, chapel, garage, and rectory orient to Ste. Anne Street and form a strong, but not
straight, continuous wall of buildings. The hall and convent orient to Lafayette Boulevard with the side wall of the
rectory forming an additional element of that street face. Ste. Anne's Church serves as an impressive landmark as
viewed from the Fisher Freeway and the Ambassador Bridge when entering the United States from Canada.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. The front of the church is symmetrical in appearance. The front facades of the
hall, school, and convent are symmetrical. The rectory is asymmetrical, but was originally a balanced composition.
(22) General environmental character. The complex is located in a mixed-use area, with a declining residential area to the
east, west and north; commercial uses often associated with the Ambassador Bridge are nearby to the west and to the
south. New development is proposed for the area both for residential and commercial purposes. This is, and will likely
remain, a mixed-use urban area. The Ste. Anne's Parish Complex is a physical reminder of this religious institution's
role as a focal point of the community.
