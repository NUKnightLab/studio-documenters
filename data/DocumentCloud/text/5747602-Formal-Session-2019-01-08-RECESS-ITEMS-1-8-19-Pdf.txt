Program Overview, Objectives and Priorities

Overview
The FY 2018 Port Security Grant Program (PSGP) is set against the backdrop of a year in
which the United States faced numerous and unprecedented homeland security challenges.

Page 1 of 56
FY 2018 PSGP NOFO

These included the three major hurricanes that devastated parts of Texas, Florida, and much of
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as massive wild?res across the State of
California. In addition to these natural disasters, the Nation also responded to multiple
incidents as part of the evolving threat landscape, including witnessing the ?rst known terrorist
attack executed against mass transportation on our soil; cyberattacks against critical port
infrastructure; and mass casualty events involving both vehicles and active shooters.

The National Preparedness Goal (the Goal) de?nes what it means to be prepared for such
diverse and complicated events. The National Preparedness System is the instrument the
Nation employs to build, sustain, and deliver the core capabilities needed to achieve the goal of
a more secure and resilient Nation. The development and sustainment of these core capabilities
is not exclusive to any single level of government or organization, but rather requires the
combined effort of the whole community. To that end, the FY 20 8 PSGP represents one part
of a comprehensive set of measures authorized by Congress and implemented by the
Administration. Among the fiVe basic homeland security missions noted in the DHS
Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, the PSGP SUpports the goal to Strengthen National
Preparedness and Resilience.

The recently released 20 8?2112: l" EM A Strategic Plan creates a shared vision for the field of
emergency management and sets an ambitious, yet achievable, path forward to unify and
further professionalize emergency management across the country. The Port Security Grant
Program supports the goal of Readying the Nation for Catastrophic Disasters. We invite all of
our stakeholders and partners to also adopt these priorities and join us in building a stronger
Agency and a more prepared and resilient Nation.

Objectives

The PSGP provides funding to port authorities, facility operators, and State and local agencies
for activities associated with implementing Area Maritime Security Plans (AMSPs), facility
security plans and other port-wide risk management efforts.

The vast majority of U.S. maritime critical infrastructure is owned or operated by state, local,
territorial and private sector maritime industry partners. PSGP funds available to these entities
are intended to improve port-wide maritime security risk management; enhance maritime
domain awareness; support maritime security training and exercises; and maintain or
reestablish maritime security mitigation protocols that support port recoVery and resiliency
capabilities. Considering the current maritime security climate, the program?s concems focus
heavily on incidents involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), cybersecurity, and
attacks on so? targets.

Performance metrics for this program are as follows:
- Percentage of funding building new capabilities
- Percentage of funding sustaining existing capabilities

Priorities
Recipients of the FY 2018 PSGP are encouraged to accomplish these objectives through
activities such as:

Program Overview, Objectives and Priorities

Overview
The FY 2018 Port Security Grant Program (PSGP) is set against the backdrop of a year in
which the United States faced numerous and unprecedented homeland security challenges.

Page 1 of 56
FY 2018 PSGP NOFO

These included the three major hurricanes that devastated parts of Texas, Florida, and much of
Puerto Rico and the US. Virgin Islands, as well as massive wild?res across the State of
California. in addition to these natural disasters, the Nation also responded to multiple
incidents as part of the evolving threat landscape, including witnessing the ?rst known terrorist
attack executed against mass tranSportation on our soil; cyberattacks against critical port
infrastructure; and mass casualty events involving both vehicles and active shooters.

The National Preparedness Goal (the Goal) de?nes what it means to be prepared for such
diverse and complicated events. The National Preparedness System is the instrument the
Nation employs to build, sustain, and deliver the core capabilities needed to achieve the goal of
a more secure and resilient Nation. The development and sustainment of these core capabilities
is not exclusive to any single level of government or organization, but rather requires the
combined effort of the whole community. To that end, the FY 2018 PSGP represents one part
of a comprehensive set of measures authorized by Congress and implemented by the
Administration. Among the ?ve basic homeland security missions noted in the DHS
Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, the PSGP supports the goal to Strengthen National
Preparedness and Resilience.

The recently released 2th I 8-3132 Fi'ih?lix Strategic. Plan creates a shared vision for the ?eld of
emergency management and sets an ambitious, yet achievable, path forward to unify and
further professionalize emergency management across the country. The Port Security Grant
Program supports the goal of Readying the Nation for Catastrophic Disasters. We invite all of
our stakeholders and partners to also adopt these priorities and join us in building a stronger
Agency and a more prepared and resilient Nation.

Objectives

The PSGP provides funding to port authorities, facility operators, and State and local agencies
for activities associated with implementing Area Maritime Security Plans (AMSPs), facility
security plans and other port-wide risk management efforts.

The vast majority of US maritime critical infrastructure is owned or operated by state, local,
territorial and private sector maritime industry partners. PSGP funds available to these entities
are intended to improve port-wide maritime security risk management; enhance maritime
domain awareness; support maritime security training and exercises; and maintain or
reestablish maritime security mitigation protocols that support port recovery and resiliency
capabilities. Considering the current maritime security climate, the program?s concerns focus
heavily on incidents involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), cybersecurity, and
attacks on soft targets.

Performance metrics for this program are as follows:
0 Percentage of funding building new capabilities
- Percentage of handing sustaining existing capabilities

Priorities
Recipients of the FY 2018 PSGP are encourged to accomplish these objectives through
activities such as:
