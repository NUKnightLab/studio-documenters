SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) is a summary measure which compares
the actual number of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) in a facility
with the baseline data for standard population. SIR > 1.0 indicates more
HAIs were observed than predicted, conversely SIR of < 1.0 indicates that
fewer HAIs were observed than predicted.
