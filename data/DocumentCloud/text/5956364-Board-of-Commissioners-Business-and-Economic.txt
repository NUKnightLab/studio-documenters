WHEREAS, they also cause severe fiscal damage to local governments, reducing local tax revenues
while costing cities millions for policing, cleaning vacant lots, and demolishing derelict buildings; and
WHEREAS, most vacant buildings and houses are well maintained, but many are not and thousands can
sit empty for years, abandoned by their owners, deteriorating to the point where they cannot be reused
without major rehabilitation with many ultimately demolished, leaving vacant lots in their place; and
WHEREAS, besides their impact on social and economic conditions, vacant, abandoned properties have
a devastating effect on the fiscal condition of their cities, towns, and counties; and
WHEREAS, not only do they pay little in property taxes and generate little revenue for the city or county
when sold at tax sales, but they further reduce property tax collections by millions of dollars by devaluing
neighboring properties; and
WHEREAS, among the County’s tools to assist in jumpstarting economic development and turning
communities around are tax incentives; however, owners of vacant property, who receive said incentives
should not be able to indefinitely benefit from them without developing and re-purposing such properties;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that
Chapter 74 - Taxation, Article II - Real Property Taxation, Division 2 - Classification System for
