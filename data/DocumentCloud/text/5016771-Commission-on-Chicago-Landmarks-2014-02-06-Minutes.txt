The following project was reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1606-08 N. Milwaukee
(Milwaukee Avenue District – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation of an existing 12-story
building for hotel use including masonry work, storefront rehabilitation,
window replacement, new 1-story rooftop addition and roof deck, and a
vegetative ‘green’ roof.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, extensive masonry repair and replacement where
necessary shall be completed to address all exterior wall condition
issues. Samples of any replacement materials for the street-facing
facades such as any replacement brick and stone, mortar, sealant,
masonry patching and coating shall be reviewed and approved by
Historic Preservation staff prior to order and installation. After the
completion of the masonry work, final as-built elevation drawings
shall be submitted prior to Class L certification showing accurate
masonry repair and replacement units;
2. As proposed, the exterior masonry of the entire building shall be
cleaned with the gentlest means possible. Chemical cleaning product
specifications and material safety data sheet shall be provided with the
permit application for Historic Preservation staff review and approval;
3. Due to the fact that the masonry spandrel panel was likely originally
painted, a paint analysis of the windows, storefronts, cast iron
decorative elements and painted concrete spandrel panels will be
performed and the final color and finish of these façade elements will

 be determined based on the analysis results to be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff;
4. Replacement of wood double-hung windows with new aluminum
windows is approved as proposed. Existing and proposed window
details shall be included on permit plans;
5. Alterations of the two storefronts to eliminate recessed entries and
installation of new awnings are approved. As proposed, the remaining
historic storefronts at the 2-story base of the building shall be restored
wherever possible. Any historic elements that require replacement
(based on detailed survey of existing conditions) or elements that were
previously replaced shall be replaced to match historic in size, profile,
details, finish and materials. Details of existing and proposed
storefronts and proposed awnings shall be submitted with the permit
plans;
6. No hotel canopy is proposed as part of the Class L project. Should a
canopy be proposed in the future, the proposal will require a separate
review and a decision by the Permit Review Committee;
7. The proposed design, materials, locations, and installation details of
facade lighting shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff when available. Staff recommends that as part of
the Class L scope of work consideration be given to
restoring/installing lighting inside the historic lantern at the top of the
tower;
8. The new 1-story rooftop addition is approved as submitted on plans
dated January 17, 2014 in terms of overall size, scale, setback and
general design. To further mitigate the visibility of the addition, the
exterior cladding color palette shall be neutral beige with a nonreflective finish (similar to the darker brick color of the existing
penthouse). The new terrace railing should also be a neutral beige
color and is approved in location as proposed. Samples of the glass
and metal and brick cladding shall be submitted to Historic
Preservation staff with the permit application;
9. Any proposed signage shall be subject to Historic Preservation staff
review and approval when available; and,
10. The project requires a zoning change, and the Commission takes no
position regarding any requests relative to the zoning code
requirements or any approvals from other city agencies (such as
CDOT, CTA) that may be required.

2.

849 W. Armitage
(Armitage-Halsted District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new 3-story masonry building for retail use on the ground-floor
and 2 residential units on the upper floors.

 Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Considering the overall design and the proposed brick detailing of the
front façade, the Emperor size brick (2 ¼” x 15 5/8”) in a warm grey
color is approved as proposed in this instance. A sample of the marble
proposed for the storefront bulkhead shall be submitted for Historic
Preservation staff review and approval with the permit application;
2. The proposed rooftop stair enclosure shall be modified to incorporate a
sloping roof to minimize its size and visibility from the street. As
proposed, the masonry parapet wall shall provide a code-required
railing for the roof deck, and no other visible railings or structures
shall extend above the height of the parapet; and,
3. Signage shown on submitted drawings is informational only. Historic
Preservation staff shall review signage details when tenant signage is
available.

3.

1709 N. Hudson
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation including a new 2-story rear
addition with garage to existing 2½-story residential building and a new
20’-wide curb-cut from Fern Court.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Cornice, window, and wood trim details showing exterior profiles and
dimensions and the garage door cut sheet shall be submitted with the
permit application;
2. A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing the proposed
addition construction and excavation of the existing basement slab,
relative to how the historic building should be braced and protected
during construction, shall be submitted for Historic Preservation staff
review and approval, as part of the permit plans. The recommended
measures, sequencing, and protections shall be incorporated in the
structural and architectural drawings; and,
3. The project requires a zoning variation and/or adjustment, and the
Commission takes no position regarding any requested
variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code requirements.

4.

4148 S. Lake Park
(Oakland District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed 2-story single-family residence on a mid-block lot with a
detached garage.

 Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Fiber-cement siding may be used on secondary elevations where the
building code requires non-combustible siding. The siding shall have
a smooth finish and otherwise match the existing wood siding within
the district in size, profile, and finish. Details and material samples
shall be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff as part
of the permit application;
2. Brick and stone samples shall be submitted for Historic Preservation
staff review and approval prior to permit. The proposed brick and
stone shall be compatible with existing masonry within the district in
terms of size, color and finish, and the mortar color shall be
compatible with the brick color; and,
3. Window details to be submitted for review and approval with the
permit plans.

5.

3305 S. Calumet
(Calumet-Giles-Prairie District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed attached 1-story brick and limestone garage with a roof deck
for a corner property and a new curb-cut on 33rd Blvd.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Face brick, cast stone, mortar color and joint profiles shall match the
color, texture and joint profile of the historic masonry. Historic
Preservation staff shall be notified to view and approve material
samples on-site;
2. If the proposal requires approval from other city agencies (such as
Forestry or CDOT) the Commission takes no position regarding such
approvals; and,
3. Should the site plan require modifications the project shall return to
the Permit Review Committee for reconsideration.

6.

330 N. Wabash
(IBM Building – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Work contrary to approved plans: Proposed replacement glazing of the
glass partition wall in the first-floor lobby.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following condition:

 1.

A copy of the order for the new glazing, as identified on Sheet 2.03,
shall be included in the Commission’s review of the future Class L
Certification Request.
