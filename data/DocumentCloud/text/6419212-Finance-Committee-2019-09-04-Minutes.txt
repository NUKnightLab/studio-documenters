PROPOSED ORDINANCE SUBSTITUTE
REFUND RECOVERY AGENT REFUND CHECK REISSUANCE FEE ORDINANCE

WHEREAS, Cook County (?the County?) is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to
Article VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such, may exercise any power
and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

WHEREAS, the efficient and effective operation of the Cook County Treasurer?s Office
pertains to the County?s government and affairs; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Illinois Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/ 20-175, the CCTO is
responsible for issuing property tax refunds arising from overpayments and erroneous
Page 88 of 100

assessments to eligible refund applicants, including, but not limited to, refund recovery agents, as
hereinafter defined, and taxpayers; and

WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas (?Treasurer?)
that the CCTO mailed nearly 1,000 refund checks in January and February of 2018 to a law firm
for refunds arising from successful tax objections filed with respect to condominiums at 180 East
Pearson Street, and that that law firm did not deliver these refund checks to the property
management company for the subject condominiums, Lieberman Condominium and Property
Management Services (?Lieberman?), until August of 2018, and subsequently, Lieberman
failed to distribute these refund checks to the taxpayers of these properties until December of
2018 and January of 2019, almost a year afterthe issuance date of the checks; and

WHEREAS, in the wake of this event, the CCTO conducted research and found that, on
average, refund recovery agents, such as the law firm mentioned above, fail to cash or deposit
refund checks for a longer duration than other refund applicants; and

WHEREAS, refund recovery agents who fail to distribute refund checks issued by the CCTO to
their clients in a timely manner or otherwise delay the negotiation of refund checks issued by the
CCTO undermine the efficient administration of the statutory duty to issue refunds to
County taxpayers; and

WHEREAS, refund recovery agents submit a significant number of requests to the CCTO for
the cancellation and reissuance of refund checks previously issued by the CCTO, but never
cashed or deposited; and

WHEREAS, the resources must be employed and expenses incurred to conduct
research regarding whether the applicant for the reissuance of the check is the proper claimant,
and to complete the administrative processes necessary to reissue refund checks; and

WHEREAS, enhancements to the existing core information technology systems would enable
the CCTO to upgrade its electronic systems, which would result in significant operational
efficiencies, cost reductions, and improved services, including, but not limited to:

(l)facilitating the electronic exchange of refund application information between refund
applicants and the CCTO to expedite the issuance of refunds to refund applicants; and

(2)enabling the electronic exchange of a twenty-year history of property tax collection
and payment information to taxpayers; and

(3)enabling the electronic exchange of available refund information, including those

arising from overpayments, overassessments, Property Tax Appeal Board decisions, and court
orders.

himself or herself.

Fee. The County Treasurer shall charge and collect a fee of $30.00 for any request made by a
