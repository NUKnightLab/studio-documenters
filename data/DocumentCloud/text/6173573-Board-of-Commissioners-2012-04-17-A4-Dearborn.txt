GENERAL BACKGROUND
Dearbom Homes, a Family housing development, consists of six hundred sixty-eight (668) units
completed in 1948. Located on 16 acres of land, the property has sixteen (16) midrise buildings, twelve
(12) residential buildings that are six (6) stories in height with basements, and four (4) buildings that are
nine (9) stories in height without basements.

GENERAL REHABILITATION PROJECTS
Starting in 2007, through 2011, the development received a comprehensive ?gut? rehabilitation, including
replacement of all building systems. As a result, the development should require minimal capital
investment in the near term. A summary of the work follows:

2007-08 Phase 1, full gut/rehabilitation and site work (2 buildings, 78 units for $20.7 million).
2008-09 Phase 2, full gut/rehabilitation and site work (3 buildings, 124 units for $31.7 million).
2009-10 Phase 3, full gut/rehabilitation and site work (3 buildings, 128 units for $28.4 million).
2010-11 Phase 4, full gut/rehabilitation and site work (4 buildings, 172 units for $32.5 million).
2010-11 Phase 5, full gut/rehabilitation and site work (4 buildings, 166 units for $29.2 million).
2011 Computer Lab build out at 2910 S. Dearborn for $180,000.00.

Total improvements to date $142.68 million.

The Asset Management and Capital Construction Departments are assessing what, if any, additional
capital improvements are necessary at the development. Possible future improvements may include more
ef?cient approaches to trash removal and provision of building supplies, as well as additional site security
measures.

FIRE LANE HISTORY

After several phases of comprehensive modernization at Dearbom Homes, property management and the
Asset Management Department (?Asset Management?) requested that the Capital Construction
Department review the ?re lanes traversing throughout the property to improve site drainage,
eliminate water ?ponding? issues after storm events, and improve pavement surfaces that were cut in
many locations from the recent rehabilitation activity, contributing to the site drainage issues. The
rehabilitation left many of the ?re lanes with ponding areas that will accumulate water and sometimes
freeze during winter conditions, resulting in some hazardous conditions for residents and the
neighborhood. The parties agreed to address the ?re lanes once the rehabilitation was completed so as not
to damage any newly installed ?re lanes. CCD and Asset Management worked with the Prime Design
Consultant, Hasbrouk Peterson Zimoch Sirrattumrong to come up with a solution that
addresses these concerns.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Ponding continues to be a problem throughout the property, concentrating at the existing ?re lanes at
Dearbom Homes. There are:
0 Drainage issues at the north end of the ?re lane.
0 Drainage issues adjacent to Chicago Park District property.
0 Drainage issues at the south end of the ?re lane.

Two (2) options have been presented to address the continuing drainage problem at Dearborn Homes? ?re
lanes:

 

 

6?05. Van Bhre?tr?e?t- 'bnicago, Illinois 60605-1207- (312) 742-8500- 

Option A (renovate the fire lanes)

Improve site drainage characteristics and eliminate safety concerns from poor drainage, especially
in the winter months when ponding water will freeze, creating slip and fall incidents for the
residents.

0 Install additional storm piping and basin to reduce drainage issues.

Improve pavement slopes and drainage characteristics.

Improve pedestrian circulation by better alignment of sidewalks with ramps and crosswalks.
Install ?loading areas? and signage on the ?re lane to assist residents.

Initial capital investment cost of $1,437,500.

0000

Option (maintain current conditions)

Continue current practice of managing the ponding areas by repeatedly pumping out the ?ponded?
areas.

Increased operational costs for pumping out ponded areas, and in the winter months increased
costs to mitigate icy areas by the property manager.

Continued drainage issues

Potential liabilities for slip, trip and fall incidents

Advantage would be no capital investment cost

The Capital Construction Department recommends renovating the ?re lanes (Option A).

Increases the performance of storm water management by removing storm water at a greater rate
than currently being experienced.

Eliminates water ?ponding? and icy areas.

Improves alignment with sidewalk ramps and crosswalks.

Provides ?loading zones? for residents, with signage to improve management by the property
manager on vehicles parking in the ?re lane and blocking access for emergency vehicles.

Has the support of Asset Management and property management.

The work will include, but not be limited to:

Demolishing and removing old pavement surface.
Installing storm piping and a storm retention basin.
Installing new concrete pavement.

Site restoration along the ?re lane area.

The construction duration will be six (6) months from issuance of the Notice to Proceed All ?re
lane construction will commence at NTP and will contain three (3) phases of construction. Phase 1 will
be the East ?re lane, Phase 2 will be the West ?re lane and Phase 3 will be along the Chicago Park
District?s property. No resident relocation will be required for the duration of the project. The General
Contractor will be required to maintain trash and emergency services to the property during the entire
duration of the project.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid No. 12?00884 on January 31, 2012. Advertisements ran in the
Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, Extra, on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online. The
Pre-Bid meeting and the Site Visit were held on February 9, 2012. Addendum No. 1 was issued on
February 13, 2012 to distribute revised drawings that included a plat of survey and technical
speci?cations. On February 22, 2012, Addendum No. 2 was issued to respond to Requests for
Information. The CHA received and opened six (6) bids on March 1, 2012.

After performing an initial review of the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and
Contacts (?Procurement?), Asset Management and CCD held a pre-award surveyfclari?cation meeting
with the apparent low bidder, Pan Oceanic Engineering Co. Inc. The representatives of that ?rm
responded to questions on the thoroughness of their bid, how they developed their Division Costs, the
amount of work they planned to self-perform, the method they would use in phasing the project to avoid
interrupting resident access, safety on the job site, especially for children, and removal of trash for those
affected construction areas. A Compliance Specialist reviewed the ?rm?s compliance materials in detail.

Pan?Oceanic Engineering Co. is a new vendor to the CHA. CCD staff has reviewed and called references
provided by Pan?Oceanic Engineering Co. Currently, Pan-Oceanic Engineering Co. is performing a
project for the Chicago Department of Transportation entitled Roadway Reconstruction
Cermak Road/Blue Island. This is a pilot program utilizing LEED fundamentals using Green and regional
materials. The contract amount for the roadway reconstruction is $8,094,040.40. The scope of work is
similar to the project at Dearborn Homes ?re lanes. They both include curbs and gutters, street lighting
and road replacement. CCD checked references and found Pan-Oceanic Engineer Co.?s performance to be
satisfactory. Pan-Oceanic Engineer Co.?s ?nancials have been fully analyzed and ?nd to be acceptable.

Having completed its review of the bid materials of the apparent low bidder, the CCD staff recommends
that Pan-Oceanic Engineering Co. be awarded a contract for this work. Procurement has completed its
own review of the bid materials and recommendation, and has determined that Pan-Oceanic
Engineering Co. is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $1,437,500.00.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the CHA recommends that the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief
Executive Of?cer or his designee to enter into a contract with Pan-Oceanic Engineering Co. in the amount
of $1,437,500.00 for ?re lane renovations at Dearbom Homes, a Family housing development located at
2960 S. Federal Street in Chicago, IL. Work is to be completed by no later than one hundred eighty (180)
calendar days from the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.

This award is subject to the Contractor?s compliance with the Section 3 resident
hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
