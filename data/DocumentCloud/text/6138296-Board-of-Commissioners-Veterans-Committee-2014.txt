RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE RECORDER OF DEEDS AND DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS
AFFAIRS TO IMPLEMENT A VETERANS’ AND MILITARY DISCOUNT CARD PROGRAM
WHEREAS, though there is no way to adequately repay our nation’s military personnel for their service and
sacrifice, we can demonstrate our gratitude by forging a collaborative effort between businesses and government
that will connect veterans and active-duty military personnel with merchants who choose to honor their military
service through special discounts and promotions; and

 WHEREAS, the discount card program, to be named after adoption of this resolution by mutual assent of the
relevant County departments and agencies including, but not limited to, the Bureau of Administration, the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, and the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ Office, will provide veterans - those
honorably discharged and other veterans generally discharged for reasons other than discipline, misconduct,
resignation in lieu of misconduct charges, unfitness for duty, voluntary resignation, or court martial - and military
personnel currently serving our country, with discount cards that can be used at recruited merchants throughout
Cook County who agree to honor the card by providing holders with a discount on goods and services, or another
appropriate money-saving promotion of their choice; and
WHEREAS, the veterans’ and military discount card program will be mutually beneficial, helping veterans save
money with discounts on goods and services, and helping business owners to enjoy increased traffic and sales in
their stores; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ Office operates a Veterans Service Office, whose main
function is to record, safeguard and retrieve DD-214 military discharge records, which are documents issued to
servicemen or women upon completion of their service; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ Office will issue and produce the veteran identification cards;
the Cook County Recorder will use DD-214 military discharge records in conjunction with photo identification
such as a driver’s license, state ID card, federal military or Veterans Affairs ID, or passport, to issue the card to
veterans; in the case of active-duty military, a valid military ID or other official government identification that
denotes active-duty service, and photo ID if needed, will be used; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Veterans Affairs Division within the Cook County Bureau of Administration
already has the outreach capabilities to let our servicemen and veterans know about this program, and the
Recorder’s Office will assist with promoting this and other Cook County veterans’ benefits; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Office of the Cook County Board President may
also disseminate information and assist in this program; and
WHEREAS, this program is dedicated to the nearly 225,000 veterans in Cook County, who represent almost
one-third of all Illinois veterans, and to the active-duty personnel currently serving, as well as to those who have
made the ultimate sacrifice; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that the Cook
County Veterans Affairs Division and the Cook County Recorder of Deeds honor those who serve this great
nation by implementing a veterans’ discount card program.
