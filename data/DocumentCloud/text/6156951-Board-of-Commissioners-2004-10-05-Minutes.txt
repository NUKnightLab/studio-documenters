OFFICE OF THE CHIEF JUDGE
GRANT APPLICATION

Transmitting a Communication, dated September 9, 2004 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to apply for a grant in the amount of $62,575.00 from the Administrative Office
of the Illinois Courts (AOIC). This grant is funded through the Illinois State Court Improvement Program
(CIP) and will fund the production of a training video for the Child Protection Mediation Program of the
Circuit Court of Cook County's Chi ld Protection Division.
In 2001 , the Child Protection Mediation Program began providing a forum where family members and
professionals involved in contested child protection matters can resolve differences outside of a
courtroom setting. Mediations typically involve disputes regarding pennanency options, services,
placement, visitations, case closure, and communication. Because mediation is relatively new in the child
welfare area, caseworkers, advocates, therapists, attorneys, and other participants are often unfamiliar
with the process. This video would train mediation participants how to prepare for child protection
mediation and how to respond to unexpected situations which frequently arise. The video would be
produced by a local company with experience in such productions.
Mediation sessions are court-ordered. The number of sessions has increased significantly since the
program 's inception. For the first eight months of these calendar years, 179 were held, compared to 160
for all 2003.
This grant does not require a match contribution.
The Budget Department has reviewed this item, and all requisite documents have been submitted.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award:
through September 14, 2005 .

$62,575.00. Funding period: September 15, 2004

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved that the request of the Chief
Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING RFP FOR BUREAU PHARMACY SERVICES
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Gregg
Goslin, County Commissioner; and Co-sponsored by Jerry Butler, Forrest Claypool, Earlean
Collins, John P. Daley, Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman, Carl R. Hansen, Roberto Maldonado,
Joseph Mario Moreno, Joan Patricia Murphy, Anthony J. Peraica, Mike Quigley, Peter N .
Silvestri, Deborah Sims, Bobbie L. Steele and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Authorizing RFP for Bureau Pharmacy Services
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services operates five out-patient
phannacies at various locations including the Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center, Provident
Hospital of Cook County, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and two at Stroger Hospital
of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, in 2003 the Bureau of Health Service' s pharmacies filled 2.2 million
prescriptions; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services must cope with a chronic shortage
of phannacists and it has become increasingly difficult to fill phannacy positions due to a
high demand in both the public and private sectors; and
WHEREAS, the private sector is currently experiencing rapid expansion of free-standing
pham1acy outlets throughout the region which has significantly increased the number of
pharmacies currently located in neighborhoods throughout Cook County; and
WHEREAS, this expansion is fueled, in part, by competition among three major phannacy
chains.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that in an effort to control costs and develop
efficient delivery of medicine to Bureau of Health Services patients the Cook County Board
of Commissioners does hereby authorize the Bureau of Health Services to issue a Request for
Proposals (RFPs) lnfonnation from private sector entities for the pharmacy needs of the
Bureau of Health Services, and report to the Board of Commissioners on the feasibility of
implementing a program.

*Referred to the Committee on Health and Hospitals on 09/08/04.
Chainnan Butler asked Dr. Daniel H. Winship, M.D., Chief, Bureau of Health Services, (Bureau) to
address the committee.
Dr. Winship began by introducing Daniel R. Martin, Acting Chief Operating Officer, Oak Forest Hospital
of Cook County; Martin Grant, Director of Phannacy, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County; and Alvin
Holley, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Health Services.

2864

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2004

Dr. Winship stated the following: The pharmacy program in the Bureau requires modification. The
operations are far from optimal. The proposed authority would be welcomed provided the Bureau was
able to move forward and make needed repairs. Several issues will be impacted and will require
consideration of the proposal. The first is that the mail-order phannacy will be online December of 2004,
and the Bureau expects the mail-order pharmacy to impact the operation of the Bureau' s entire
pharmaceutical program. Further, there are two separate issues with funding that the Bureau needs to
address: I) a large component of the Bureau's funding the revenue which the Bureau receives for
pharmacy is in the Intergovernmental Transfer Program (IGT). About $96 million supports the pharmacy
through that program. 2) The other program that the Bureau participates in is the HRSA (Health
Resource and Service Administration) 340B which provides the Bureau with a major phannaceutical
discount of about 30% for a large portion of the patients. It is administered by the Office of Pharmacy
Affairs, and their regulations do not allow outsourcing. Finally, the Bureau would need a waiver from the
Office of Pharmacy Affairs if possible, because there is no large public hospital healthcare system in the
country that is doing that. In regards to the union contract, the pharmacy is unionized, so outsourcing
would create some difficulties. In conclusion, within this current year the phannacists have received a
substantial pay increase which puts the phannacist at the Bureau at a very competitive position for the
recruitment of phannacists.
Dr. Winship continued by stating the following: The pharmaceutical program needs a Supervisory
change or an administrative change. Integration can go a long way towards making the improvements
that are needed. In conclusion, the authority would be welcomed as the Bureau attempts to make major
changes in how the pharmacy program operates in the Bureau. We are attempting to provide better
service and make it more patient-friendly. At the same time, Dr. Winship believes that the other changes
that he has talked about need to take place immediately.
Chainnan Butler called on Vice Chaim1an Goslin to make some remarks in regards to his proposed
resolution.
Vice Chainnan Goslin stated that the resolution is to increase access to medications for the outpatients of
the Bureau of Health. He stated that it is to take advantage of the explosion in free-standing pharmacies
throughout the County. Further, he stated that he does support the mail order, but that there are times that
an individual cannot wait for a mail order service.
Commissioner Sims asked about McKesson's function m the total role of Health and Hospitals as
opposed to what is being discussed with the outpatient pharmacy.
Daniel Martin, Acting Chief Operating Officer, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, stated the
following: McKesson is a wholesaler. The Bureau purchases drugs in different ways. For instance all
outpatient medication for all of the facilities, with the exception of patients at Cemrnk Health Services of
Cook County, is purchased under the 340B Drug Program. The 340B Program has a set price. The
Bureau also purchases drugs for inpatient use through a Group Purchasing Organization (GPO), which is
part of the McKesson program. It negotiates inpatient drug prices for certain medications for all of the
members that belong to the Group Purchasing Organization (GPO). Once the Bureau receives the
pricings then they are given to whatever wholesaler a hospital or healthcare system selects. They are
entered into their computer system, which in this case would be McKesson's. Each month McKesson
receives an update on all of the 340B pricing that is entered in the computer system, and also receives an
update on all of their Group Purchasing Organization (GPO), which is also entered into their computer
system; when an order is placed for drugs the Bureau is then charged that price. In conclusion, the
wholesaler is a means to deliver the product and distribute the drugs to the Bureau.

2865

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2004

Mr. Martin stated the following: Currently Public Aid patients can access any program m their
community that participates in the State Public Aid Program. Only 15% of the Bureau's outpatient
volumes being seen are Medicaid patients. The $20 million of revenue that Dr. Winship mentioned is
revenue that was generated through the pharmacy system for the Medicaid patients. One of the benefits
of going with the mail order program is that the Bureau will be able to attract patients who are going to
their local phannacies to have their prescriptions filled. Medicaid patients could participate in a mail
order phannacy. The Bureau of Health Services would be able to generate additional revenue by having
the Bureau service them. Further, 85% of the patients that the Bureau sees are either self-pay patients or
Medicare patients, which mean that the Bureau is not receiving any reimbursement for those patients
because they are paying on a sliding-fee scale based on what their bill is with the County in accordance
with the County policies. In conclusion, under the proposed resolution, if a patient were to go to a local
pharmacy to have a prescription filled, if the Bureau had a contractual relationship with them, one of the
issues that the Bureau would have to consider is that the Bureau is able to purchase drugs at a much lesser
cost than Walgreen's can because of its participation in the 340B Program. All of the Bureaus
pharmacies are associated with one of the three hospitals, Provident Hospital of Cook County, Stroger
Hospital of Cook County or Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County. All three of those hospitals are
disproportionate share hospitals, and because of that designation, the Bureau is eligible to participate in
the 340B Program. Any patient who seeks services at any of the Bureaus outpatient pharmacies is able to
purchase drugs at a much lesser cost under the 340B Program.
Mr. Martin continued with the following: If the Bureau entered into an agreement with Osco or
Walgreens the Bureau would have to go to the Federal Government to the Office of Phannacy Affairs and
apply for a Demonstration Project Status. The Bureau would request to implement that type of program.
As a result of that the Bureau would then like to extend the Bureaus 340B purchasing rights over to the
contracted organization. Patients would then be able to purchase drugs at that cost. This year the Bureau
is projecting that 2.8 million prescriptions will be filled in the outpatient phannacies, which is the
equivalent of forty-four full-time Osco or Walgreen ' s. Currently the Bureau does not have the authority
to extend the 340B purchasing rights to Walgreen's, but Walgreen' s and Osco have something similar;
they purchase their drugs through a wholesaler and they negotiate the drug's cost.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that the first step that the Bureau should take is to see if it is possible or
conceivable to start dispensing prescriptions through the thirty clinics that are in the Bureau, and possibly
assigning phannacy technicians to each one of the pharmacies. Patients would not need to travel to pick
up a prescription. The Bureau needs an opportunity to implement the programs it has.
Commissioner Daley suggested that the proposed resolution should be explored by the Bureau and then
have Dr. Winship report back to the Board of Commissioners. He asked if there will be a decline in
reimbursement by going to the mail order.
Mr. Martin stated that the revenue would increase.
Commissioner Claypool asked the status regarding being able to have prescriptions filled at the clinics in
the neighborhood.
Mr. Martin stated that the prescriptions are filled and packaged at one of the hospital sites and then
delivered to a location and dispensed. Further, Mr. Martin stated that there are operational issues related
to the dispensing of prescriptions in the sense that it doesn' t comply very closely with the State regulation
related to the dispensing of medication. He stated that medication is only allowed to be dispensed either
by licensed pharmacists, a technician who is working directly under the supervision of a phannacist
who's on site, or by a physician.

2866

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2004

Commissioner Claypool asked if a licensed phannacist at one of the clinics dispenses the same drugs
under contractual relationship basically as the administrative mechanism to accomplish this and to
comply with those regulations.
Chairman Butler stated that when Ms. Ruth Rothstein was the Chief of the Bureau of Health Services a
concept similar to this one was taken to Walgreen 's and they did not accept it.
In regards to the Bureau's pharmacy, Dr. Winship stated the there are three fundamental things that need
to happen in order for the pharmacy to work better: 1) the mail order phannacy produces 50-60% of
prescription refills by mail order; 2) the Bureau pays pharmacists at a market rate so that the number of
phannacists increases; 3) the operation of the whole pharmacy program is integrated, improved, and
changed with a new leadership type organization, which the Bureau will be working toward during the
next few months.
Commissioner Moreno asked the time frame for implementing these goals.
Dr. Winship stated that implementing these goals within six months and certainly through the first year
will be one of the top priorities.
Commissioner Moreno asked whether a cost analysis could be done regarding what the County would
need to pay phannacists to increase the volume of pharmacists compared to the revenue it generated by
selling more drugs. Would that offset the increase in salaries?
Mr. Martin stated that the demand for phannacy services keeps increasing every year, for instance for FY
2004 the Bureau was projecting $2.2 million and year-end will be $2.8 million. In regards to the cost
analysis, when the evaluation was being done for the mail order pharmacy service the Bureau looked at
what the cost of filling a prescription and what it would be under the mail order program. The Bureau
will not know until the bid comes back. Mr. Martin stated that the mail order phannacy services are a
tum key operation. The company that receives the bid will set up an operation at the Oak Forest Hospital
of Cook County campus and will completely staff it with their pharmacists, technicians and support
personnel.
Commissioner Moreno asked if the Bureau increased salaries to attract more pham1acists, would the
Bureau generate enough revenue to cover the cost of the increase salaries and additional pharmacists.
Mr. Martin stated that he wasn't able to answer Commissioner Moreno's question.
In response to Commissioner Steele's question regarding the salaries of phannacists, Martin Grant,
Director of Phamiacy, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, stated that currently the Bureau is at the end
of the contract cycle for the pharmacists' union. Negotiations will begin at the end of the month and
traditionally the salaries slightly decreased some at the end of the contract cycle. Further, he stated that
the Bureau is anticipating that with the contract negotiations that the Bureau will make up the difference
that there is at this point. However, he stated that the Bureau ' s current wages with the benefit package are
competitive in the market place.
Vice Chainnan Goslin asked if the supervisors received an increase at the same time the pharmacists did.
Mr. Grant responded no, but that the Bureau will be working on an increase for the supervisors.

2867

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2004

In regards to Commissioner Steele's question concerning the senior care program, Mr. Martin stated that
it is called the State' s Senior Care Program. Patients can enroll by filing various fonns with the state and

P. Daley, Elizabeth Ann Doody Gonnan, Roberto Maldonado, Joan Patricia Murphy, Peter N.
Silvestri and Deborah Sims, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

THE LOBBYIST CONSOLIDATION RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, different branches of Cook County government employ non county employee
paid outside lobbyists to lobby on county issues before the state legislature; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approves more than $400,000 a year
from the budget for contracts to retain separate lobbyists for branches of Cook County
government; and
WHEREAS, because the lobbyi ng agenda is not centrally managed, the county ' s message is
often diluted or inconsistent; and
WHEREAS, sometimes County officials use paid outside lobbyists to promote positions in
direct opposition to those of the Cook County Board; and
WHEREAS, Cook County needs to present a unified front on pending state legislation; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has oversight authority over all
branches of Cook County government and the responsibility for the prudent budgeting and
management of tax dollars; and
WHEREAS, trying to maintain a balanced budget, the Cook County Board of
Commissioners should not authorize the payment of large lobbyist contracts; and
WHEREAS, constitutionally Cook County elected officials can deploy trained County staff
to monitor pending legislation if they so choose; and
WHEREAS, a plethora of lobbyists make it impossible for the County to speak with one
unified voice in Springfield ; and
WHEREAS, the Office of the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners
currently employs two lobbyists who should solely represent the interests of Cook County.

2870

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2004

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:
Beginning July 1, 2004, following the end of the Illinois General Assembly spring session,
the Cook County Board of Commissioners will no longer approve lobbying contracts
submitted by branches of Cook County government. The Office of the President of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, with approval from the Board, will retain two lobbyists to
represent Cook County on pending state legislative matters. No lawyer or lobbyist hired to
represent the County may represent, as private counsel on non-government issues, any
County elected official or political committee of any County elected official while they
represent the County.

*Referred to the Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations on June
15, 2004.
Chairman Suffredin requested that a letter from Dorothy Brown, Clerk of the Circuit Court, be entered
into the record. (The referenced documents are on file with the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Claypool stated the following: The Board is responsible for watching the budget and
setting policy for the County. It is inconsistent for the Board to approve outside lobbyists for elected
officials who often work in contravention of Board policy and expend significant taxpayer dollars in the
enterprise. While constitutionally elected officials have every right to lobby, the Board should not be in
the business of paying for those lobbyists. This resolution says that it is the will of the Board to not
provide funds for such lobbying.
Commissioner Daley asked to be added as a co-sponsor. He stated that he believes that the Board should
speak with one voice, and that funding should not be provided for outside lobbyists, especially since they
often are lobby ing at cross purposes to the Board's.
Commissioner Silvestri stated his support for this measure. He stated the following: Elected offi cials
should be encouraged to send their staff to the office of the chief lobbyist. It is inappropriate for other
elected official s to send staff directly to Springfield when there is a central lobbying office for the entire
County. Measures brought forth by other elected officials should be cleared through this committee,
especially since funding originates with this office. Labor relations attorneys from various offices shou ld
be consolidated next.
Chairman Suffredin called on the public speakers:
