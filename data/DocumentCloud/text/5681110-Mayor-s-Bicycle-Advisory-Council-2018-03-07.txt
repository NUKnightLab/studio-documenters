•

Biking less than half the speed limit

•

Can pass without speeding

•

Safe to do so (other passing laws)

 New state laws for 2018
2) Taillight instead of reflector okay
(previously, only for Chicago)
3) Biking on shoulder legal

 Legality important post-crash, etc.

STRONGESTPREDICTORS
1.

Housing density meaningfully explains variations in ridership across the Divvy service area;

2.

Transit linkages and, specifically, job accessibility via transit, are some of the strongest predictors
of ridership;

3.

Unemployment, high economic hardship, foreclosures and proportion of the population that is
nonwhite are negatively associated with ridership;

4.

Areas with higher bikeshare station densities are associated with greater levels of ridership;

5.

Percentage of commuters who drive alone to work is are negatively associated with ridership;

6.

Bike lanes and other cycling treatments and infrastructure around bikeshare stations is associated
with greater performance;

 Areas with higher proportions of dependent populations (kids and older adults) are negatively
correlated with ridership;
