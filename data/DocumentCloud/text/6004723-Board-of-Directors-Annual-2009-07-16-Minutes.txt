UPDATE ON STATE BUDGET

and intergovernmental agreements with the System and other entities. After the budget was signed, the
Governor also signed HB2206, so the System is now in a position to draw down the Medicaid payments.

Foundation received $3.5 million in the State capital spending bill for refurbishment of facilities.

in jeopardy as a result of the State budget. Chairman Batts added that this should be a list of grants
System-wide.
On the subject of grants, Mr. Foley stated that at some point, the Board or Finance Committee should

Hektoen. Director Muñoz informed the Board that the Audit and Compliance Committee is currently
looking at Hektoen; there should be a report on the subject by the end of the month.

provisions of the FMLA.

2.

Employees with accumulated sick leave must use such leave during the
FMLA leave, but need not exhaust all of their accumulated vacation leave
prior to or during the FMLA leave.

3.

If spouses are both employed by the County, FMLA leave for the birth or
adoption of a child or to care for a member of the Employee’s immediate
family is limited to an aggregate for both Employees of 12 weeks in a 12month period. Leave for the birth or adoption of a child shall be taken within
12 months of the birth or placement.

34

 55
Draft 07-08-09

4.

Employees may take FMLA leave in one continuous block or intermittently,
as needed and permitted under the FMLA. Intermittent leave may also take
the form of a reduced work schedule. Employees should make every effort to
avoid disruption of Department operations in requesting intermittent leave or
a reduced work schedule. A Department may temporarily reassign an
Employee on a reduced work schedule to other duties that better
accommodate the reduced schedule. Employees must take FMLA leave for
the birth or adoption of a child in a single block unless intermittent FMLA
leave is approved by the Department Head. Employees with approved
intermittent FMLA leave must still comply with a Department’s procedures
for requesting sick leave except in an emergency. Employees may use
intermittent FMLA leave only to the extent and for the purposes outlined in
their approved leave requests and may be required to submit documentation
with respect to their use of intermittent FMLA leave consistent with
applicable law.

5.

Requests for FMLA leave shall be made in accordance with the time frames
applicable to requests for leave generally. Regardless of how a leave request
is characterized, leave to which an Employee is entitled under the FMLA is
counted for purposes of determining whether the Employee has exhausted
his/her entitlement to leave under the FMLA. However, to the extent the
County permits an Employee to request longer periods of unpaid leave, an
Employee’s leave request shall not be limited by the FMLA.

6.

A doctor's certification must be provided in support of a request for FMLA
leave. The County reserves the right to require a second opinion at County
expense and a third opinion, again at County expense, should the two
opinions conflict.

7.

During FMLA leave, the County will continue to pay its share of an
Employee’s health insurance premiums. Employees must arrange with the
Benefits office to pay their share of premiums normally paid through payroll
deduction. The County may recover the cost of paid health insurance
premiums from Employees who do not return to work at the end of a period
of FMLA in accordance with the provisions of the FMLA.

8.

Employees will not lose accumulated vacation leave during an FMLA leave.
No additional vacation or sick leave shall accrue during periods of unpaid
FMLA leave. Except as provided under the FMLA, Employees will be
entitled to reinstatement to the same Position or equivalent Position upon the
return from FMLA leave consistent with the requirements of the FMLA.
Periods of unpaid FMLA leave lasting more than thirty (30) days will be
deducted in computing Continuous Service Credit and will effect a change in
the Anniversary and Seniority Dates.

9.

Pursuant to the record keeping requirements of the FMLA, all FMLA-related
requests, reports and certifications shall be forwarded to the HR Director who
may refer them to Employee Health Service for review and maintenance.

10.

Employees may only use FMLA leave for the purposes set forth in the
approved requests. Employees must file additional FMLA requests to cover
situations that may qualify for FMLA leave but are not covered by the
approved request. Employees are entitled to a maximum total of twelve
weeks of FMLA leave per year regardless of the number of FMLA requests
that are made.

Military Leave
1.

The System Board shall grant military leave, with or without pay to the same
extent such leaves are granted to other System Employees or as provided
under applicable law. Military leave that is permissibly taken under the
FMLA is counted as part of, and not in addition to, any entitlement an
Employee may have to FMLA leave. Reinstatement rights shall be as
provided by the System Board or pursuant to applicable law.

2.

Any Employee granted a leave of absence to enter service in the Armed
Forces of the United States, either voluntarily or by reason of conscription,
shall upon return to County service, be restored to the Position held prior to
going on leave with the same anniversary and seniority dates, status and pay
as if the Employee had been employed continuously by Cook County.

3.

The Employee must present a copy of military orders when requesting a
leave. The Employee must file written request for reinstatement to a former
position or re-employment within 60 days after termination of military or
naval service, along with a copy of military discharge papers.

Disability Leave
a.

Ordinary Disability
Employees who are disabled due to a non-work related health condition shall be
entitled to request a leave of absence for the period during which they use their
accumulated sick leave and, in addition, for the period during which they are
receiving ordinary disability benefits from the Cook County Annuity and Benefit
Fund (“Fund”). Employees should contact the Fund to obtain application and benefit
information, eligibility rules and other documentation.

36

 57
Draft 07-08-09

In addition to any application that is made to the Fund, Employees must request a
disability leave of absence from the Affiliate COO. Disability leave that is
permissibly taken under the FMLA is counted as part of, and not in addition to, any
entitlement an Employee may have to FMLA leave.
An Employee who is on approved disability leave and returns to work within 60
calendar days after disability leave is terminated shall be eligible to receive the salary
paid at the time disability leave started, provided the budget of the Department can
accommodate the salary and, if not, the Employee shall be eligible to have the salary
received at the time disability leave started restored at the earliest possible date.

following a job-related injury or illness.

3.

Any Employee who is entitled to temporary total disability benefits may be

with the Fund.

4.

An Employee who is entitled to temporary total disability benefits shall not
be entitled to utilize accumulated sick, vacation or other paid leave during the
period for which temporary total disability benefits are payable.
An Employee’s request for temporary total disability benefits is subject to
review by the Cook County Injury Compensation Committee. The
Committee is authorized to require a physical examination to determine
eligibility for benefits.

5.

Maintenance of Records
Records of Employee leaves shall be maintained by the HR Director.

37

 58
Draft 07-08-09

Employees must inform their Supervisors and Department Heads of their intention to request
a leave and must comply with the requirements of the HR Director with respect to
applications, documentation and Medical Examinations. The Employee must provide the
HR Director with a current address and telephone number and maintain current contact
information while on leave. The Department Head may require an Employee who is on
leave of absence to report in on a reasonable periodic basis. All leaves of absence shall be
subject to the approval of the HR Director and the appropriate Affiliate COO.
An Employee who wishes to request an extension of a leave must notify their Supervisor
and Department Heads and submit the required application for extension at least thirty (30)
days before their leave is scheduled to expire, unless a medical emergency precludes such
notice. Employees must contact their Departments at least two weeks before returning from
leave and complete all processing required by the HR Director, including Medical
Examinations, before they can return. Failure to comply with these provisions may lead to
disciplinary action, delays in reporting and forfeiture of pay.
6.07

Medical Examinations; Return to Duty Following Leave
The System may require an Employee who requests or who is on leave of absence for
medical reasons to submit to a Medical Examination to review the Employee’s health status.
Failure to submit to a Medical Examination, or a determination that the Employee is no
longer disabled, may result in denial of leave or termination of approved leave. Prior to
returning to duty from a leave of absence for medical reasons, an Employee must submit to a
Medical Examination by Employee Health Service to obtain clearance to return to duty.

g.

8.05

No Employee may be discharged, demoted or suspended for more than ten
days for disciplinary reasons unless the statement of charges and any
supporting documentation or evidence are first reviewed by the HR Director.

Disciplinary Action Procedure:
a.

Predisciplinary Conference. Before imposing discipline, a predisciplinary
conference shall be conducted for the purpose of informing the Employee of the
basis of the charges and giving the Employee an opportunity to explain or refute the
charges. Except as otherwise directed by the Department Head, the Employee’s
direct Supervisor may conduct the predisciplinary conference and impose discipline
if the maximum disciplinary action to be taken is a verbal or written reprimand. In
all other cases, the recommendations of the Employee’s direct Supervisor shall be
solicited and shall receive serious consideration by the Department Head or his/her
designee who shall conduct the predisciplinary conference and determine the level
of discipline to be imposed. In more serious matters, the COO or his/her designee
may conduct the predisciplinary conference.

b.

Notice. The Department Head or his/her designee or the Supervisor shall serve
proper notice of the predisciplinary conference upon the Employee either by
providing a letter to the Employee or mailing the letter to the Employee. The notice
shall set forth the date, time and place of the predisciplinary conference and shall
indicate the nature of the alleged infractions and the possible disciplinary action that
may be imposed should the charges be sustained.

c.

Representation. Employees shall be entitled to bring a representative to the
predisciplinary conference, provided that, given the informal nature of the
predisciplinary conference, the representative shall not be an attorney. If the
Employee is represented by a union, that union shall have the exclusive right of
representation unless the Employee expresses a desire for other representation in
writing. Union members are entitled to representation by duly elected or appointed
union representatives, but may not insist upon representation by a specific union
official or steward. Health System managers, Supervisors and members of the
Human Resources/Labor Relations staff may not serve as representatives. The right
to limit the number of representatives or participants at a predisciplinary conference
is reserved to the individual conducting the predisciplinary conference.
Written Response. At the end of the predisciplinary conference, the Employee may
request to submit a written statement within five calendar days after the
predisciplinary conference. With the exception of circumstances in which the
Employee is already on emergency suspension, if the Employee makes such a
request, the individual who is conducting the predisciplinary hearing shall review the
Employee’s written response prior to imposing the disciplinary action.

d.

46

 67
Draft 07-08-09

e.

Disciplinary Action Form. Disciplinary Action shall be issued in writing on a
Disciplinary Action Form. Generally, the Disciplinary Action Form shall be given
to the Employee at the end of, or within a reasonable period of time after, a
predisciplinary conference or, if the Employee has requested to file a written
statement, within five calendar days after the written statement is submitted or is due
to be submitted. A letter prepared and given to the Employee that contains all of the
information required to be included in the Disciplinary Action Form can be used in
lieu of the Disciplinary Action Form.
1.

2.

f.

The Disciplinary Action Form shall include the following:
(a)

A statement of the charges and the basis therefor and any relevant
previous disciplinary action.

(b)

Unless the disciplinary action is for discharge, a statement that
committing the same, similar, or other infraction will result in further
disciplinary action up to and including discharge.

(c)

The Disciplinary Action Form shall include the signature of the direct
Supervisor, the COO or his/her Designee and the Employee. If the
Employee refuses to sign the form, the refusal is noted in the space
designated for the Employee's signature.

Copies of the Disciplinary Action Form are distributed as follows:
(a)

The Employee.

(b)

The Employee’s Department Head.

(c)

The Affiliate HR Office, for inclusion in the Employee’s HR file.

(d)

HR Director.

(e)

Consideration of Prior Discipline
1.

Oral Reprimand: An oral reprimand will be disregarded if after twelve
months there has been no further disciplinary action.

2.

Written Reprimand: A written reprimand will be disregarded after twelve
months if there has been no further disciplinary action.

47

 68
Draft 07-08-09

3.

8.06

Suspension: The fact that a suspension has been imposed previously may be
considered in a subsequent disciplinary matter.

Discharge
Discharge is invoked for just cause, which is defined as repetition of the same or similar
infractions, or a combination of infractions of the Rules of Conduct for which there has been
progressive disciplinary action, or commission of an infraction considered “Major Cause” as
defined previously. An Employee who has been previously suspended may be subject to
discharge for the next offense.

8.07

Emergency Suspension
An emergency suspension may be given prior to any step of disciplinary action when it is
believed by the Department Head or his/her Designee that the presence of the Employee will
pose a danger or will result in the disruption of operations or when major cause is alleged
and time is needed to conduct an investigation. Department Heads must report all
emergency suspensions to the HR Director and the COO of the applicable Affiliate. In no
case shall an emergency suspension exceed ten (10) working days without the prior written
approval of the HR Director.

8.08

Time Limits
Departments should convene a predisciplinary conference and impose disciplinary action
promptly. Generally, the predisciplinary conference shall be convened within thirty (30)
days of the time the alleged infraction occurred or became known to the Department. This
time frame shall not be strictly applied and may be extended if the Employee or the
Employee’s representative is granted a delay of the predisciplinary conference or if the
prediscipinary conference or its completion is delayed for reasonable cause. Should an
Employee fail to appear at a predisciplinary conference after proper notice without a
showing of good cause, that Employee shall forfeit any right to appeal any disciplinary
action imposed.

8.09

Appeals from Disciplinary Action
An Employee may appeal from disciplinary action by filing a grievance as provided in Rule
9, Grievances.

RULE 9
GRIEVANCES
9.01 Scope
This Rule 9, Grievance, applies to Career Service Employees and does not apply to any
Exempt Employee.
9.02 Definition
A grievance is a difference between an Employee and the System or the County with respect
to the interpretation or application of, or compliance with, these Rules, regulations, policies,
disciplinary action or the terms in an applicable collective bargaining agreement.
"Grievance," as defined herein, shall not include disputes over salary scales or wage rates.
9.03

Policy
a.

The County is committed to fair employment practices and recognizes its
responsibility to review and make a reasonable effort to resolve Employees'
grievances. All eligible Employees have a right to file a grievance and shall be
assured freedom from coercion, restraint, or reprisal. The term "Employee" as used
throughout this procedure shall also be understood to include any collective
bargaining representative, unless otherwise stated.

b.

An Employee is encouraged first to discuss the problem/dispute with the direct
Supervisor. This is referred to as step one of the grievance process.

c.

If the Employee feels the problem/dispute has not been satisfactorily resolved as a
result of this discussion with the direct Supervisor, the Employee may advance
review in accordance with Section 9.05, Grievance Procedure.

d.

Grievances of a general nature or affecting more than one (1) Employee may be
presented by collective bargaining representatives to the Affiliate COO or his/her
designee. This is referred to as Step 2 in the grievance process.

e.

For grievances not related to the Employee's Affiliate, the grievance should be filed
with the HR Director for response or forwarding as appropriate.

Employees are entitled to a representative of their own choosing at any of the
applicable steps of the grievance process, except that managers, Supervisors or
Human Resources/Labor Relations staff may not serve as representatives.

the time period shall be five (5) days from the date of receipt by the Employee of the
Disciplinary Action Form.

b.

An Employee's failure to file a grievance within the time period specified shall
constitute a waiver of any rights to advance the grievance. Failure to appear for a
hearing after proper notice at any step of the grievance process shall constitute a
waiver of rights to further advance a grievance.

Grievance Procedure
a.

Prior to initiating a grievance, the Employee must obtain a Grievance Form from the
Affiliate's Human Resources office and must complete the form indicating the nature
of the grievance and the resolution sought. The Affiliate Human Resources office
shall assign a grievance reference number and retain a copy of the completed
Grievance Form and shall keep a log of all grievances filed. Upon receiving a
grievance reference number from the Affiliate Human Resources office, the
Employee may advance the grievance.
1.

Step One: The Employee advances the grievance as follows:
(a)

The Employee represents the Grievance Form to the direct
Supervisor.

(b)

Within five (5) calendar days after receipt, the direct Supervisor shall
meet with the Employee to discuss the grievance. This time period
for holding a meeting may be extended if, during the five (5) day
period, the parties attempt to schedule a meeting date but are unable

Within five (5) calendar days of the meeting, the direct Supervisor
shall provide a response to the Employee which shall be recorded on
the Grievance Form and shall provide a copy of the response to the
Affiliate Human Resources Office.

If the response is not satisfactory, the Employee may, within five (5)
calendar days after receipt of the Step 1 response, or if no response is
provided, within five (5) calendar days after the periods for meeting
and responding to the grievance in writing have expired, advance the
grievance to Step 2.

(f)

Failure to advance the grievance within five (5) calendar days after
receipt of the Step 1 response or within five (5) calendar days after
the Step 1 response is due, concludes the grievance procedure.

Step Two: The Employee advances the grievance to Step 2 as follows:

Resolution 
 
To Restore Local Health Protection Grant Funds 
for Illinois County Health Departments 
 
  
WHEREAS, The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has eliminated funding 
for Local Health Protection Grants in their FY 2010 proposed budget; and, 
 
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health receives approximately $2 
million annually from this grant to fund its core mandated public health programs; 
namely,  investigation  and  control  of  communicable  diseases,  including  sexually 
transmitted  diseases,  and  the  administration  of  immunizations  and  environmental 
health  regulatory  programs  including  but  not  limited  to  retail  food  sanitation 
inspections,  swimming  pool  inspections,  and  the  regulation  of  private  sewage 
disposal systems; and,   
 
WHEREAS, the termination of the Local Health Protection Grant will adversely, and 
potentially  irreparably,  diminish  the  capacity  of  the  Cook  County  Department  of 
Public  Health  to  perform  these  critical  functions  and  to  respond  to  public  health 
emergencies; and,  
 
WHEREAS,  the  termination  of  the  Local  Health  Protection  Grant  will  further 
adversely  affect  the  ability  of  the  Cook  County  Department  of  Public  Health  to 
respond  to  the  Influenza  Type  A  H1N1  pandemic  making  the  timing  of  the 
elimination of the grant particularly unwise; and, 
 
WHEREAS, it is the belief that the elimination of the Local Health Protection Grant is 
very shortsighted and it will likely result in great hardship,  expense, and threat to 
life and health as a result of the inability to perform these core functions as powers 
and duties delegated to certified local health departments by the Illinois Department 
of Public Health. 
 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  BE  IT  RESOLVED  that  the  Cook  County  Health  &  Hospitals 
System Board requests the Illinois General Assembly and Governor Patrick Quinn to 
immediately restore funding for the Local Health Protection Grant in the proposed 
FY  2010  IDPH  budget  and  that  the  Cook  County  Department  of  Public  Health 
forward a copy of this resolution to each member of the Illinois General Assembly 
representing citizens of Cook County and to Governor Quinn for their consideration.
