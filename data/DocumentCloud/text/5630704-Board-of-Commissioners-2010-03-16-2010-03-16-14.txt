EXPLANATION
The CHA plans to open the General Family Public Housing Wait List in FY2010. The CHA
plans on utilizing a vendor to create and implement an online portal that will accept applications
electronically during the period of the opening of the General Family Wait List, as well as be
responsible for hosting the portal website during the period in which open enrollment is active
and until all applications are processed. The website will consist of an online application entry

 form with field and form validation. Once the open enrollment has closed and all online and
paper applications have been processed, the website will need to output the applicant data into a
predetermined standard file format for import to the CHA’s property management and resident
tracking system, Yardi.
Model Metrics proposes to utilize licenses and technology that the CHA already uses. They
demonstrated that they are able to create a quick interactive website that is scalable and can meet
the high traffic demands of this project. Their reporting capabilities, rapid development
implementation of the initial online website and the online applicant portal, and awareness of
potential risks and solutions are desirable for this project. In addition to their technical expertise,
Model Metrics proposed the lowest price of six vendor proposals submitted to the CHA.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY
On January 27, 2010, the CHA advertised a Request for Proposal (RFP), No. 09-00475. The
bidding period was open to interested vendors for a period of 21 days. The RFP was advertised
in the Chicago SunTimes, Chicago Defender, and El Dia newspapers, as well as through
notifications posted on the CHA website and in BuySpeed. In addition, notification was sent to
44 Assist Agencies for provision to their member list. A pre-proposal conference was held at the
CHA on February 8, 2010, at which a discussion of the requirements and scope of services was
held. Six (6) proposals were received on February 22, 2010, and were evaluated and scored by a
designated team of CHA employees. Of the six (6) respondents, three (3) of the scored proposals
were found to be within the competitive range set and approved by the Contracting Officer.
Individual discussions and clarifications meetings (oral presentations) were conducted with the
three (3) vendors on March 3, 2010. Best and Final Offers (BAFO) were requested and received
on March 4, 2010. After review of the BAFO submitted by the three (3) Respondents, it was
determined that Model Metrics, Inc. best exhibited the knowledge and expertise to provide the
CHA with the requested services at the most competitive price.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA that the Board of Commissioners
authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a service agreement with
Model Metrics for online applicant system services for a twelve (12) month period in a firm,
fixed amount of $103,868.00.
