and treatment services for the period 6/24/2019 – 12/31/2019.
Funding Source: General Fund – Jail Medical
Tanisha Gates and Stephen Witt, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Lenora Lockett commented that the
vendor has not completed the registration process with the Office of the Inspector General and asked if
the vendor could be registered under a different name or if this service would qualify as physician services
and be exempt from registration. Mr. Witt stated that the vendor is currently registered under the name
of Kurt Zillmann.
Trevor McAleer asked if Alternative Body Connections, LLC is the current provider and how many inmates,
on average, are receiving therapy; asked if services are being provided at the downtown Jail and who
issues the orders for therapy services; and asked if there is a current contract in place and if so, when will
it expire.
Ms. Gates indicated there is no current contract.
Mr. McAleer asked how this vendor has been providing services with no contract and whether services
were ever bid out; asked if this vendor was ever selected through a competitive bid process and requested
additional information on how this vendor was selected prior to this contract; asked for a total paid to
this vendor to date; and asked if there is a termination clause in this contract in case MetroHealth can
begin providing these services prior to this contract’s expiration.
Dennis Kennedy asked if services were being paid on office vouchers in the past and asked for
confirmation that those amounts billed were generally less than $1,000; asked if the amount of this
contract will be for new services only and not for services already provided; and asked if the last office
voucher paid would have occurred within the past 30 days.
Nan Baker asked if services will be added to the new contract that is being negotiated with MetroHealth
and if the new contract is expected to be finalized before the end of the year; asked why will it take 6
months to negotiate this service with MetroHealth, where this contract would not otherwise be
necessary; and asked for clarification on whether the past practice of paying by invoice was an option.
Mr. Kennedy indicated that paying by invoice is not an option because funds must be encumbered for
tracking allocations and for audit purposes.
Mr. McAleer addressed Ms. Baker’s question as to whether this service would be part of the MetroHealth
contract and stated that he does not recall a line item for physical therapy services in the contract so this
may result in an additional expense outside of the contract.
Mr. Kennedy stated that additional information regarding this request will be distributed to the Board
members.
Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-484 was
unanimously approved.

 C. – Consent Agenda
Trevor McAleer referred to Item BC2019-485 and asked what the average life span of a crane is and how
much did the County pay for the equipment. Dennis Kennedy asked what the current value of the crane
is. Dale Miller asked if the department could have anticipated, prior to the purchase, that the crane usage
would not last beyond 3 years, after it no longer fit with the department’s strategy.
Nan Baker referred to Item BC2019-486 and asked for clarification on the subgrant agreement end date;
asked why the payment was not made earlier and how much money has been held that is to be paid;
asked if there is any need to extend the time period of the agreement; and asked for clarification on the
amount owed. Dennis Kennedy asked what the dates of the invoices are and why did it take one year to
bring this request forward to get the invoices paid.
Trevor McAleer referred to Item BC2019-489 – Direct Open Market Purchases on various requisitions for
food purchases for the Sheriff’s Department and stated that the proposals for food service are currently
being scored for a new contract and that this may perhaps, be the last food order utilizing this process for
the Jail, which is a positive step in the management of the Jail.
There were no further questions on the consent agenda items. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve
items BC2019-485 through -489; Michael Dever seconded, the consent agenda items were unanimously

Item No. 3
The Cuyahoga County Corrections Planning Board was awarded a $2,000,000 grant from the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) ($400,000 per year for 5 years) to support a
Cuyahoga County MAT Drug Court expansion project. The project is a multi-dimensional, proactive
approach that will fight against the current opiate crises in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Specifically, the project
will allow the current Drug Court expand its comprehensive system of supports and services that help
individuals to move toward recovery while assisting them in making productive and positive life changes.
The project will begin in 05/31/2019 and end in 05/30/2024. The project has not started at this time.
The Drug Court will be facilitated by the Honorable Judge David Matia, who has received numerous awards
for his work with opioid addicts in the criminal justice system. Under his leadership the Drug Court will
annually serve an additional 50 unduplicated clients (or 250 unduplicated clients over the five-year life of
the grant period) with an Opioid Use Disorder to further bridge the gap between treatment and long-term
sobriety. The Drug Court will not only provide opioid-dependent offenders with judicial supervision,
intensive case management involving Treatment Alternative to Street Crime (TASC) counselors and
Probation Officers, program sanctions and rewards, and residential and outpatient treatment—but offer
additional resources that include the availability of Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) and the
opportunity to extend their recovery by living in halfway houses or sober living accommodations. Hence,
the goals and objectives of the Drug Court address three critical areas. First, the court will assist clients
with a team-supported treatment experience that is culturally competent, evidence-based, age and
gender appropriate and combines behavioral health treatment and substance use disorder (SUD)
treatment with monitored MAT pharmaceuticals. Second, it will increase the length of time clients achieve
sustained recovery from opiates through halfway house and sober living housing stays and specialized
case management. Third, it will demonstrate the effectiveness of its supports and services through the
evaluation of meaningful data addressing programmatic effectiveness.
In addition to achieving ongoing sobriety, improved criminal justice outcomes and access to HIV/Hepatitis
B & C screenings and referrals, the expanded Drug Court will allow clients to obtain stability in the areas
of health, education, employment, housing, and family relations. A collaboration of community partners
is committed to providing the most effective treatment services for Drug Court clients that support their
recovery process. They include Community Assessment & Treatment Services (CATS), Catholic Charities
(Matt Talbot), the Stella Maris, Inc., and the Salvation Army/Harbor Light Complex.

 Item No. 4
The Cuyahoga County Corrections Planning Board was awarded a $40,000 grant from the Ohio
Department of Public Safety (which includes a match of $13,331.95) to support a Coordinator position to
oversee implementation of its new Violence Intervention Program (VIP) Pilot or “VIP Court” that addresses
gun violence in Cuyahoga County. The VIP Court will be implemented from January 1, 2019 until December
31, 2019. Approximately 15 individuals arrested for non-violent gun possession offenses will have the
opportunity to participate in the VIP Court for the 12-month period.
The VIP Court will provide a collaborative, multidisciplinary, problem-solving approach that addresses the
underlying issues of non-violent adult offenders involved in gun crimes. Its premise is that offenders can
change their lives for the better if they voluntarily become involved in a court intervention process that
includes six essential features. They include regular court appearances in front of a VIP Judge, the
supervision of a specialized VIP Probation Officer, the coordination of efforts between the County
Prosecutor and Public Defender, the support of a neighborhood outreach mentoring, opportunities for
substance abuse and mental health services (if needed), and the encouragement to secure employment
training and opportunities.
Through a process of sustained and consistent intervention, the VIP Court will become more involved in
gun-related cases that present the best opportunity for preventing future gun violence in Cuyahoga
County. Its goal is to reduce gun violence by comprehensively influencing individual behavior while
protecting the public and promoting community safety. Only by providing persons involved in gun violence
with hope and self-worth can they be encouraged to move away from a life of violence, which in turn
creates better communities.
With the support of a VIP Coordinator, a VIP Team will be responsible for implementing the daily
operations of the VIP Court. The team includes the following Cuyahoga County representatives: Court of
Common Pleas “VIP Judge,” Prosecutor, Public Defender, Probation Department, Corrections Planning
Board, Sheriff, and community-based service providers including Ohio Means Jobs/Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County (employment) and Cleveland Peacemakers Alliance (mentoring). The VIP Coordinator will provide
programmatic support to maintain its day-to-day operations and to address the needs of the VIP Court
and its participants.
