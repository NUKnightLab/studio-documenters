Chairman Einheuser stated the Board would move the public comment portion to the
end of the agenda after the drainage presentation. He suggested comments and/or
questions be addressed during the meeting, and those matters that require more
investigation would be addressed in a timely manner. Director Brown replied that staff
was on-hand to accommodate this process. Chairman Einheuser also suggested
public comment speaking is limited from three to two minutes to allow all constituents
an opportunity to voice their concerns. Commissioner Blackmon stated that Board
meetings are recorded and notice of the meetings are publicized on the City's website.
Commissioner Blackmon had reservations about the evening meetings scheduled time
and suggested rescheduling from 6 to 7:30 p.m. to 6-8 pm., which is the normal
(two-hour) time allotted for the Board's regular monthly meetings.
