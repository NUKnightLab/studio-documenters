 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 17, 2009
SALUTING THE CAREER AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF DR. CLYDE COLLINS SNOW
WHEREAS, Clyde Collins Snow, Ph.D., received an Associate of Arts Degree from New Mexico
Military Institute in 1947, a Bachelor of Science Degree from Eastern New Mexico University in 1951, a
Master of Science Degree from Texas Technical University in 1955, a Doctor of Philosophy from
University of Arizona in 1967 and Doctor of Science (Hon) from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in
1993; and
WHEREAS, in 1979, Dr. Snow retired from the Federal Aviation Administration to serve as an
independent consultant in forensic anthropology; during his FAA career, he conducted research on human
factor problems in aviation safety and participated in the investigation of general and commercial aviation
accidents; in addition, he has lectured extensively to law enforcement, university and forensic science
groups on his specialty of human skeletal identification; he has acted as the Forensic Anthropology
Consultant to the Cook County Medical Examiner since 1979; and
WHEREAS, during his career, Dr. Snow has served as a consultant in nearly 3000 cases involving the
identification and determination of the cause of death of skeletonized victims; his cases include the 1979
American Airlines DC-10 crash, the John Wayne Gacy serial murders, and the Green River murders; in
1985, at the request of the Simon Weisenthal Institute, he headed a team of U. S. forensic scientists that
went to Brazil to aid in the identification of the skeleton of the notorious Nazi war criminal, Dr. Josef
Mengele; and
WHEREAS, in 1984, Dr. Snow went to Argentina to serve as a consultant to that nation’s National
Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP). The CONADEP mission was to determine
the fate of thousands of Argentineans who were abducted, tortured and murdered by the military “Death
Squads” between 1976 and 1983 when the country was under the rule of a military dictatorship; in 1985,
he testified as a prosecution expert in the trial of the nine generals and admirals who ruled Argentina
during the period of military repression; his testimony was the first instance in which forensic scientific
evidence was used in a human rights trial; six of the nine defendants were convicted; since then, he has
performed similar missions in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, El Salvador, Ethiopia,
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Venezuela, Iraqi Kurdistan,
Democratic Republic of Congo (former Zaire) and Zimbabwe; and
WHEREAS, over the years Dr. Snow has founded and trained forensic anthropology teams in Argentina,
Chili, Guatemala and Peru; these teams not only conduct human rights investigations in their own
countries but have been called to aid in such investigations throughout the world (34 countries, so far); in
2002, he helped found the Latin American Association of Forensic Anthropologists and serves as its
Honorary President; in June 2004, in recognition of his work in the investigations of the Disappeared, he
was invited to return to Argentina as a guest of honor of the City of Buenos Aires where he was honored
with a medal and diploma making him an honorary citizen; and
WHEREAS, in 1992, Dr. Snow served in Geneva as a U. S. Delegate to the United Nations Human
Rights Commission; he has also completed several UN-sponsored missions to Former Yugoslavia to
collect forensic evidence to be used in war crimes trials by the UN War Crimes Tribunal; in March 1998,
he testified as an expert witness at the Tribunal in the trial of the Serb defendant charged with the
extrajudicial execution of nearly 200 unarmed Croatian hospital patients whose remains Dr. Snow found
in a mass grave near Vukovar, Croatia in October 1992; this was significant because the Vukovar grave
was the first forensically documented incident of “ethnic cleansing” in Former Yugoslavia, and Dr.
Snow’s testimony was the first given by a forensic expert witness before a UN War Crimes Tribunal; in
Baghdad in November 2006, Dr. Snow testified as an expert in the trial of Saddam Hussein and his codefendants for their genocidal campaign against the Iraqi Kurds; and

925

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 17, 2009
WHEREAS, in his role of Forensic Anthropology Consultant to the Cook County Office of the Medical
Examiner, Dr. Snow has helped train staff Forensic Pathologists, residents in Forensic Pathology training
at the Office as well as countless medical students and visiting residents and physicians in forensic
anthropology by didactic lecture and hands-on teaching.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, on behalf of the more than five
million residents of Cook County, do hereby express deep appreciation for the dedication and leadership
exemplified by Dr. Clyde Collins Snow in his capacity as Forensic Anthropology Consultant to Cook
County and in his long, distinguished and multifaceted career, and may a copy of this Resolution be
tendered to Dr. Clyde Collins Snow herewith.
Approved and adopted this 17th day of March 2009.

an extended period of time of at least twenty-four months; and

c.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to,
an economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook

its operations so that the commercial enterprise can continue to occupy and fully
utilize the real estate for an extended period of time.

Such a Resolution or Ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that
Class 8a designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing commercial

Class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this section, the municipality in which
the real estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a Resolution or
Ordinance that contains the following:

be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Upon receipt of a completed eligibility application and all required municipal and county
Ordinances and Resolutions, including those referenced in this section, the property will
qualify for the Class 8a designation provided the Cook County Assessor determines that
the real estate which is the subject of the application for a Class 8a designation would
qualify for designation as a Class 8 property but for the inability to comply with the
definition of abandonment pursuant to Sec. 74-62(b). If the Cook County Assessor makes
such a determination the property shall be classified as a Class 8a property pursuant to
this section.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Health & Hospitals of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to
notice on Thursday, March 5, 2009 at the hour of 2:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
298604

IN OPPOSITION TO THE RELOCATION OF THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT
OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO THE OAK FOREST HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY
CAMPUS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored
by Peter N. Silvestri and Earlean Collins, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
IN OPPOSITION TO THE RELOCATION OF THE
COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
TO THE OAK FOREST HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY CAMPUS
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health has been located at its
current location at 1010 Lake Street in Oak Park, Illinois since 1992, having relocated
from its Maybrook County Courthouse facility for the purpose of providing additional
courtrooms; and
WHEREAS, the facility is centrally located in Cook County in downtown Oak Park,
accessible to the CTA Green Line and the Blue Line, the METRA railroad line and the
Eisenhower Expressway and numerous PACE and CTA bus lines; and

1008

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 17, 2009
WHEREAS, the facility includes the Department’s administration offices, various
educational programs, and public information resources, which are utilized by
municipalities, public and private schools, community groups, the press and the public;
and
WHEREAS, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County is located in the far southwest section
of the County and is not nearly as accessible as the Oak Park location; and
WHEREAS, the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County site requires the expenditure of
public funds, which far outweigh a long term rental of space in a central location; and
WHEREAS, the people of Cook County and their municipalities and schools are better
served in an accessible, central location, which has been utilized as such for the past
seventeen years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of
Commissioners direct that all efforts and expenditures planned for the relocation of the
Cook County Department of Public Health be terminated.
*Referred to the Committee on Health & Hospitals on 02/04/09.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved approval of Communication
No. 298604.
Commissioner Schneider inquired as to what the cost would be to relocate the Cook County Department
of Public Health to Oak Forest and how many years of leases it would take to recoup those dollars to
build out what needs to be done at Oak Forest.
Bruce Washington, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, stated that in regards to relocation
cost and the renovation cost, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has projected a cost of $5.1
million. In reference to the lease cost currently the County is spending $601,000.00 annually, plus
$50,000.00 for operating costs per year. Mr. Washington stated that the costs are recouped within a
number of years.
Commissioner Schneider inquired as to how much time is left on the lease that currently exists on the
building which the Cook County Department of Public Health currently occupies.
Mr. Washington responded that the lease expires April 2011.
Commissioner Schneider asked if there was a termination clause in the lease.
Stephen A. Martin, Jr., Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Operating Officer, Department of Public Health, stated that
when the lease originally came up the Department of Public Health negotiated with the landlord and let
them know what the Department of Public Health’s plans were and agreed to a three (3) year time period
in terms of the capital build out. The lease was structured in such a way that it only gives the Department
of Public Health time for the renovation to build out and it also took into account that if the renovations
went as quickly as they could predict (probably 2010) the Department of Public Health could get out of
the lease as early as 2010.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Dr. Martin conduct a survey of Department of Public Health
employees regarding the relocation.

1009

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 17, 2009
Dr. Martin stated that he will perform a survey and get back to the Committee.
