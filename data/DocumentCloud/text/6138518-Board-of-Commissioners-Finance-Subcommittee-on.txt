PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Keith R. Sbrial, AICP, Village Manager, Village of Brookfield
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of Brookfield
Volume and Property Index Number:
075, 18-03-214-030-0000.
Summary:
The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the “Village”) hereby requests no-cash bid acquisition
of the following parcel. This Request Package contains one (1) PIN referred to herein as the “Property.”
The Property is located at 8834 Ogden Avenue in the Village of Brookfield. The Property is improved
with a single-story commercial structure used as part of a retail facility selling custom countertops
operating as the Marble Place. The Village seeks to acquire and hold the Property for redevelopment
pending a future proposal by a yet-to-be-determined developer for commercial use of the Property.
Acquisition of the Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program will benefit the Village by
potential redevelopment of a commercial, tax-generating use of Property. Commercial development of
the Property will benefit the Village by increasing the Village’s property and sales tax base and by
offering additional employment opportunities to local residents.

If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for
tax exempt status and will maintain the Property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third
party for redevelopment. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a
developer, organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of a
certificate of purchase for, or perfected tax deed to, the Property to such a developer, organization, or
private party.
The Village will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel. The Village
agrees to submit an annual report on the status of this parcel for five (5) years or until development is
complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid Ordinance.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: John F. Donahue, Village Attorney, Village of Glenwood
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of Glenwood
Volume and Property Index Number:
009, 32-03-318-002-0000; 009, 32-03-318-003-0000; 009, 32-03-318-004-0000.
Summary: Please accept this letter as the Village of Glenwood’s application to participate in the Cook
County No Cash Bid Program for the 2017 County Scavenger Sale for the parcels of property identified.
In the event these parcels are not eligible for the No Cash Bid Program, the Village is alternatively
requesting that an Over-The-Counter tax certificate be issued and assigned to the Village of Glenwood.

restaurant that has been closed for three (3) years. At the time the property was abandoned, the Village
attempted to work with the business occupying the parcels to see if it could utilize available TIF
incentives to improve the structure so that the restaurant can continue to operate. Ultimately, the Village
concluded that the costs of rehabilitating this structure so that it could continue to be useable as a
restaurant was far more than the value of the entire site. The structure on this property has continued to
deteriorate and the Village believes that it is now in a dangerous condition. It is the Village of
Glenwood’s desire to obtain title to this property so that it can demolish the hazardous structure located
on this property so that the property can be redeveloped by a private entity, returned to the property tax
rolls and create additional employment opportunities within the Village. This parcel is in the Village of
Glenwood’s Main Street Tax Increment Financing District. Accordingly, TIF incentives as allowed by
the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act would be available to incentivize the acquisition and
redevelopment of this parcel by a private entity.
In the event this application is approved, it is the Village’s intent to file the necessary documents that are
required to obtain a tax-exempt status for the property. The Village will continue to maintain this tax
exempt status for the property as long as the Village continues to own it.
Please be advised that the
Village does not have any agreement to convey the perfected tax deed for the property to any developer,
organization or other private party. The Village also has not entered into any negotiations with any
developer, organization, or other entity pertaining to this property. The Village’s is not acting on behalf
of any third party requestor.
In the event this application is approved, the Village has by resolution authorized me to proceed to

agrees that it will need to comply with the reporting requirements of the County’s No Cash Bid
Ordinance. This will require the Village to submit No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook
County’s No Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of
eighty-nine (89) Parcels of vacant land listed in our request and they are as follows. The City’s request
will be indicated in our Resolution to be introduced at the April 10, 2017 Council meeting. The City of
Harvey requests eighty-nine (89) parcels of vacant land for the redevelopment of our major
thoroughfares and Downtown Business District areas.

The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. There is no Third Party Requestors
statement. The City of Harvey will file for tax exempt status for each parcel granted in our request. The
City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually on each parcel
for five (5) years or until the development is completed, whichever occurs last. If a City of Harvey lien is
cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the
City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate
the lien after the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

Summary: Please accept this letter as the Village of Hazel Crest’s application to participate in the Cook
County No Cash Bid Program for the 2017 County Scavenger Sale for the parcels identified. This
Request Package contains four (4) PINs. The PINs are all being used as parking lots and have no
structures on the property. The first three (3) PINs for a fast food restaurant and the last PIN for a
specialty grocery store. It is the Village’s desire to obtain title to these properties through the County’s
No Cash Bid Program so that the property can be redeveloped for commercial purposes or transferred to
a private entity for redevelopment as commercial property, returned to the tax rolls and create additional
employment opportunities within the Village.

In the event this application is approved, it is the Village’s intent to file the necessary documents
required to obtain tax-exempt status for the parcels. The Village will continue to maintain tax-exempt
status for the parcels as long as the Village continues to own the parcels. Please be advised that the
Village does not have any agreements to convey the perfected tax deeds for the parcels to any developer,
organization or other private party pertaining to these parcels. The Village is not acting on behalf of any
third party requestor.
In the event this application is approved, the Village will retain legal counsel in order to obtain the tax
deeds. It will be the Village’s responsibility to bear all legal and other costs that are necessary for its
acquisition of the parcels through the tax deed process. The Village understands and agrees that it will
need to comply with the reporting requirements of the County’s No Cash Bid Ordinance. This will
require the Village to submit No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcels for the later of either five
(5) years or the completion of the development of the parcels.

Summary: Please find included in these materials the Village of South Chicago Heights’s no-cash bid
application. The Village submits this application in order to acquire property commonly known as 3244
Butler St., South Chicago Heights, IL 60411. There is only one PIN included in this request. This
property was previously used for industrial purposes as the site of the Chicago Heights Pattern & Model
Works, Inc., which employed up to twenty people. Unfortunately, this business no longer occupies the
building, and it has been vacant and unoccupied since 2010.

The Village has retained legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and will bear all legal and other costs
associated with the acquisition of this parcel. If the Village is able to acquire this property, it plans to
rehab the property and market it to an investor in the hopes of bringing jobs and money into the
community. However, there is no investor or third party to whom the Village presently plans to deed the
property, and there has been no third-party request made to the Village to acquire the property. If the
Village is unable to sell the property, then it will use it as the home of its Public Works Department.
If the Village successfully acquires this property, it will file for tax-exempt status because it will retain
the PIN for municipal use. It will also submit to the Cook County Planning and Development
Department no-cash bid reports on the status of the parcel for five years or until development is
