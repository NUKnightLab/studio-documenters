other mental health service agencies, such as The MetroHealth System and The Alcohol, Drug Addiction

Shari Weir, Office of Homeless Services, presented. Dennis Kennedy asked for clarification on the contract
end date and whether the current contract had expired.
Nan Baker asked if it is legally acceptable to amend an expired contract.
Mr. Kennedy commented that there are distinctions between extending and amending a contract and
getting a new contract and asked for comment from Lenora Lockett.

 Lenora Lockett stated that the Board has voted on prior contracts that were late, which in her opinion as
the Director of the Office of Procurement and Diversity, were expired contracts.
Ms. Baker asked Ms. Lockett if there is a distinction between a contract that has been initiated where the
funding is requested after the start date and an amendment on a contract that has lapsed; asked for
confirmation that approvals of this type have been done before.
Ms. Lockett stated that is her recall.
Mr. Kennedy commented that this appears to be a contract that was overlooked and in order to keep the
process moving, an amendment was submitted rather than initiating a new contract.
Jerad Zibritosky, Department of Law, stated that it is legal to amend an expired contract to add time
and/or additional funding, provided it is acceptable to both contracting parties and said that it is not under
his purview, as to whether it is considered best practice and deferred to Ms. Lockett.
Ms. Lockett stated that in general, the departments and the providers have the authority that has been
approved by the pertinent contracting authority and that any contract presented outside of those terms
is up to that contracting authority to determine if they wish to approve and grant that authority; said
that the preference is to always approve contracts and amendments in advance of the start date with
permission from the contracting authority; and stated that the Board has approved contracts that have
expired and amendments that are past the date of the original amendment.
Ms. Baker acknowledged the importance of this service; asked how would the provider have been paid
for services provided since July, if this amendment had not been approved; asked if the provider
understood the risk of providing services without an approved contract; asked if the department is now
in the process of preparing for the next contract once this contract has expired; and asked if any funds
have been paid since the date of expiration.
Mr. Kennedy stressed the need for a process to monitor contract expiration dates so that contracts may
be submitted in a timely manner.
Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-719 was
unanimously approved.
BC2019-720
Department of Health and Human Services/Division of Senior and Adult Services, requesting authority to
submit a grant application to the Western Reserve Area Agency on Aging in the amount of $409,640.42
for the Older Americans Act/Senior Community Services Program in connection with the Aging and
Disability Resource Network Grant Program for the period 1/1/2020 – 12/31/2021.
Funding Source: The project requires a 15% funding match from the Cuyahoga County Health and
Human Services Levy. The grant funds are federal OAA Title III E funds
Paul Porter, Division of Senior and Adult Services, presented. Nan Baker asked how the total amount of
the match of 15% from the Health and Human Services Levy Fund is determined and asked if the actual
amount of funds received will be $409,640.62. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Nan Baker
