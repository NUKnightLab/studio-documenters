SORNA Reallocation Funds:

Background Information

 

SORNA Reallocation Funds: Background
Information
•

SORNA is Title I of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.

•

SORNA provides a comprehensive set of minimum standards for sex offender registration
and notification in the United States.

•

The Office of Justice Programs’ (OJP) Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending,
Registering, and Tracking (SMART) Office is responsible for:

•

•

Developing programs that are designed to implement SORNA.

•

Determining whether each state is in substantial compliance (currently, 18 states).

Illinois has not substantially implemented SORNA, and has never been considered to be in
substantial compliance.

 SORNA Reallocation Funds: Background
Information
•

SORNA penalty: a state that has not substantially implemented SORNA receives a 10
percent reduction to the funds that it would otherwise receive under its Byrne JAG
formula grant.

•

The reduction is applied to the JAG grant for the following fiscal year.

•

For funds withheld, SORNA provides reallocation:
•

“Amounts not allocated under [JAG] to a jurisdiction for failure to substantially
implement [SORNA] shall be reallocated under [JAG] to jurisdictions that have not
failed to substantially implement [SORNA] or may be reallocated to a jurisdiction
from which they were withheld to be used solely for the purpose of implementing
[SORNA].” See 42 U.S.C. § 16925(c) (emphasis added).

 SORNA Reallocation Funds: Background
Information
•

States that have been penalized and want the funds reallocated back to it must make a
written request to the SMART Office that must include a plan and timeline for substantial
compliance.

•

The decisions on those requests is made by the Assistant Attorney General for OJP.

•

As Illinois’ SAA, ICJIA is responsible for submitting that request, which it does in
collaboration with the Illinois State Police.

  

Illinois? Implementation of

SORNA

 

Illinois’ Implementation Issues
•

Legislative Matters:
•

SORNA requires a three-tier registration system; Illinois currently has a two-tier system

•

SORNA mandates a 15-year minimum registration; Illinois has a 10-year minimum

•

Registerable offenses that Illinois currently does not cover:

•

•

Conspiracy to commit any sex offense

•

Several federal offenses

Information that must be collected at the time of registration that Illinois does not
capture:
•

Digitized copies of passports

•

Digitized copies of immigration documents

•

Palm prints

 Illinois’ Implementation Issues
•

Non-legislative Matters:
•

All sex offenders must have a palm print on file, but not all Illinois law enforcement agencies and
prisons have Livescan and/or the necessary hardware and software.

•

Immediate transfer of information at the time of initial registration to other jurisdictions, the
national registry, and the registry website, which requires electronic means that not all
jurisdictions in Illinois have.

•

Website deficiencies:
•

The state’s registry website must capture multiple addresses, phone numbers, etc. for the
offender, but ISP uses LEADS, which is only able to capture one.

•

The registry website must contain criminal history, employer address, and other information
that Illinois does not currently do.

•

An active community notification system—Illinois does not have this technology in place.

•

Reallocated SORNA funds first became available in FFY ‘12.

•

SORNA funds from FFY ‘12, ‘13, and ‘14 were combined to support the first 4 agreements listed.

•

ICJIA has been told from the Federal monitor that SORNA funds may no longer be used to support
Offender Watch, as Offender Watch does not meet the standards established by SORNA and the
SMART Office.

  

Plan for FFY ?16 and ?17

Reallocated Funds

 

ICJIA’s Plan for FFY ‘16 and ‘17 Reallocated
Funds
• Potential uses are limited to things that would address Illinois’ non-legislative
implementation issues.
• FFY ‘16 funds: $214, 904 remain, which have been extended through 1/31/18.
• FFY ‘17 funds: $248,403.
• Budget Committee has approved issuing a NOFO using both FFY ‘16 and ‘17 funds
for awards to law enforcement agencies for the procurement of equipment to
facilitate the electronic submission of sex offender documents to ISP.
• Equipment would include scanners, computers, servers, Livescan and related
software/hardware, and related peripherals.

  

Looking Forward

 

Looking Forward
• ICJIA currently expects that FFY ’17 will be the last year that ICJIA expects to
receive reallocated SORNA funds.
• Legislation set to expire.
• Change in administration.
• Illinois unlikely to substantially implement SORNA.
