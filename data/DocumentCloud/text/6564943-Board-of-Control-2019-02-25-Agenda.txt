Additional Item
BC2019-139
Department of Law submitting an alternate procurement process, which will result in an award
recommendation to an electronic discovery vendor and related legal services in the amount not-to-exceed
$140,000.00 for temporary attorney services for the period 2/25/2019 - 2/24/2020.
Funding Source: General Fund
Nora Hurley and Jonathan McGory, Department of Law, presented. Trevor McAleer asked for clarification
on the not-to-exceed amount being requested and asked what amount will be requested when the
contract is submitted, if the lowest bid comes in below $140,000.00; Mr. McAleer made reference to
contracts discussed several months ago for outside legal counsel services and whether the proposed
contract would now be necessary and commented that maybe the County would not be faced with the
urgency to select a vendor in order to meet the imposed deadline, had those contracts moved forward
at that time.
Nan Baker asked if a request to extend the deadline to produce the records was considered. Michael
Dever suggested various options to expedite the approval of the contract to meet the subpoena deadline.
Lenora Lockett indicated this item could not be approved as a time sensitive/mission critical request, as
suggested by Mr. Dever, as it exceeds the $25,000.00 threshold; however, the selected vendor may be
given conditional authority to proceed if the vendor meets County requirements before the award is
made. Nan Baker asked if the Department of Law believed the deadline of March 1 could be met when
this vendor selection and approval process was being considered or would they seek a deadline extension;
asked if waiting an additional week for contract approval will still provide assurances that the services will
be complete and in compliance with the terms of the subpoena. Joseph Nanni asked if an IT solution is in
place to complete this process; asked if the County Prosecutor’s Office agrees with the approach to this
matter.
Trevor McAleer asked what the intended start date of the contract will be. Lenora Lockett said that the
contract outlining the amount, time period, scope of service will still need to come forward for the record
and formal Board approval, even if authority to issue a notice to proceed is granted, which would give
the vendor additional time to complete services. Trevor McAleer agreed with Ms. Lockett’s comments
and recommended that the contract date be set to begin at the end of this week and then bring the
contract forward for formal approval on February 25, 2019. Maggie Keenan motioned to amend the
28

 agenda to consider the item; Michael Dever seconded. Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item;
Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-139 was unanimously approved.

 C. – Exemptions
BC2019-148
Department of Development
Businesses either located in Cuyahoga County, or located elsewhere but employing Cuyahoga County
residents, may submit applications for reimbursement of employee training costs to the Department of
Development. A separate application will be submitted for each employee to be trained. Department of
Development staff will review each application and work with the business submitting the application as
needed to be sure the proposed training plan and training wage differential are consistent with Cuyahoga
County’s Learn and Earn program. Upon approval of each application, the Skill-Up Department Orders are
being processed by JFS Procurement. This will continue next year as well. A separate Department Order
will be issued for each employee to be trained. Each Department Order will be approved on the regular
weekly Board of Control calendar. Once the Department Order is approved by the Board of Control, the
business may begin training the employee. Generally, the business has begun the training program for
the employee; however, the County reimbursement will not take effect until approval is granted. As
the business pays out its approved training costs and training wage differential, it may submit monthly
invoices to the Department of Development with backup documentation as required by Learn and Earn
program guidelines. Department of Development staff will review each invoice and, upon approval,
submit the approved invoice for payment under the appropriate Department Order. The total amount
reimbursed for training of each employee will not exceed the amount of the Department Order
authorizing their training and training wage differential.
Because companies will be ready to request training approval on a rolling basis throughout the calendar
year, it is necessary to have a flexible approval process that complies with all legal requirements while
giving businesses certainty as to when their employee training applications will be approved.
The Law Department previously advised Development that an alternate process involving execution of a
single master contract, with repeated amendments to the contract adding new businesses, is under
development but is not yet available at this time, is under development but we are not yet considering
that option.
Companies will apply on a rolling basis and a separate Department Order(s) will be issued for each
company’s and each specific employee total amount of trainees. This will entail that we may have
several $25,000.00 Department Orders for the same company at the same time. However, the
Department Orders will be for different employees that are training within a single company. The
budgetary amount for the Skill-Up program does not change. This alternate procurement allows for the
Skill-Up program to pay for training in a timely manner also aligning within the Office of Procurement
and Diversity’s parameters.
