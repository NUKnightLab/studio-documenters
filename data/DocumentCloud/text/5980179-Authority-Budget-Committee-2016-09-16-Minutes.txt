Justice Assistance Grants
New Designations
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated September 16, 2016, on
FFY14 Justice Assistance Grant plan adjustments. He said that at the May 12, 2016,
Budget Committee meeting, the committee set aside $800,000 in FFY14 Justice
Assistance Grant (JAG) funds to support the Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent
Crime Notice of Funding Opportunity. The goal of the Illinois Partnerships to Reduce
Violent Crime Program is to reduce violent crime and strengthen the relationship between
law enforcement and communities by completing the Problem-Oriented Policing
Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment (SARA) process, building local research
and evaluation capacity, and implementing procedural justice and focused deterrence.

 This funding opportunity was offered to jurisdictions for purposes of assessment for
program implementation. Having reviewed and scored the applications, staff

Total

FFY14
Required
Amount
Match
$121,665
$40,555
$193,063
$64,354
$314,728 $104,909

The differences in funding levels and budget line items of the proposed designations and
the two designations made for the same program at the August 18, 2016, Budget
Committee meeting were discussed.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY14 JAG designations. Mr.
Delfino seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote. Clerk
Brown abstained because she arrived at the meeting after the discussion on this topic had
taken place.
Matching Funds Requirement Waiver Request
Associate Director Givens said that since approval of the designation to the Rockford
Metropolitan Agency for Planning (RMAP) at the August 18, 2016, Budget Committee
Meeting for its Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime Program, the agency has
requested a JAG match waiver. The request was based on the loss of state fiscal year
2017 general revenue funding. No change in the federal designation was requested.
Ms. Northcott explained RMAP was short of funds due to the state’s budget impasse but
still incurred staff costs relating to existing obligations supported by federal and other
fund sources. A discussion ensued regarding matching funds requirements and
procedures to determine waivers of those requirements.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY14 JAG designations. Mr.
Delfino seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote with an
abstention from Ms. Hora.
Public Comment
Public comment was held at the end of the Authority Regular Meeting. No Budget
Committee-related items were discussed at that time.
