Report on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #1)
A. Metrics
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of the Report on the CountyCare
Health Plan. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Chairman Lerner inquired regarding budget estimates for next year. Mr. Glass stated that he plans to provide
the information next month.
During the review of slide 10, Board Chairman Hammock noted that, when thinking about the budget for the
coming year, it looks like CountyCare loses about 1,000 members per month for reasons other than
redetermination; to stay even, in terms of membership, there needs to be 12,000 new members per year,
independent of redeterminations. Mr. Glass concurred. He stated that what is not known is the proportion of
people who are newly covered by Medicaid every month; he indicated that he would take a look at that.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
During the discussion of the information on slide 11, regarding Health Plan Comparisons, Chairman Lerner
inquired whether any updates were available on consolidations of health plans or regarding any new entrants
into the market. Mr. Glass stated that Advocate Accountable Care has declared that they will become a
Managed Care Community Network (MCCN) effective January 1, 2016; this means they will have the same
status as CountyCare, and would be a competitor. They will be a health plan in contract with the State of
Illinois through its Medicaid office, and not under the purview of the Department of Insurance. Mr. Glass
stated that all of the Accountable Care Entities (ACEs) and Coordinated Care Entities (CCEs) have been told
that they must have a plan in place and filed with the State by September 1st, to be effective January 1st.
They either have to link up with a Managed Care Organization (MCO) and their membership becomes the
membership of the MCO, or decide what are they going to do as a business. The Advocate and North Shore
Health System merger means that 90,000 members with Advocate and 40,000 members with North Shore
will combine into one health plan with 130,000 members. Presence has declared that they also will pursue
their own health plan and become an MCCN. It has been announced that MyCare Chicago is partnering with
Molina Health Plan; Molina Health Plan is under contract with the State of Illinois, but not in this region, so
Molina is a new entrant into the market effective January 1st.
Chairman Lerner stated that, if the Committee wants to have a broader discussion about strategic
competition, it would seem to be appropriate to do that during the last quarter of the year. Mr. Glass
concurred; he stated that this could be done at the September meeting, as the Committee is scheduled to do a
deep dive that month.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, inquired regarding information presented on slide 13; he
asked whether there is a way to know of the 847,115 total enrollees in Cook County, which are Affordable
Care Act (ACA) adults? Mr. Glass responded that the State does not break that information out in their
general reporting; however, this is information that can be requested.
With regard to slide 21, Mr. Glass stated that there are a lot of people going to a lot of Emergency
Departments (EDs) all over the place, and there is a concentration in primary care, which is good. Chairman
Lerner noted that, the next logical question for future discussion is - at what point do we talk about whether
we remain a broad-based network versus a narrow-based network?
During the discussion of the information on Care Coordination, Mr. Glass introduced Cheryl Lulias,
President and Chief Executive Officer of MHN ACO, LLC, who provided additional information on the
model of care; additionally, she reviewed the history and governance of MHN ACO, LLC. She noted that it
is a provider-owned and provider-driven collaboration; its members are listed in the presentation. Chairman
Lerner noted that he and Director Velasquez were two of the founding members of MHN.
With regard to the information on driving effective care management presented in slide 33, Chairman Lerner
stated that it would be helpful if this can integrated into the information provided to the Board. One cannot
think about a mass of population, one has to think about cohorts of population and what distinguishes each
cohort of the population. This is one simple template that really distinguishes medical complexity and
provides a great example of the kinds of factoring that has to be done when thinking about the population.

III.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
Dr. Shannon provided comments in a broader context, as it relates to the System overall and to CCHHS as a
provider of care. With regard to the MHN model described that is being performed as standard operating
practice for MHN ACO members, he wants to make sure that the Committee is aware that the hospitals and
ambulatory services are not part of the ACO, but as Mr. Glass was outlining in the model during the
presentation, for what the practice would be for the members of the CountyCare Health Plan, the
administration looks at that as being the model for the care of the people who are in the medical homes of
CCHHS going forward - whether they are CountyCare members, whether they are uninsured, or anything
else. The challenge for CCHHS is going to be how to get that same level of analysis, risk assessment and
support services for those individuals who are entrusted to its care. Chairman Lerner stated that when the
full Board starts to do its strategic planning, it will have to spend some time on that subject, because it is
complex.
Mr. Glass provided a few updates on State-related matters. He stated that, even though there is no State
budget, CountyCare is contractually obligated to continue to pay claims, until such time the State misses two
(2) consecutive months of payments to CountyCare. He noted that the State is current in their payments
through the end of June.
Mr. Glass noted that a court decision was recently made regarding payment of Medicaid claims. The judge
directed that payments should be made for the rates in effect as of June 30th; however, CountyCare’s
contracted amendment with the State states that CountyCare’s payments should return back to the April rates
effective July 1st, so now there is a conflict between what CountyCare’s contract says and what the judge
ordered.
Also with regard to the State and Medicaid payments, Mr. Glass stated that the Sargent Shriver National
Center on Poverty and Law recently filed an emergency motion in federal district court to enforce a consent
decree specifically related to access to specialty services for pediatrics. There was a ruling this morning;
U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow ordered that Illinois should pay hospitals in Cook County for Medicaid
payments, even in the absence of a State budget. The details of what that means are not yet clear; it is not
known whether that will be interpreted as requiring that the State must pay the health plans.
Chairman Lerner concluded by stating that the Committee will be doing a deep dive in September, to talk
about the strategic comparison of CountyCare’s overall plan and the other plans in the market. At some
point, the Committee will have to discuss the issue of broad vs. narrow networks; additionally, the
Committee will need to review the remaining managed care contracts, which is one of its responsibilities.

 What’s Next
• Compare utilization to contracted network for
areas of narrowing
• Analyze network on cost and quality, not just
utilization
• Continued implementation of CCHHS
provider-led initiatives

Page 29 of 42

Board Managed Care Committee   July 23, 2015

 Provider-led Care Coordination
• True Value of ACA requires health insurance
and health practice reforms
• State Approach = ACEs & CCEs
• Shift in State focus for provider-led/providersponsored approach
– ACEs and CCEs in partnership with a MCO or
dissolved by 12/31/2015
– Advocate, Presence, Loyola likely to pursue MCCN
