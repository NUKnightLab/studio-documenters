Manor Drive, in the Countyâ€™s Harrison Hills Park.

Sponsors: Chief Executive

At the request of the Chair, the clerk read the title of the bill and Mr. McKain summarized
its provisions, noting that the proposal is for a three year agreement running though
February of 2021, with a 2 year option at the discretion of the County. Mr. McKain noted
that the rental rate would be $1,500 per year, which is approximately double the current
rate. Mr. McKain summarized their usage patterns, and noted that they do undertake
maintenance functions. Mr. Baechle noted that Highlands Area Soccer Club would be
constructing a maintenance shed, which would become County property, and that HASC
has adequate insurance.
In response to a question from Ms. Means, Mr. McKain noted that applicable law requires
that all employees maintain the appropriate clearances.

The Chair suggested that there may be wisdom in clarifying that the rental rate may
remain the same during the option period, or may not. Mr. McKain noted that flexibility to
adjust the rental rate is built into the option rate, but that no decision would likely be
made until the option is exercised.
A motion was made by Means, seconded by Prizio, that this matter be
Affirmatively Recommended. The motion carried by a unanimous vote.

V. Adjournment
The meeting was adjourned at 4:11.
