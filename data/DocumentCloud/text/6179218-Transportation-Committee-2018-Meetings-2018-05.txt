1. The committee reviewed final concepts and preliminary costs for WPB Wayfinding project,
presented by Bud Rodecker with Thirst Communications. Votes were tallied by the committeeâ€™s
voting members to select the final design for the kiosks, directional arrow signs, placemaking
icons, and tree grate wayfinding.
a. Thirst received quotes from two fabricators for wayfinding kiosks, Poblocki and Xibitz,
who provided cost estimates for 3 kiosks to be located throughout WPB/SSA #33 Service
Area. Additional cost estimates from fabricators making directional arrow signs,
placemaking icons, and tree grate wayfinding will be provided in time for the next
committee meeting.
b. The committee voted to move forward with Poblocki as the fabricator for wayfinding
kiosks and will await final cost estimates for materials and installation for the chosen
design. Fabricator will next prepare shop drawings indicating design in more detail in
the near future.
2. The committee discussed updates on current projects including bench installations along
Division St., bike rack installation in the SSA, and updates on the soon to be installed planter
boxes along Milwaukee Ave. Benches will be installed in 2 weeks by vendor Why Not Iron; bike
racks are awaiting siting with assistance from CDOT; and planters will be installed and filled with
plantings the week of May 14.
3. The committee also had a preliminary discussion about setting the 2019 committee budget
