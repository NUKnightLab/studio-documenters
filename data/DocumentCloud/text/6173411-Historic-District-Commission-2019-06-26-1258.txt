STAFF REPORT 06-26-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6283
ADDRESS: 1258 WASHINGTON BOULEVARD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: WASHINGTON BOULEVARD
APPLICANT: JAMES FLORA, DETROIT BEER EXCHANGE LLC

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

PROPOSAL
The building located at 1258 Washington Boulevard is an 8-story Renaissance Revival style office building constructed
in 1901. The oldest building in the Washington Boulevard Historic District, the structure is clad in red brick with
limestone and terra-cotta detailing. Additionally, it features varying window types and an ornate Italian Romanesque
cornice. An Art Moderne style façade is featured on the lower levels of the building.

With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to complete the following work
associated with the overall rehabilitation of the building, specifically a tenant build-out for a restaurant at the basement
and first level of the existing building. Although Resolution 19-01 allows HDC staff to approve exterior wall
penetrations for the installation of ventilation/mechanical, electrical, or plumbing utilities at the side and rear elevations,
staff is unable to approve the addition of rooftop mechanical units. See attached drawings for locations of the following
proposed work items:
•
•
•

Installation of (2) new mechanical rooftop units on the existing 2nd floor roof. The second floor roof is located
at the southeast corner of the building and faces the alley located adjacent to the building on the east side (see
attached photos and drawings).
Installation of (2) wall-mounted air intake ductwork on the east (alley side) façade.
Installation of (2) exhaust grilles and (1) wall-mounted fan at various locations on east (alley side) façade (see
attached drawings for locations).

 STAFF OBSERVATIONS
This proposal is a revision to a previous application which was approved by the Commission at their regularly
scheduled meeting held on November 14, 2018 (see attached staff report and Certificate of Appropriateness for general
rehab scope included in previous submission).
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1)

Height. The buildings in the Washington Boulevard Local Historic District range from two (2) to thirty-six (36) stories
tall.
(7) Relationship of Materials. The major building materials common to wall surfaces in the district are limestone, brick, and
terra-cotta. Many granite bases also exist. Facades are often trimmed with limestone and/or terra cotta. Pilasters,
window frames and spandrels of the Industrial Building are bronze. Window frames are of wood or steel; building grates
and the framing of storefront windows and doors are generally metal. The side elevations, where not prominent, and the
rear elevations of the buildings in the district are brick. Visible structures above the roof line of the Book-Cadillac Hotel
and the Book Tower are roofed in copper. The doors of Saint Aloysius Roman Catholic Church are bronze and the doors
of the Chancery Building are wood. The names of street intersections in bronze letters are located on buildings on corner
lots above the first floor. Metal fire escapes hang from the rear of several buildings.
(8) Relationship of Textures. The low relief pattern of mortar joints in brick, terra cotta or limestone juxtaposed with smooth
masonry trim, where it exists, provides textural interest. Glazed terra cotta, polished granite and large glass surfaces are
smooth in texture. Carved or molded repetitive ornamental elements and detail in terra cotta, metal or masonry contrasts
with the surface material, providing a high degree of textural interest. Subdivided windows, decorative spandrels,
parapets and cornices with repetitive detail, where they still exist, are often areas of textural interest. In general, the
district is extremely rich in textural relationships.
(10) Relationship of Architectural Details. Architectural details generally relate to architectural styles. Early twentieth
century buildings in the Beaux Arts, Renaissance Revival, and Italian Romanesque styles exhibit round arches,
cartouches, quoins, fluted pilasters, and other classically derived details. The surfaces between windows, the tops of
pilasters, cornices and string courses tend to be decorated, often very ornately. The Chancery Building and Saint Aloysius
Roman Catholic Church display Italian Renaissance and Romanesque inspiration. Both buildings have gabled roof lines,
arched windows, arcading and decorative pilasters. Storefronts typically have apron walls and large expanses of glass,
most in their original configurations. The two (2), two-story buildings are of a plainer Art Deco design with modest
classical details.
(11) Relationship of Roof Shapes. Most roofs of the Washington Boulevard Local Historic District are not visible from the
street, with the exceptions of the Saint Aloysius Roman Catholic Church roof, which is gabled; the four (4) two-story
pavilions with pyramidal stepped roofs rising from the corners above the roof line of Book-Cadillac Hotel; and the tall,
hipped copper roof of the Book Tower. Penthouses, some containing mechanical systems, also exist above the roof lines
of some of the buildings.
(22) General Environmental Character. The general character of the Washington Boulevard Local Historic District is that of
a mostly intact assemblage of well-designed, classically inspired and elegant commercial buildings lining the once grand
Washington Boulevard streetscape. Saint Aloysius Roman Catholic Church and the Chancery Building are compatible
with the rest of the district in materials, openings, setbacks and other elements of design. As part of the historic
Woodward Plan, the Washington Boulevard Local Historic District is located in the midst of other historic sections of
downtown, including Grand Circus Park, the Theater District, Capitol Park, Lower Woodward Avenue, and Harmony
Park. It is strategically located for redevelopment.

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the Commission find the project scope, as proposed, to be appropriate as it meets the following
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
•

1) A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal
change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.

•

2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(2)
Proportion of Buildings’ Front Facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on the size of
the building, its period of construction, and its function. Most of the front facades of individual
buildings are taller than wide but may have visible side elevations wider than tall when located on
corner lots. Two-story buildings are significantly wider than tall. The upper stories of some of the
taller buildings have modest setbacks.
(6)
Rhythm of Entrance And/or Porch Projections. Most of the original entrances facing Washington
Boulevard are centered on the facades of individual buildings or, where there are multiple
storefronts, are arranged in a regular pattern along the street facade. The Washington Boulevard
entrance of the Book-Cadillac Hotel is off-center; its Michigan Avenue entrance is centered. While

(15)

some entrance openings are recessed, as with the Book Building, no facade projections beyond the
front lot line exist at ground level. Marquees and awnings above first floor entrances were and are
common.
Relationship of Materials. The major building materials common to wall surfaces in the district are
limestone, brick, and terra-cotta. Many granite bases also exist. Facades are often trimmed with
limestone and/or terra cotta. Pilasters, window frames and spandrels of the Industrial Building are
bronze. Window frames are of wood or steel; building grates and the framing of storefront windows
and doors are generally metal. The side elevations, where not prominent, and the rear elevations of
the buildings in the district are brick. Visible structures above the roof line of the Book-Cadillac
Hotel and the Book Tower are roofed in copper. The doors of Saint Aloysius Roman Catholic
Church are bronze and the doors of the Chancery Building are wood. The names of street
intersections in bronze letters are located on buildings on corner lots above the first floor. Metal fire
escapes hang from the rear of several buildings.
Relationship of Textures. The low relief pattern of mortar joints in brick, terra cotta or limestone
juxtaposed with smooth masonry trim, where it exists, provides textural interest. Glazed terra cotta,
polished granite and large glass surfaces are smooth in texture. Carved or molded repetitive
ornamental elements and detail in terra cotta, metal or masonry contrasts with the surface material,
providing a high degree of textural interest. Subdivided windows, decorative spandrels, parapets and
cornices with repetitive detail, where they still exist, are often areas of textural interest. In general,
the district is extremely rich in textural relationships.
Relationship of Colors. The majority of buildings in the Washington Boulevard Local Historic
District are in a light color range. Within this range, many are clad and/or trimmed in light beige
limestone. 1420 Washington Boulevard is sheathed in white terra-cotta. Buff brick is plentiful;
brown and orange brick also exists. Buildings sheathed in limestone often have brick side and rear
elevations in light shades of brick. Window frames tend to be painted in brown, deep green, or a
cream color. Pink, black and gray granite faces the base of several buildings. Where there are
copper clad roof and penthouse pavilions and terraces, they have weathered blue-green. St.
Aloysius Roman Catholic Church has bronze doors and the Chancery Building has stained wood
doors. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always
acceptable, and may provide guidance for similar buildings.
Relationship of Architectural Details. Architectural details generally relate to architectural styles.
Early twentieth century buildings in the Beaux Arts, Renaissance Revival, and Italian Romanesque
styles exhibit round arches, cartouches, quoins, fluted pilasters, and other classically derived details.
The surfaces between windows, the tops of pilasters, cornices and string courses tend to be
decorated, often very ornately. The Chancery Building and Saint Aloysius Roman Catholic Church
display Italian Renaissance and Romanesque inspiration. Both buildings have gabled roof lines,
arched windows, arcading and decorative pilasters. Storefronts typically have apron walls and large
expanses of glass, most in their original configurations. The two (2), two-story buildings are of a
plainer Art Deco design with modest classical details.
Walls of Continuity. A strong, overall wall of continuity is formed by the buildings that abut and are
sited on the front lot line. While the red steel pipe environmental structure that stretches for blocks
creates continuity by extending in a meandering but linear fashion along the plaza, its design bears
no relationship to the historic nature of the streetscape.
Relationship of Significant Landscape Features and Surface Treatments. Front facades of buildings
are located on the front lot lines, with a narrow border of concrete paving before the brick-paved
public sidewalk. Brick paving, concrete walls, trees in metal grates, trolley tracks and the red metal
environmental structure replaced the eastern side of the broad boulevard formerly ornamented with
stone balustrades, formal promenades, statuary and Beaux-Arts light standards. A multi-lane twoway roadbed is now on the west side of the public right-of-way adjoining the sidewalk adjacent to
the building on the west side of the street. Concrete planters line the sidewalks.
Scale of Facades and Facade Elements. Individual building facades range from moderate to large in

 REPORT

(19)

(21)

(22)

scale, with the majority being in the large range. Details and elements within individual facades
range from moderate to large in scale; the repetition of moderately scaled detail is common while the
use of large and oversized elements also exists, particularly on the Book-Cadillac Hotel, Book Tower
and Book Building. Signage was placed above the ground floor storefront windows, often in a panel
designed for such purpose; sometimes it was part of a marquee or awning, or as a structure on top of
the building.
Directional Expression of Front Elevations. While most individual buildings are vertical in
directional expression, they form a horizontal row along the streetscape where they abut. The two
(2) horizontally oriented two-story buildings further emphasize the horizontality of the streetscape.
The front facade of Saint Aloysius Roman Catholic Church is oriented vertically, due primarily to
the thrust of the central bay with its gable surmounted by a cross.
Degree of Complexity Within the Facades. The degree of complexity ranges from simple to
complex, depending on style and building type. Several buildings are heavily embellished with
decorative detail and ornamentation; these tend to be more complex. Some of the buildings exhibit
complex massing of their upper stories.
Orientation, Vistas, Overviews. Individual buildings are oriented toward Washington Boulevard; the
Book-Cadillac Hotel has a secondary entrance oriented towards Michigan Avenue. Corner buildings
sometimes have secondary or office/elevator lobby entrances oriented toward the side street. A
varied and interesting silhouette results from the different roof shapes and heights of buildings on
Washington Boulevard. Washington Boulevard is one of the streets that emanates like spokes from
Grand Circus Park, resulting in unique vistas.
Symmetric or Asymmetric Appearance. Most buildings are symmetrical in appearance above the
first floor. Many were symmetrical on the first floor as well, depending on the position and number
of storefront openings. Multiple changes to the storefronts, including covering them over, has
occurred, although a very high degree of integrity still exists. Saint Aloysius Roman Catholic
Church is symmetrical on its front (west) facade.
General Environmental Character. The general character of the Washington Boulevard Local
Historic District is that of a mostly intact assemblage of well-designed, classically inspired and
elegant commercial buildings lining the once grand Washington Boulevard streetscape. Saint
Aloysius Roman Catholic Church and the Chancery Building are compatible with the rest of the
district in materials, openings, setbacks and other elements of design. As part of the historic
Woodward Plan, the Washington Boulevard Local Historic District is located in the midst of other
historic sections of downtown, including Grand Circus Park, the Theater District, Capitol Park,
Lower Woodward Avenue, and Harmony Park. It is strategically located for redevelopment.

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that all of the proposed work items are appropriate, however, staff chooses to withhold a
recommendation based on lack of detailed documentation. Additionally, staff has suggested the applicant come to the
November 14th HDC meeting prepared with the requested documentation.
