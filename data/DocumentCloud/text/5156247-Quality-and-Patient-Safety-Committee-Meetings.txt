 Goals
Baseline SIR =1.1
Reduce CLABSI by 40%

Goal not met but below
benchmarks, SIR 0.79
Illinois SIR=0.82
Nat’l. SIR=0.99

Gaps/Barriers/Best Practice

Corrective Measures

Gaps/Barriers:
• Lack of consistent use of CHG
(Chlorhexidine gluconate)
• Catheter hubs not disinfected
• Daily assessment for catheter need

• Feedback to leadership and units
• Educate staff /patients
• Monitor use of CHG bath and
need for central lines
• Scrub the Hub/Multi-use vial
campaign

central lines

Best Practices:
• Decrease central line use
• Use of midline vs. central line
• Restricted blood draw from
PICC(peripherally inserted central

 Goals
Baseline SIR =1.4

Goal met
SIR 0.32
IL SIR=0.89
Nat’l. SIR=0.99

Gaps/Barriers
• Inconsistent daily assessment for
catheter need
• Inconsistent use of CHG bath

location-present on admission,
discontinuation, care and
maintenance.)

Goals
Reduce Surgical Site

by the end of 2018
Goal met
SIR 0.36
State=Colon SIR 0.90,
Hyst=0.83
Nat’l. = All SSI SIR 1.0

Corrective Measures

Gaps/Barriers
• Need for more comprehensive
surveillance (i.e. use of diagnosis
codes, electronic query,
readmission status, ID consults,
culture results).
• Patient risk factors include morbid
obesity, length of surgery,
co-morbidities

•
•
•
•

Feedback to leadership & staff
Staff /Patient education
Implemented CHG bathing
Provided oversight of cleaning
disinfection and sterilization
• Monitor storage of sterile equipment/
supplies, & processes /procedures
system wide.
• Enhanced surveillance

 Goals

Gaps/Barriers

Corrective Measures

Reduce C-difficile acquisition
by 40% (SIR=0.6) the end of
2018.

Gap Analysis:
• Increased hospital onset C-difficile in
May 2018 (11 cases).
• Increased colonization pressure/
incidence density thus increased
possibility of transmission.
• Risk factors; antibiotic use, commode
use, common staff, ICU exposure
• Lapses in cleaning and disinfection
practices/use of bleach and equipment
e.g . toilet brush

• Feedback to leadership and staff.
• Use of bleach disinfectants.
• Cleaning process and use of
disposable toilet brush reviewed
with Env. Service
• Automated isolation orders.
• Staff and Environ. Services education
• CDI cases reported daily to EVS
• Antimicrobial Stewardship

Goal not met
SIR 0.81, but lower than
benchmarks.
