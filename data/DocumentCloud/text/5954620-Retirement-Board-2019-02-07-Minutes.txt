e. Executive Director Report
The Executive Director stated that she and Trustee Ochalla had attended the meeting of the
Cook County Board of Commissioners on January 24, 2019. At the meeting, the
Commissioners adopted a resolution that the Executive Director should appear before the
Pension Committee to provide an update of the Fund and the 2019 outlook. She added that
no meeting date had been proposed, but that she would advise the Board of the date once it is
scheduled.
The Executive Director presented the vendor schedules that had been requested by the Board.
A separate schedule was provided for vendors who received annual payments in excess of
$10,000. The schedule included information about the renewal dates of the contract,
indication if the Board approved the contract, and as applicable, the date of Board approval.
Another schedule was provided indicating all administrative expense vendors that were paid
in 2018. Payments made to investment managers were not included in the analysis, but
would be provided at a later meeting.
Regarding procurement, Ms. Tuczak noted that the Board’s minutes of December 5, 2013,
indicated parameters of approval of certain contract renewals, expenditures of less than
$10,000 and consents required by investment agreements.
Consistent with the Board’s direction in 2013, Ms. Tuczak indicated that she wanted to enter
a renegotiated agreement with ADP for Fund staff payroll which would reduce the annual fee
by about $12,000, and additionally, Ms. Tuczak indicated that she intended to negotiate a
Statement of Work with CDW to provide additional capacity on the Fund’s network systems.
6

 The trustees stated that proceeding with the ADP and CDW matters under the current policy
was acceptable, but discussed whether the authority given to the Executive Director should
be limited to $5,000 and whether other parameters should be considered. The trustees also
discussed whether all amendments to a contract should be considered by the Board. The
Executive Director stated that a revision of the directions given by the Board on December 5,
2013, would be prepared for the next meeting.
The Executive Director stated that she had begun to meet individually with staff members to
gain an understanding of the Fund’s operations and to evaluate its efficiencies. These
reviews will better enable the Executive Director to assess the pending pension
administration system (PAS) project, but may delay the start of the PAS project.
The Executive Director reminded the trustees about discussion at the last month’s meeting
regarding the opening of the Fund’s office on Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, February 12,
2019, in exchange for closure on Tuesday, December 24, 2019. Similarly, the Fund’s office
would be open on Casimir Pulaski Day, March 4, 2019, but closed on Friday, July 5, 2019.
She added that upon investigation, it was determined that Fund employees did not have a
floating holiday. Instead, the practice was started about ten years ago that the floating
holiday offered to many Cook County employees was taken by Fund staff on the Friday after
Thanksgiving and the office would be closed that day.
The Executive Director reminded the Board that the Legislative Committee would meet on
February 14, 2019, at 9:30 am and that the Investment Committee would meet on February
27, 2019, at 9:30 am.
The summary of the cost of living adjustments received by Fund employees from January 1,
2009, was also presented as the Board had requested at its meeting in January.
The Executive Director recommended that the Fund obtain a Corporate Costco membership
for $120, which would allow the Fund to order office supplies and to pay for the items upon
delivery. It was noted that the Costco membership card was not a credit card and would not
include any line-of-credit facility.
4. Health Matters
a. Extension of Contract with Segal
Jane Hawes, Director of Health Benefits, stated that the Fund’s agreement with its two
principal health vendors, United Healthcare and Segal Consulting, would both expire on
December 31, 2020. Ms. Hawes stated that the Fund would be at a disadvantage if the
engagements of both vendors expired simultaneously. She requested authority from the
Board to negotiate an extension of the Segal contract through December 31, 2021, and that
the renegotiated terms would be presented to the Board at a subsequent meeting for their
approval.
It was moved by Trustee Ochalla and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board authorizes
Fund staff to negotiate with Segal Consulting an extension of the existing Agreement through

7

 December 31, 2021, and that the terms of any such extension be presented to the Board at a
subsequent meeting.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

b. EGWP Contract Term Update
Ms. Hawes reported that the Fund had received a commitment letter from CVS confirming
their intent to provide additional EGWP pricing improvements for 2020 and 2021. Action on
an EGWP RFP has been postposed pending CVS’ additional pricing proposal. Segal intends
to present a savings analysis of the CVS proposal at the meeting on March 7, 2019.
5. Legislative Matters
a. Proposed Legislation – Submission by John McCabe Associates Ltd.

It was noted that John McCabe of John McCabe Associates Ltd. had submitted legislation on
behalf of the Fund with two elements: (1) actuarially-based funding and (2) allowance of the
employer to utilize revenues from sources other than the tax levy to provide funding to the
Fund. This legislation was presented prior to the February 1, 2019, deadline, however,
without approval from the Board or the Fund’s Executive Director. Ms. Tuczak indicated
that John McCabe was scheduled to present this information to the Board at the meeting.
Sarah Boeckman, of Burke Burns & Pinelli, Ltd., addressed the Board prior to the Fund’s
legislative consultant entering the meeting room. Ms. Boeckman noted her concern that
legislation had been entered in Springfield to the Legislative Reference Bureau (“LRB”)
without authority from the Board or communication with the Fund or Legislative Committee
It was discussed that the County, as employer, should be approached about funding
legislation before it is introduced. The Fund may need to initiate the dialogue and bring any
specifics of the legislation to the appropriate parties at the County. In addition, President
Wilson stated that a dialogue should be started by the Fund, via the Executive Director, for
pension reform with the County. Any specifics of proposed legislation should be returned to
the Board. In addition, to improve communication with the legislative consultant, the Fund
should schedule regular telephone calls for status reports.
Ms. Boeckman provided the Board with a copy of HB 2071, which amends Article 9 to allow
employees to purchase service credit for periods of furlough beginning on or after December
1, 2017, and ending on or before November 30, 2018.
b. Draft Legislation for Board Review

John McCabe and Robert Molaro of John McCabe & Associates addressed the Board about
the status of the Fund’s proposed legislation. Mr. McCabe stated that because of the
legislative calendar, he submitted proposed legislation to the LRB to provide for actuarially
required contributions from the employer (“ARC funding”) for both the County Fund and the
Forest Fund based upon bills that had been submitted in prior years. The legislation also
included language which amended the source of funds that could be used for contributions
paid by the County. In addition, he submitted a proposal for separate legislation that did not
8

 include ARC funding, but was limited to an amendment regarding the County’s funding
sources for employer contributions. McCabe stated that the draft legislation was returned to
him from the LRB, but had not been released to any other person. McCabe also addressed
the Board about HB 2071. He inquired about whether the bill would have a financial impact
on the Fund, and if the Board had a position on the legislation. Fund staff noted that the
payroll records received from the County do not indicate when an employee might be on
furlough and it would not be possible to determine how many employees would be affected
by the bill or the related cost.
Robert Molaro stated that the proposed amendment for ARC funding was significant
legislation and asked if there would be opposition to its enactment. He added that any failure
to communicate with the Board or the Fund about the proposed legislation rested with the
legislative consultant and not with the Fund.
The trustees discussed that the legislation presented by McCabe to the LRB for ARC funding
had a few flaws and that the Fund staff had prepared legislation for the Board’s consideration
which corrected those deficiencies. The trustees also discussed that any proposal for ARC
funding would not likely be successful unless all stakeholders were in agreement with the
legislation. Ms. Boeckman stated that in the opinion of fiduciary counsel, the Board as
fiduciaries should pursue legislation for ARC funding, particularly since the Fund was the
only remaining public pension plan in Illinois without this type of funding.
It was moved by Trustee Goode and seconded by Trustee Nevius that the Board approve the
proposed legislation prepared by Fund staff for actuarially based funding for both the County
Fund and the Forest Preserve Fund, including the amendment relating to the source of
funding for the County, and authorize the Legislative Representative to submit the indicated
legislation for introduction before the Illinois General Assembly.
