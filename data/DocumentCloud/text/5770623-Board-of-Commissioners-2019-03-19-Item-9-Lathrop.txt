Background
The CHA Board approved the selection of Lathrop Community Partners, LLC, an Illinois limited
liability company (LCP) on October 19, 2010 and CHA entered into a Contract for Redevelopment
of Julia C. Lathrop Homes with LCP on October 1, 2011.

 LCP originally borrowed $3,441,283.75 for predevelopment expenses related to Lathrop Phase I,
which was approved by the Chicago Housing Authority’s Board of Commissioners on May 16,
2014 (Resolution No. 2014-CHA-49). At the closing of Phase IA, there remained an outstanding
balance of $3,197,153 on the original predevelopment loan. However, $2,500,000 of those
funds was escrowed to address the National Park Services (NPS) requirement that the exterior
work on all of the rehabbed buildings comply with historic requirements. The only building north
of Diversey (commonly referred to as the T-Building) not included in Phase 1A was required to be
completed in a timely manner. By the creation of the escrow, CHA and LCP reassured NPS that
funds would be available for the exterior historic work allowing NPS to issue the Part III
certification needed for the historic tax credits allocated for Phase 1A. This portion of the Phase
1 loan was not repaid or otherwise accounted for at the Phase 1A closing and remains in escrow
until the work on the T-Building is completed.
Currently, LCP is seeking to close on financing on Phase 1B and 1C which will consist of 223 units
in both existing historic buildings and new construction buildings. The original predevelopment
loan did not contemplate the vast size of Phase 1 so additional predevelopment funds are needed
for predevelopment costs.

 Development Entities
Lathrop Community Partners LLC(LCP) was selected as the master development team in January
2010, and consists of 3 team members: Related Midwest, Bickerdike Redevelopment Corp., and
Heartland Housing. In October 2011, LCP entered into a development agreement with the CHA.
CHA Financing
The subject resolution will authorize CHA to increase the funding amount of the Phase 1
predevelopment loan by an amount not to exceed $1,840,850. The proposed predevelopment
loan increase will not exceed 75% of eligible third-party costs for rental units only, consistent
with U.S. Department of Urban Development cost control guidelines and regulation. The loan
funds will help fund a portion of predevelopment costs which include but are not limited to
architect, engineering, design development and construction documents, permit fees, legal
services, surveys, and market studies. All predevelopment loan repayment funds to CHA will be
converted to construction/permanent loan funds at the Phase 1B and 1C real estate closing
transactions. LCP will cover the remaining 25% of eligible predevelopment costs.
