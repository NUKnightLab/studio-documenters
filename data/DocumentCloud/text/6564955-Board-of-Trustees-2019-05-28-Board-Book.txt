Public Comment:
There was no public comment.
Report of the Board President:
President Shlonsky stated that the Executive Director search is underway. Applications are due mid-May.
Ads have been placed and recruitment brochures have been distributed and the awareness is growing.
Report of the Executive Director:
Executive Director Feldman stated she is hearing that the recruitment brochure is widely admired. CCPL
Solon Branch will close at 5:30 p.m. on July 3rd for fireworks, and CCPL Strongsville Branch will close at
5:30 p.m. on July 17th for the Homecoming Parade.
Executive Director Feldman mentioned TSD Specialist Mary Schreiber had a book published in March.
The book is titled, Partnering with Parents: Boosting Literacy for All Ages.”
Executive Director Feldman mentioned Deputy Director Strobel has been named co-chair of the
Education Committee of Cuyahoga County’s Complete Count Committee. This is Cuyahoga County’s
census project to ensure that people complete and return the 2020 census. You may recall that she is
leading this effort for ALA, so it is great that she will have the ability to work on the census locally.
Deputy Director Strobel gave an update on CCPL’s Safety and Security. She stated safety for our
customers and our staff while in our branches is one of our top priorities. There have been events locally
and nationally that have brought increased focus on the fact that we work in a very public and open
setting and there are vulnerabilities that we must pay close attention to. We must and we do work
diligently to minimize these vulnerabilities while at the same time maximizing both safety and open
access. Recently, she along with, Operations Director Morgan, Human Resources Director Sample, and
Facilities Director Mori convened a safety summit with representatives from the Union, and Security
Coordinators Loggins, and Grame.
Recent Improvements:
 Additional cameras have been added and upgraded
 Monitor hours were increased in some locations
 Stronger school relationships were established with Warrensville Heights School
 Security Coordinator Loggins, and Security Coordinator Grame trained staff at all Branch
meetings
 Updated and redistributed Run, Hide, Fight training document
 Strengthening police department relationships
 Additional technological and building security plans are underway
 Convene the safety summit on a regular basis
 for Security Coordinator Loggins, and Security Coordinator Grame
Deputy Director Strobel thanked Facilities Director Mori, Security Coordinator Loggins, and Security
Coordinator Grame for leading the safety and security efforts. They do an outstanding job and are
extremely committed.
Director Sample presented CCPL Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan Update. Handouts were
provided. Once people join our team, we need to provide them with opportunities to help them grow. We
have developed a systematic way for management to plan their future and develop skillsets. The
recruitment and selection process are critical for our organization. The skillset for those that are on our
hiring teams are one of the most crucial factors; making sure in the interview process to recognize unique
skillsets that will help our workforce. There is some progress when it comes to building more diversity
into our workforce, but there is a lot of work to be done.
Director Sample Introduced Talia Seals, CCPL Talent Manager, and her efforts in leading diversity and
inclusion in our path forward.

Trustee Leonard asked are you happy with the progress that has been made?
Director Sample stated we are putting in the foundation that will allow us to be very intentional how we
bring talent into the organization to make significant progress on how we want the workforce to look going
forward.
Trustee Blakemore asked Director Sample to give an update on the interview team and his perspective.
Director Sample stated we were over taxing the same managers too often for interviews because we
don’t have enough diverse people in the hiring rotation to do the diverse hiring. We will take a pause and
reevaluate the diverse hiring pool.
Trustee Varley asked when you look at hiring trends are there any aspirational goals?
Director Sample stated we look to make sure that the workforce at a particular branch reflects the
community that surrounds it.
Executive Director Feldman commented we recognize that we don’t have a strong enough pipeline to
feed promotional opportunities. We are currently seeking a diverse pool of candidates for a position at
Warrensville Heights, and we are struggling to create that diverse group of candidates internally and
externally. The strength of our tuition program is an opportunity to grow and develop our internal talent
for positions.
Trustee Blakemore encourages the Library to set a goal as something to aspire to. Even if it isn’t met, it
helps to have a goal to work toward.
Report of the CCPL Foundation Board Liaison:
Trustee Blakemore CCPL’s Liaison, for the Foundation Board mentioned that the last Foundation Board
meeting was held on March 12th. The next Foundation Board meeting is May14th and will be held at
CCPL South Euclid-Lyndhurst Branch. The Board will meet with author Eric Klinenberg following the
meeting for a reception and author talk. He invited everyone to attend.
Trustee Blakemore mentioned the Writer’s Center Stage (WCS) season will be announced tomorrow
night following our event with author Jennifer Egan. Sponsors are already committed. We are
anticipating about $70,000 in revenue from the season. The annual golf event will be on June 10th.
Human Resources Report:
Director Sample offered an update on some of the ideas presented at the previous Policy Planning &
External Relations (PPER) Committee meeting. We discussed the Social Media Policy and are now
rethinking and considering a broader policy of overall staff conduct. This will be forthcoming.
Director Sample referred the Board to the report provided.
03-04/2019
Trustee Varley moved approval, seconded by Trustee Spangler. Seeing no discussion, the Human
Resources Report dated April 30, 2019, was approved as presented by unanimous vote of the Board
members present. (See pages 122-128)

Finance Committee Report:
Finance Committee Chair Leonard reminded us that the Finance Committee met prior to the Board
meeting, and Director Morgan gave an in-depth review of the financials.
Director Morgan gave highlights from the Finance report. He stated that the County’s property tax
advancements have come in to total about 54% of the entire budget. This doesn’t mean we should
expect more; this is how the County disburses funds. We believe we are on target with our proposed
budget. The Public Library Fund (PLF) was down a bit, but we have received our April disbursement that
put us back in line with where we anticipated to be. Patron fines and fees are still up, due mainly to
passports.
(See under FINANCE)
Investments - March
Director Morgan stated we purchased three certificates of deposit. We also changed a bit of our
investment strategy. We have been able to receive better returns on the STAR Ohio Accounts instead of
our traditional money market account, so we have been keeping more funds in the STAR Ohio Accounts.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
SUMMER LEARNING AT THE LIBRARY
Summer at Cuyahoga County Public Library is an exciting time because
we offer young people so many unforgettable learning experiences
and activities. Our summer reading program is just the beginning –
one part of a continuum of out-of-school time programming that keeps
kids productively engaged, safe and entertained during the summer
months.
This summer, in addition to our abundance of quality youth programs,
we are offering more than 80 free summer camps designed to help
students build valuable skills that translate to success in the classroom
and beyond. Our wildly popular camps provide students with
opportunities to express their creativity using emerging technologies,
conduct science experiments, explore coding languages and use
engineering fundamentals to create robots and crazy contraptions.
Our 2019 summer camps are made possible through the generous
support of The Char and Chuck Fowler Family Foundation, The
Cleveland-Cliffs Foundation, The Hankins Foundation, Rockwell
Automation, the City of Warrensville Heights and individual donors.
We thank all of our camp sponsors for supporting the work we do to
keep students actively engaged in hands-on learning this summer.
Our summer programs help meet students’ out-of-school time learning
needs, but we also know that many children in our communities depend
on the stability and nutrition offered by school lunch programs. When
school is out for the summer their access to healthy food may be very
limited. We help ﬁll the void by partnering with the Greater Cleveland
Food Bank to offer free lunches to children ages 18 and younger at 10
branch locations. This summer, from early June to early August, our
summer lunch locations will receive thousands of visits from hungry
children. The summer lunch program helps meet nutrition needs for
our community children and thanks to our volunteer lunchtime readers
and our staff, reading and learning are at the center of summer life.
Regards,

Executive Director

#OhioHD12 Did you know @Warrensville_OH has a podcast? Did you know it’s recorded at the STUDIO
at the Warrensville @CuyahogaLib ? Thank you June for inviting me to be on the show to discuss the
Operating Budget just passed in the Ohio House!
@Juanita_Brent, May 20, 2019

What a fantastic crowd last night at the @CuyahogaLib. On this book tour I’m really enjoying the depth
of audience questions about process and creativity. I was so wired that after dinner I watched Aliens in its
entirety. Still a perfect ﬁlm.
@donttrythis (Adam Savage), May 17, 2019

Thanks @CuyahogaLib for hosting last night’s screening of @SutherlandFilms’ “Marcos Doesn’t Live Here
Anymore.” It was honor to join @USMC Staff Sgt Elizabeth Perez (Ret) & Director David Sutherland for the
post screening panel.
@DavidLeopold, May 3, 2019

The Strongsville Branch, in partnership with the Strongsville Historical Society, presented a talk on World War
II and the home front. The speakers told the story of a resident from Strongsville that survived the Battle of the
Bulge. The audience of 50 and the speaker were shocked and moved when that man got up, introduced himself
and spoke about his experience!
The North Royalton Branch was honored to host author Allen Lynch, one of only 72 living Medal of Honor
recipients. Lynch discussed his new memoir, Zero to Hero: From Bullied Kid to Warrior. Accompanied by a
military escort, 67 people came to hear how Lynch went from being bullied on the playground in 1950s Illinois
to the battleﬁelds of Vietnam – and the demons he’s battled ever since.
Susannah Hamm (Parma Branch) and Megan Barrett (Literacy and Learning Division) lead a community dialogue
for Project Build, which was attended by 12 educators, community members and Parma City School District
Superintendent Dr. Charles Smialek. The attendees were very enthused about helping to identify opportunities
for informal STEAM learning in the community. ASCE News published an article about the project in its April 18
issue titled, “Project BUILD Connects Students, Engineers and Libraries.”
The Foundation Center (now Candid) presented “Introduction to Finding Grants for Nonproﬁts” at the Berea
Branch. Twenty-seven people from a wide variety of nonproﬁt organizations learned the 10 most important
things to know about ﬁnding grants and many other useful facts about the process. The Foundation Directory
Online is available free of charge at the Berea Branch in partnership with Baldwin Wallace University. Adult staff
members received additional instruction from the presenter, and also set up accounts so that they could continue
self-directed learning through the Center’s comprehensive website.

The Fairview Park Branch hosted a “Bluegrass in the Spring” concert with faculty from the Cleveland Music
Settlement. This joint endeavor was funded, in part, through a grant and through the Friends of Fairview Park
Library. Thirty-eight people attended the program, which included a history of bluegrass music and lots of music
played on stand-up bass, guitar, mandolin and banjo.
The South Euclid-Lyndhurst Branch partnered with Kaplan books to hold a pilot program on preparing for the AP
calculus test. Eight students were shown strategies for taking the test by the author of the popular Barron’s AP Calculus
books. Each student was given Barron’s AP books as well as access to the practice tests as part of the program.
A Garﬁeld Heights Branch customer has been using the branch’s recording studio to record an audiobook called
Woman Up. The book is a collection of empowering true stories and monologues told by local women. We look
forward to listening to her book when it’s completed.
Isabel Klein (Warrensville Heights Branch) led the Great Stories Club (GSC) at the Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile
Correctional Facility (CHJCF) and co-hosted (with CHJCF librarian Katie Hemly) the GSC Completion Party at the
correctional facility. Two of the incarcerated youth who participated in the GSC presented their experiences and
received certiﬁcates for completing the program.
Twenty homeschooled world explorers visited Russia – in the Orange Branch’s meeting rooms. Julia Doyle, a member
of the adult reference staff who is from Russia, assisted Meghan Villhauer to put on the program. Julia taught the
children some words and phrases in Russian and helped them write their names using the Russian alphabet.
The Beachwood Branch’s eight-week “Great Decisions” series got off to a good start thanks to special guests
Gary Benjamin and Ansley Damus. Ansley is an asylum seeker from Haiti. He shared the story of his four-year
ordeal seeking asylum in the US, including a two-year stay in Geauga County Jail. Gary, Ansley’s sponsor,
helped tell Ansley’s story and added his own informed perspective on the complicated process. Thirty-two adults
enjoyed this thought-provoking program on the topic of immigration.

Financial Statement Analysis
April 2019

Revenues
For General Property Taxes we received another small distribution in April. The next
couple of months should be smaller amounts that may be distributed until we receive
our next large advance for the second half of the year in June or July. In the
Intergovernmental account we also received our first half of the reimbursement from the
State of Ohio for Homestead Exemptions and Rollbacks. With these distributions we
are on budget for property taxes.
Our April distribution for the PLF was slightly smaller than what we received last year.
We believe the collections moving forward should be slightly larger to bring us back to
budget but, as we do every month, we will monitor this account closely. Last year we
started out the year with smaller distributions than expected and then as the year
progressed, our distributions were larger and made up for some of the smaller
distributions to keep us within budget.
Patron Fines and Fees in total are currently exceeding our estimates. Once again it is
passport fees and photos which are the reason for the increase. Sale of Resale
Supplies is also slightly exceeding our estimates.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
the year.

Expenses
Expenses for Salaries and Benefits are all within budget, with the exception of the
Insurance Benefits and as was mentioned last month all of the HSA accounts were
funded for the year and it will take a couple of months for the budget not to exceed
expenses.
Many of the other expense accounts have higher than expected percentages for
expenses and encumbrances because many of these accounts have standing orders
encumbered against them to pay monthly and recurring expenses.
All other General Fund expense accounts are where we would expect them to be for the
month and the year.
In the Capital Fund projects there are still some funds encumbered for Maple Heights
Branch. This is for some AV work that has been completed, but we are still waiting for
the invoice. After the invoice is paid, we will be closing that project.

 24

Investments
We purchased a US Treasury on April 30, 2019 at a yield of 2.40% with a very short
maturity date (2 weeks) and we also purchased a piece of commercial paper from Bnp
Paribas NY with a yield of 2.58% with a 6-month maturity date.
We also had a CD that matured during the month and reinvested the principal into
another CD with at Wells Fargo Bank with a yield of 2.35% that will mature in a little
over a year.
We have changed our investment strategy within our Money Market funds by keeping a
larger balance in Star Ohio, which is offering a higher rate than what we are receiving at
Key Bank. We just transfer operating funds back from Star Ohio as needed.

Transfers
There were two transfers made for the month: from the Brecksville Special Trust to the
General Fund for $30,406.56 to reimburse the expense of the renovation of meeting
room space at the Brecksville Branch and another transfer from the General Fund to
Special Revenue Fund for $71,400.00 to fund our match for the ASPIRE program.

ALTERNATIVE TAX BUDGET INFORMATION
Political Subdivision/Taxing Unit__Cuyahoga County Public Library _______________________________
For the Fiscal Year Commencing___January 1, 2019__________________________________________
Fiscal Officer Signature____Scott A. Morgan________________________________Date_____May 22, 2

COUNTY OF CUYAHOGA
Background
Substitute House Bill No. 129 (HB129) effective June 3, 2002, was enacted by the 124th General
Assembly in part to allow a county budget commission to waive the requirement that a taxing authority
adopt a tax budget for a political subdivision or other taxing unit, pursuant to Ohio Revised Code (ORC)
Ohio Revised Code Section 5705.281
Under the amended version of this section pursuant to HB 129, a county budget commission, by an
affirmative vote of a majority of the commission, including an affirmative vote by the county auditor, may
waive the tax budget for any subdivision or other taxing unit. However, the commission may require the
taxing authority to provide any information needed by the commission to perform its duties, including the
division of the tax rates as provided under ORC Section 5705.04.
County Budget Commission Duties
The county budget commission must still certify tax rates to each subdivision or other taxing unit, by
March 1 for school districts and by September 1 for all other taxing authorities under ORC Section
5705.35, even when a tax budget is waived. Also, the commission is still required to issue an official
certificate of estimated resources under ORC Section 5705.35 and amended official certificates of
estimated resources under ORC Section 5705 36
Therefore, when a budget commission is setting tax rates based on a taxing unit's need, for purposes of
ORC Sections 5705.32, 5705.34, and 5705.341, its determination must be based on that other
information the commission asked the taxing authority to provide under ORC Section 5705.281, when the
tax budget was waived. Also, an official certificate must be based on that other information the
commission asked the taxing authority to provide.
County Budget Commission Action
On October 11, 2002, during the Cuyahoga County Budget Commission meeting, the commission with
an affirmative vote of all members waived the requirement for taxing authorities of subdivisions or other
taxing units (Including Schools) to adopt a tax budget as provided under ORC Section 5705.281, but

Alternative Tax Budget Information Filing Deadline
For all political subdivisions excluding school districts, the fiscal officer must file one copy of this
document with the County Fiscal Officer on or before July 20th. For school districts the fiscal officer must
file one copy of this document with the County Fiscal Officer on or before January 20th.

GUIDELINES FOR COMPLETING THE
ALTERNATIVE TAX BUDGET INFORMATION
SCHEDULE 1
The general purpose of schedule 1 is to meet the requirement of Ohio Revised Code (ORC) Section
5705.04 which requires the taxing authority of each subdivision to divide the taxes levied into seperate
levies. For help use the schedule B issued by the budget commission for the current year and add any
In column 1 list only those individual funds which are requesting general property tax revenue. In
column 2 purpose refers to the following terms, inside, current expenses, and special levy for example.
In column 4 levy type refers to renewal, additional, and replacement for example. In column 9 identify
the amount of general property tax you wish to request.
NOTE:
The general purpose of column 9 is to demonstrate the need to produce property tax revenues to cover
the estimated expenditures for the budget year. ORC Section 5705.341 states in part;
"Nothing in this section or any section of the ORC shall permit or require the levying of any rate of
taxation, whether within the 10 mill limitation or whether the levy has been approved by the electors, the
political subdivision or the charter of a municipal corporation in excess of such 10 mill limitation, unless
such rate of taxation for the ensuing fiscal year is clearly required by a budget properly and lawfully,
Property tax revenue includes real estate taxes, personal property taxes, homestead and rollback, and

SCHEDULE 2
The general purpose of schedule 2 is to produce an Official Certificate of Estimated Resources for all
In column 3, total estimated receipts should include all revenues plus transfers in excluding property tax
must submit a list of all tax transfers.
SCHEDULE 3
The general purpose of schedule 3 is to provide inside/charter millage for debt service. The basic
security for payment of general obligation debt is the requirement of the levy of ad valorem property
taxes within the 10 mill limitation imposed by Ohio law. Ohio law requires a levy and collection of ad
SCHEDULE 4
The general purpose of schedule 4 is to provide for the proper amount of millage to cover debt service
requirements on voted bond issues. Major capital improvement projects are sometimes financed
through the use of voted bonds. The taxing authority seeks voter approval of general obligation bonds
and of the levy of property taxes outside the indirect debt limitation in whatever amount is necessary to
