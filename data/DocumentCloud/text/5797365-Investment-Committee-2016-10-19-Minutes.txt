OLD/NEW BUSINESS
Trustee Tasha L. Cowan had the following questions regarding Retirement Systems
ITS Contracts:
�

�

Should the annual performance increase/decreases be more detailed?
General Counsel stated that the Joint Personnel committee is addressing this
issue in the charter that they are currently working on. Trustee Cowan states that
there should be consistency across the board regarding contractual employee
contracts.
The contract further states that when terminating employees, it must be
done so by gaining a majority vote by both Boards. When the Board’s
previous IT consultants were terminated, did Police and Fire vote for their
dismissal? The General Board did not vote on this. General Counsel stated
that the contracts that Trustee Cowan was referring to were the expired contracts
for the previous IT (Information Technology) Consultants. The decision not to
renew the contracts was decided by the Joint Personnel Committee. Since the
contracts were expired, no vote by the respective Boards was necessary.

There being no further business before the Board, Chairman Sheehan adjourned the
