IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE JUDGE LOUIS GARIPPO
WHEREAS, Cook County Circuit Judge Louis Garippo, widely respected member of the bar and bench
died on May 31, 2016 at the age at age 84; and
WHEREAS, Judge Garippo attended Fenwick High School, the University of Notre Dame and DePaul
University law school. His father was a 36th Ward Democratic committeeman who held a court
administrator’s post; and
WHEREAS, Judge Louis Garippo will long be remembered for his stellar reputation for wisdom and
fairness. As a judge, he presided over one of the most notorious murder cases in Chicago history; the 1980
trial of John Wayne Gacy, who was convicted of killing 33 men and boys. As a supervisor in the Cook
County state's attorney's office, he helped prosecute Richard Speck for the murder of eight (8) student nurses
in a townhome in Chicago; and
WHEREAS, Judge Louis Garippo enjoyed a lengthy and distinguished legal career. He was genuinely
admired and respected by all of the lawyers in the courtroom, defense attorneys as well as prosecutors. He
was similarly respected and admired by the clerks and staff as well as his fellow members of the bench; and
WHEREAS, during the Gacy trial, Judge Garippo’s equanimity and wisdom guided the crowded courtroom
and the multitudes following the trial through the lengthy and oftentimes disturbing testimony. He not only
maintained the decorum of the courtroom, his conduct and statements upheld the highest ideals in the legal
profession. Many were profoundly moved by Judge Garippo’s speech to the Gacy jurors as he thanked them
for their service. “What we do for the John Wayne Gacys, we do for everyone”; and

Page 14 of 296

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 8, 2016

WHEREAS, Louis Garippo was a judge widely respected for his legal acumen. The trial of John Wayne
Gacy case was closely examined by the media and the legal community. Through all of the years of intense
legal examination and scrutiny Judge Garippo’s decision withstood appeal; despite fourteen years of
appeals, a retrial was never ordered; and
WHEREAS, while a leader at the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, Louis Garippo set the highest
standards for morality and integrity as he helped train the next generation of prosecutors. He was uniformly
regarded as one who respected and took seriously this responsibility. He often instructed the young trainees
that nothing was more important to a lawyer than an impeccable reputation; more than anything else he
taught this ideal by example; and
WHEREAS, as a prosecutor, he handled many high-profile cases in the early 1960s, including that of the
Guido-Yonder gang of torture-burglars, a $250,000 burglary of the Zahn Drug company warehouse and the
Summerdale cops-as-robbers scandal, which led Mayor Richard J. Daley to name an outsider police
superintendent: University of California criminologist O.W. Wilson; and
WHEREAS, after the Gacy trial, Louis Garippo went into private practice. He was later recruited to
research public opinion on whether the University of Illinois should retain Chief Illiniwek as a mascot. He
had to wade through nearly twenty thousand letters on the subject; and
WHEREAS, first and foremost Louis Garippo cherished the title of husband and father. He always put
family as a top priority. He will be sorely missed by his wife, Colette; daughters, Ellen and Mary and his
son, Tom; and a sister, Anna Maria Sciaraffa.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County who he served dutifully, commemorates the extraordinary life
of the Honorable Judge Louis Garippo, and herewith expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable and
innumerable contributions he has made to the Citizens of Cook County, Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be tendered to the family of the
Honorable Judge Louis Garippo.

COMMEMORATING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF
ELLIOT LEHMAN
WHEREAS, Elliot Lehman, pioneering leader in business, philanthropist and advocate for social justice
died at the age of 97 leaving behind family, countless friends and a community enriched for having known
him; and
WHEREAS, Elliot Lehman was born in the Bronx on January 10, 1919. His father, Saul, emigrated from
near Bialystok in present-day Poland at the age of 13, and went into business in New York as a printer. He
graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in New York and graduated from the University of Wisconsin
with a degree in journalism; and
WHEREAS, Elliot Lehman served his country during the Second World War. He served as a lieutenant in
the U.S. Navy, commanding a wooden submarine chaser in the South Pacific theater. Although he never
saw combat, he survived three (3) typhoons; and
WHEREAS, while attending the University of Wisconsin, Elliot Lehman met a Chicagoan named Frances
Mecklenburger and the two (2) married in 1940 and settled in Illinois. Elliot joined the Mecklenburger
family business, the Felt Products Manufacturing Co., later known as Fel-Pro, a manufacturer of gaskets
and sealants. Following his father-in-law’s death in 1961, Elliot served as Fel-Pro’s co-chairman for three
(3) decades, and remained co-chairman emeritus until the company was sold in 1998. He built Fel-Pro
gaskets to a dominant position in supplying both heavy-duty trucks and the automotive aftermarket; and
WHEREAS, Elliot Lehman worked for Fel-Pro for over 50 years, most of them as co-chairman with his
brother-in-law, Lewis Weinberg. Under their leadership, the Skokie based company became not only a
leader in its industry but a widely recognized leader in employee relations, with benefits that included
scholarship programs, on-site day care and summer camp for workers' children. They may have sacrificed
some profit to run their family-friendly company, but they maintained the highest standards in their
products. In 1997, Fel-Pro was named 4th best place to work in Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies
to Work For.” The company was not just a leader in the automotive parts industry, admired by peers and
competitors, they were a national leader in innovative Human Resources practices; and
WHEREAS, Elliot Lehman will long be remembered for his commitment to excellence in business and
particularly in business ethics. He was an early supporter of Business and Professional People for the Public
Interest (BPI), a not-for-profit research, education and social welfare organization with a mission to create
a just society. BPI played a major role in fair housing issues. Fel-Pro pioneered employee inclusion and
rights. Elliot Lehman served BPI Chicago as its second president from 1972 to 1977; and

Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan; and
WHEREAS, Elliot Lehman was a tireless civic leader, dedicated to the communities in which he lived and
worked. He was dedicated to promoting inclusion and justice in the world around him. While he chaired
the board of Business and Professional People for the Public Interest it fought the Gautreaux case to
desegregate and deconcentrate public housing in Chicago. He served as founding president of Project Team,

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE,
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
TO INCLUDE THE VILLAGE OF OAK LAWN IN THE HOME CONSORTIUM
WHEREAS, the County of Cook (the County) is an entitlement community pursuant to the regulations of
the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) at 24 CFR Part 92 and the Community Development
Block Grant Program (CDBG) at 24 CFR Part 570, which entitles the County to receive an annual allocation
of CDBG and HOME grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD);
and
WHEREAS, the amount of HOME funds that the County receives pursuant to entitlement status is
determined by a HUD formula that takes into consideration the populations of the municipalities within its
jurisdiction; and
WHEREAS, the Village of Oak Lawn (the Electing Municipality) within the County that receive
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds directly from HUD can elect to join the County’s
HOME Consortium (the Consortium), which would allow HUD to take into account the populations of the
municipality when calculating the County’s annual HOME funds entitlement grant, thus increasing the
County’s annual allocation; and
WHEREAS, the Electing Municipality is choosing to join the Consortium, as signified by resolution of
their municipal boards; and
WHEREAS, each Electing Municipality must conform to the Consortium Program Year, which runs
October 1 through September 30 in accordance with HUD rules; and

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 8, 2016

WHEREAS, as the Electing Municipality move to the Consortium Program Year they may experience a
gap in their administrative funding for the few months after their old program year expires and before the
Consortium Program Year begins. (i.e., if their current program year ends on June 30th there is a three
month gap before the new program year starts on October 1st); and
WHEREAS, the County wants to maximize its federal allocation of HOME Funds by including the Electing
Municipality in the Consortium. The County’s HOME Investment Partnerships Program could see up to a
$59,000 increase over two years by adding the populations of the Electing Municipality into the formula
for calculating the grant amount; and
WHEREAS, HUD requires that the Cook County Board of Commissioners act by resolution to add the
new entitlement communities into the HOME Consortium.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby agrees
to enter into an Addendum to the HOME Investment Partnerships Program Consortium Agreement for
Federal Fiscal Year 2017 to add the Electing Municipality and that the President, Bureau Chief of Economic
Development or the County Clerk are hereby authorized to execute said HOME Investment Partnerships
Program Consortium Agreement Addendums, Memorandums of Understanding, and any additional
documents necessary to further the aforementioned initiative, and any modifications thereto; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution shall be in full force and effect from and after its
passage and approval as provided by law.

Living Wage Ordinance Compliance Affidavit Provided: Yes
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 8 that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned commercial
facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 8 requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 8 is necessary for development to occur on this specific real
estate. The municipal Resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of abandoned
with special circumstances; and
WHEREAS; commercial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying commercial
real estate eligible for the Class 8 can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the
date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property from
the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 8 will be assessed at 10% of the market
value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the County
of Cook, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the above-captioned property is deemed
abandoned with special circumstances under the Class 8; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to forward a
certified copy of this Resolution to the Office of the Cook County Assessor.

SUPPORTING AMENDMENT 7 TO ILLINOIS HOUSE BILL 1016, THE GUN DEALER AND
AMMUNITION SELLER ACT
WHEREAS, on average 1,000 people die each year from gunshot wounds in our state. The gun death toll
in Illinois in 2013 included 576 homicides and 496 suicides; and
WHEREAS, guns are used in over 70% of all homicides in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the price of one gun homicide costs an average of $441,000.00 in direct costs (including law
enforcement, medical expenses, court costs, and prison), of which 87% is paid by taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, each gun death averages about $6 million in total costs, including both direct and indirect
costs; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 8, 2016

WHEREAS, Chicago police officers recover more than twice the number of crime guns per capita than in
Los Angeles, and more than seven times than in New York City; and
WHEREAS, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) almost all the
guns recovered after being used in crimes were originally sold by retail dealers; and
WHEREAS, corrupt gun dealers represent a major source of illegally trafficked firearms, making oversight
of dealers critical; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) estimates that almost all
guns used in crimes were originally sold by retail dealers; and
WHEREAS, between 2009 and 2013, four (4) particular gun dealers, each located a short drive outside of
Chicago, supplied 20% of all guns recovered from Chicago crime scenes; and
WHEREAS, firearms dealers are subject to very little federal oversight, and on average, are only inspected
once a decade. ATF lacks the resources and authority to monitor the 138,000 gun dealers, manufacturers,
collectors and others that it licenses; and
WHEREAS, lack of oversight makes it far too easy for gun dealers to turn a blind eye to “straw purchasers,”
and other traffickers who fill out the paperwork and undergo background checks in order to provide guns
to criminals or other people ineligible to possess guns; and
WHEREAS, states that do not permit or require law enforcement inspections of gun dealers are the sources
of crime guns recovered in other states at a rate that is 50% greater than states that do, showing that illegal
trafficking of guns could be substantially reduced with better oversight of gun dealers; and
WHEREAS, measures such as law enforcement inspections, background checks for employees, inventory
inspections, video surveillance and improved security, and restrictions on the locations of gun dealers and
ranges, would promote best practices, discourage theft, and thwart illegal sales and straw purchases; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois possess the infrastructure and resources to institute licensing and
regulation of gun dealerships, by requiring them to obtain a state license from the Department of Financial
and Professional Regulation; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois licenses and regulates a wide range of professions to promote public
safety, health and welfare, including for example, acupuncturists, cosmetologists, real estate appraisers and
geologists, but not gun dealers; and
WHEREAS, too many Illinois families have suffered the loss of a loved one and too many innocent people
have been injured or lost their lives as bystanders or victims of gun crimes; and

WHEREAS, Illinois State Senator Don Harmon and Illinois State Representatives Kathleen Willis and
Christian Mitchell have introduced Amendment 7 to House Bill 1016, the Gun Dealer Licensing Act (“the
Act”); and
WHEREAS, the Act provides that it is unlawful for any person engaged in the business of selling, leasing
or otherwise transferring firearms or ammunition without a dealer license issues by the Illinois Department
of Financial and Professional Regulation; and
WHEREAS, the Act requires all applicants for a dealer license and their employees to have a valid Firearm
Owner’s Identification Card and to have background check conducted; and
WHEREAS, the Act prohibits the consumption of alcohol on the premises of any firearm dealer and allows
the Department of State Police to establish rules requiring employees and agents of licenses to undergo
training regarding legal requirements and responsible business practices as applicable to the sale or transfer

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO INSTITUTE
STATEWIDE LICENSING AND REGULATION OF GUN DEALERS AND RANGES
WHEREAS, on average 1,000 people die each year from gunshot wounds in our state. The gun death toll
in Illinois in 2013 included 576 homicides and 496 suicides; and
WHEREAS, guns are used in over 70% of all homicides in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the price of one gun homicide costs an average of $441,000 in direct costs (including law
enforcement, medical expenses, court costs, and prison), of which 87% is paid by taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, each gun death averages about $6 million in total costs, including both direct and indirect
costs; and
WHEREAS, Chicago police officers recover more than twice the number of crime guns per capita than in
Los Angeles, and more than seven times than in New York City; and
WHEREAS, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (“ATF”) almost all the
guns recovered after being used in crimes were originally sold by retail dealers; and
WHEREAS, corrupt gun dealers represent a major source of illegally trafficked firearms, making oversight
of dealers critical; and
WHEREAS, between 2009 and 2013, four particular gun dealers, each located a short drive outside
Chicago, supplied 20% of all guns recovered from Chicago crime scenes. These stores supplied thousands
of crime guns; and
WHEREAS, firearms dealers are subject to very little federal oversight, and on average are inspected only
once a decade, primarily because ATF lacks the resources and authority to monitor the 138,000 gun dealers,
manufacturers, collectors, and others that it licenses; and
WHEREAS, lack of oversight makes it far too easy for gun dealers to turn a blind eye to “straw purchasers,”
and other traffickers who fill out the paperwork and undergo background checks in order to provide guns
to criminals or other people ineligible to possess guns; and
WHEREAS, states that do not permit or require law enforcement inspections of gun dealers are the sources
of crime guns recovered in other states at a rate that is 50% greater than states that do, showing that illegal
trafficking of guns could be substantially reduced with better oversight of gun dealers; and

Page 136 of 296

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 8, 2016

WHEREAS, measures such as law enforcement inspections, background checks for employees, inventory
inspections, video surveillance and improved security, and restrictions on the location of gun dealers and
ranges, would promote best practices, discourage theft, and thwart illegal sales and straw purchases; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois possesses the infrastructure and resources to institute licensing and
regulation of gun dealerships, by requiring them to obtain a state license from the Department of Financial
& Professional Regulation (IDPFR); and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois licenses and regulates a wide range of professions to promote public
safety, health, and welfare, from acupuncturists and cosmetologists to real estate appraisers and professional
geologists, but not gun dealers; and
WHEREAS, too many Illinois families have suffered the loss of a loved one and too many innocent people
have been injured or lost their lives as bystanders or victims of gun crimes.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners hereby petition the Illinois General Assembly to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
the general public in Illinois by requiring firearms dealers and ammunition sellers to obtain a state license
and conduct business responsibly to avoid the diversion of guns into the illegal market; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Clerk notifies the Illinois General Assembly and
the Governor of this request...end

County Tax Reactivation Project or must be located in one of the following designated
geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in
accordance with the provisions of Section 74-65 (b);

2.

An enterprise community as proposed and approved by the County Board on
June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, and the
municipality in which such real estate is located, or, if in an unincorporated area,
the County must by lawful Resolution determine that such real estate is
consistent with an overall plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or

3.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom, Bremen, Calumet, Rich and
Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purpose of Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
not been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have
been vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8
need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the
class change to Class 8. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 8 application,
the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as
the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special
circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class
8 under the TEERM Program, if there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and
other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding
of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes
of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and
present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to
its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A

approved and registered with the United States Department of Labor’s Office of
Apprenticeship, if the contractor or subcontractor employs people in a covered
occupation.

g f.

Class 8 incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program are not renewable.
For all other Class 8 incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as
the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 8.

Sec. 74-70. - Class 8a and 8b designation/assessment class.
(a)

Class 8a. Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or commercial purposes, which real estate
would qualify for a Class 8 designation pursuant to Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for the
fact that the qualifying use of the property prior to application for the incentive does not comply
with the definition of abandoned property provided for in Section 74-62(b), can receive a
designation as a Class 8a property so long as the applicant can show that it has complied with all
of the requirements necessary to receive a Class 8 designation per Sections 74-62 through 74-64,
except for meeting the definition of abandonment provided for in Section 74-62(b), but only when
the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a Resolution or Ordinance in support of such
designation absent abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a Resolution or
Ordinance in support of Class 8a designation absent abandonment when:
a.

An applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from the municipality
in which the real estate is located or the Cook County Board of Commissioners, if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an agreement to abate a portion
of the local government's sales tax generated by the industrial or commercial
enterprise located on such real estate and such abatement of sales tax must cover
the period of time for which the applicant would qualify for this Class 8a incentive;
and

b.

Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that due to national and regional economic conditions beyond its
control the industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a significant
reduction in net operating income of at least 40 percent in the year it makes
application for this incentive as compared to the average net operating income of
the industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

c.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to,
an economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners that the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise is
not economically viable and as such it will cease operations within 60 days of the
submission of an eligibility application for Class 8a designation to the Cook

Page 154 of 296

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 8, 2016

County Assessor, and thereafter the property will become vacant and unused for
an extended period of time of at least 24 months; and

(2)

(3)

d.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to,
an economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners that designation as a Class 8a property will allow the
industrial or commercial enterprise to be economically viable and thereby continue
its operations so that the industrial or commercial enterprise can continue to occupy
and fully utilize the real estate for an extended period of time.

e.

Applicant must provide credible evidence that, at all times after the applicant
receives and maintains a Class 8 designation, if any construction, demolition,
maintenance or repair service is performed at the subject property, then any
contractors and any subcontractors who perform such service must participate in
an active apprenticeship and training program approved and registered with the
United States Department of Labor’s Office of Apprenticeship, if the contractor or
subcontractor employs people in a covered occupation.

Such a Resolution or Ordinance must contain:
a.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that
industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net
operating income of at least 40 percent in the year it makes application for the
incentive as compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or
commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

b.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that Class
8a designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or commercial
enterprise to continue its operations and that without such designation the industrial
or commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property
to become vacant and unused; and

c.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the designation of the property as a Class 8a property absent an
abandonment requirement; and

d.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the application made to the Cook County Assessor requesting
designation as a Class 8a property absent an abandonment requirement.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a
Class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this Section, the municipality in which
the real estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a Resolution or
Ordinance that contains the following:

Page 155 of 296

 Board of Commissioners

(4)

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 8, 2016

a.

A finding by the municipality that it has determined that Class 8a designation of
the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise to
continue its operations and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
become vacant and unused; and

b.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the action by the
Cook County Board of Commissioners to support designation of the property as a
Class 8a property; and

c.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the Class 8a
application to the Cook County Assessor; and

Real estate receiving a Class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall
be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value provided for in Section 74-64(12),
however the term of the incentive will be limited to five years only and such Class 8a
designation shall not be renewed:
a.

After the initial application has been approved and granted, if the subject real estate
receiving the Class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section is sold
or the applicant transfers ownership of any portion of the property at any time prior
to the five-year term of the 8a classification, then the property's Class 8a
classification shall be subject to an eligibility review by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, the municipality, and the Assessor under the procedures set forth
in this Ordinance for the remainder of the five-year term.

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8a designation an eligibility application must
be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation cannot be applied to real estate unless the following has occurred:
application is made to the Cook County Assessor; all required municipal and county
Ordinances and Resolutions are provided to the Cook County Assessor; and the Cook
County Assessor determines that the real estate which is the subject of the application for
a Class 8a designation would qualify for designation as a Class 8 property but for the
inability to comply with the definition of abandonment pursuant to Section 74-62(b).

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this Section to determine
eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a Class 8a designation, the Cook County
Assessor shall forward such application and any supporting documentation provided with
such application to the Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee for
consideration as to whether the County Board will provide a Resolution or Ordinance in
support of a Class 8a designation absent abandonment.

this Section that may be needed to ensure proper review of information, data and documents
submitted in support of a request to the County Board for a Resolution or Ordinance in
support of a Class 8a designation as provided for in this Section.

(11)

Applicants for a Class 8a designation of property can only make such an application for the
following assessment years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and the Cook County
Assessor shall not designate any real estate as Class 8a property for assessment year 2018
or thereafter.

(12)

Real estate that receives a designation as a Class 8a incentive property will lose such
designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment, if the industrial or
commercial enterprise located on the property ceases operations and the subject real estate
becomes vacant and unused.

(13)

Real estate that receives a designation as a Class 8a incentive property will lose such
designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment upon termination of the
required partial sales tax abatement by local government.

(14)

passage.

Class 8b. Real estate and improvements that house inpatient and outpatient hospital based services,
where the property has been acquired for hospital use by a for-profit acquirer unrelated to the notfor-profit disposer, thereby avoiding Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board
discontinuation approval, shall be considered for a Class 8b designation if it meets the requirements
of this Section and the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a Resolution or Ordinance
in support of such designation.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a Resolution or
Ordinance in support of Class 8b designation when:
a.

The applicant is a hospital, as defined in the Hospital Licensing Act, or an entity
that owns the real property on which a hospital is located, the hospital is licensed
by the state, and the abandonment of the hospital would require the applicant, or
the hospital on behalf of which the applicant owns the real property on which the
hospital is located, to obtain a permit or exemption from the State of Illinois Health
Facilities and Services Review Board pursuant to the Illinois Health Facilities
Planning Act prior to discontinuing hospital operations and to obtain a second

permit or exemption prior to reopening or otherwise reestablishing the hospital
after abandonment;

(2)

(3)

b.

approval of the Class 8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that the
property will be retained for hospital use with the associated employment benefits
relative to industrial or commercial use of the property;

c.

The subject hospital is located in a zip code which has a ten-percent or greater
incidence of families and/or individuals below the poverty level, as identified by
the U.S. Census Bureau's most recent census; and

d.

equivalent jobs being defined as total hours worked by all non-full-time employees
divided by average annual hours worked by the full-time employees).

e.

Applicant must provide credible evidence that, at all times after the applicant
receives and maintains a Class 8 designation, if any construction, demolition,
maintenance or repair service is performed at the subject property, then any
contractors and any subcontractors who perform such service must participate in
an active apprenticeship and training program approved and registered with the
United States Department of Labor’s Office of Apprenticeship, if the contractor or
subcontractor employs people in a covered occupation.

Such a Resolution or Ordinance must contain:
a.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the
applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that
approval of the Class 8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that the
property will be retained for hospital use; and

b.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the designation of the property as a Class 8b property.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a
Class 8b property is sought using the provisions of this Section, the municipality in which
the real estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:
a.

A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that the proposed
redevelopment contemplated for the subject hospital or the property on which the
hospital sits is necessary and appropriate and that, without a classification having
the impact of this Section, the special circumstances that exist on the property on
which the subject hospital sits including, but not limited to, the unique requirement
that mandates that the subject hospital's operations are continually maintained

Page 158 of 296

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 8, 2016

without interruption in order for the State of Illinois Health Facilities and Services
Review Board to issue a certificate of need and licensure approval for the continued
operation of the subject hospital and the extraordinary need for the continued
operation of the subject hospital within the applicable region, will not be addressed
and the property on which the subject hospital sits will become vacant and
underutilized and cause the continued exasperation of blighted factors within the
municipality and region;
b.

A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that a classification
having the impact of this Section is necessary for the redevelopment to occur on
the property on which the subject hospital sits; and

c.

A statement by the corporate authorities of the municipality supporting and
consenting to the filing of an application for a classification having the impact of
this Section for the property on which the subject hospital sits.

(4)

Real estate receiving a Class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall
be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value and for the term provided for in
Section 74-64(12).

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8b designation, a Class 8 or Class 8b application
must be made or have been made to the Cook County Assessor. Any application for Class
8 submitted with required municipal approval after July 1, 2008, for hospital property
where the property was acquired for hospital use by an unrelated for-profit acquirer,
avoiding the Health Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation approval, shall
be reconsidered as an application pursuant to this Section upon supplement of such Class
8 application with the additional information required in this Section, if any. Upon receipt
of an application, the Cook County Assessor shall forward such application and any
supporting documentation provided with the application to the Cook County Board of
Commissioners for consideration as to whether the Cook County Board will provide a
resolution or ordinance in support of a Class 8b designation. Real estate receiving a Class
8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be eligible for such
designation beginning in the assessment year during which an application for the
classification having the impact of this Section is made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8b designation cannot be applied to real estate unless the following has occurred:
application is made or has been made to the Cook County Assessor, and all required
municipal and county Ordinances and Resolutions are provided to the Cook County
Assessor.

Property Description: The Subject Property consists of approximately 5.9 acres and generally located on
the southeast corner of Wolf Road and 171st Street, in Section 29, in unincorporated Orland Township.

Recommendation: ZBA Recommendation is of Approval with Conditions.

Conditions:
1. Limit the proposed use at the existing building at the current size.
2. Limit the repair work to Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM.
3. The service work within the facility shall be limited to minor maintenance, such as fluid changes, tire
changes, tune-ups, and replacement of lights, batteries, belts and windshield wipers; and no body work,
painting, brake testing, or engine rebuilding shall be performed within the facility. No heavy mechanical
work.
4. No outside contractors, only employees are to be used on site for repair work.
5. Only school buses and passenger vehicles be parked on the Subject Property. No tractor trailers are to

6. No more than two 2500 lbs. tanks are to be used for storage on the Subject Property.

Sec. 106-2 of the Floodplains Ordinance, “Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)” is defined as “the elevation
of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood plus two feet of freeboard….” Hence, the provision would
address concern that fuel containers be situated well above flood level so their contents will not be released
into flood waters and damage other property.

Sec. 34-261. - Preface and Findings.
(a) The County has heretofore adopted a Minority and Woman-Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance to
ensure that local small businesses owned by economically disadvantaged minorities y and women's
businesses are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in Contracts.
(b) The Supreme Court of the United States in City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469 (1989), has
enunciated certain standards which are necessary to maintain effective affirmative action programs in
compliance with constitutional requirements.
(c) The County continues to be is committed to implementing an its affirmative action program associated
with local small businesses owned by economically disadvantaged minorities and women in conformance
with the United States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson and other relevant law.
(d) In furtherance of this commitment, and at the direction of the Board and the President of the Board,
supported by County staff , professionals, and consultants, conducted an investigation to determine whether
and to what degree (1) there continues to be into the scope of any discrimination in County Procurements,
and in the award of and participation in contracts in the metropolitan County Chicago economy; , the extent
to which (2) such discrimination or the effects thereof has denied and continues to deny small and
economically disadvantaged minority and women's business enterprises equal opportunity to participate in
such Procurements and contracts; (3) small businesses owned and managed by economically disadvantaged
minorities and women in the County Marketplace experience disparate negative impacts in terms of
participating in public and private transactions, including but not limited to transactions with the County,
those private enterprises with whom it does business, and other private enterprises; (4) small, economically
disadvantaged businesses owned and managed by minorities and women in the County Marketplace
experience reduced earnings; (5) the formation of businesses owned and managed by minorities and women
in the County Marketplace is disproportionately low; (6) there continues to be a chronic lack of wealth,
business loans, and financial liquidity among the County’s minority communities and among minorities
who own and operate their own small businesses; (7) the disproportionate levels of poverty among
minorities in the County and any of the foregoing elements detrimentally affect the County’s efforts to
protect and promote public safety, health and welfare, and to identify the appropriate affirmative action
steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination, obstacles, and poverty and its their continuing effects.
(e) Minority, and women, and other small businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and
subcontracts in dollar amounts that are disproportionately lower than the availability of such businesses
willing and able to perform Contracts.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

(f) The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above identified underutilization
of Minorityminority, and women, and other small businesses on contracts and subcontractsContracts.
(g) Minority, and women's, and other small businesses continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory
practices in the local construction industry and economy when competing for contracts Contracts and in
seeking subcontracting opportunities on such contractsContracts.
(h) The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses which discriminate
against minority, women businesses by entering into contracts with such discriminating businesses.
(i) Despite the County’s its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action programs,
minority, and women, and other small businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in competing for
Ccontracts and subcontracts.
(j) Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without numerical goals have not and
are not likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority, and women, and other small businesses
in participating in Ccontracts due to discrimination in the local economy.
(k) The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in Contracts are
commensurate with the availability of minority and women's businesses willing and able to perform County
work.
(l) The reduction of such discrimination in the local economy will help reduce the disproportionate levels
of poverty among minorities in the County and positively affect the County’s efforts to protect and promote
public safety, health, and welfare.

Based on the foregoing findings, the policy and purpose of this division are as follows:

procurement process as both prime contractors and subcontractors.
(b) The County is committed to a policy of preventing and reducing discrimination in making Procurements,
and eliminating arbitrary barriers to participation in Procurements by all persons, regardless of race, sex, or
ethnicity.
(c) To offset the effects of negative disparate impacts on small businesses owned and managed by
economically disadvantaged minorities and women with respect to public and private transactions; reduced
earnings among County-based small businesses owned by minorities and women; reduced business
formation among County-based minorities and women; a chronic lack of wealth and financial liquidity

(l) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the County. The
challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be maintained.
(m) PCEs shall submit to the CCD complete and accurate material information, and shall not submit to the
CCD false, deceptive, fraudulent, or inaccurate material information, relative to (1) its status as a PCE; (2)

(2) The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid or /proposal is due. In the event a bid or proposal
leads to a Contract with the County, the Utilization Plan as approved by the CCD shall be incorporated as
a material commitment as between the contractor and all relevant PCEs and the contractor and the County.
Failure to include a Utilization Plan shall will render the bid or proposal submission not Responsive.
(3) The CCD shall review and either approve or reject the Utilization Plan. For purposes of evaluation

(3) A PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of PCE
participation.
(4) When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified PCE and
the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may present evidence to rebut this
presumption.

below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, may not cannot be utilized
duplicatively as both an MBE and a WBEon the same Contract.
(1) PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the achievement of
the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the other goals by another method
described herein. If a PCE is certified as a WBE and is also a MBE, such PCE’s WBE's participation may
count toward either the MBE or WBE Goalbut not both.
(2) Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with
one or
more PCEs, the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement containing at least the information set
forth in this Subsection34-384(ii)1 through 4 [(2)a. through d.] below. The CCD shall consider the
following in determining whether the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the Program Goals based upon
such written Joint Venture agreement and the Utilization Plan.
a. Each Joint Venture partner's initial capital investment;
b. The extent to which the each PCE's’ proposed participation in the performance of the Contract
constitutes a Commercially Useful Function;
c. Whether the relevant PCE's shares in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is proportional to their
ownership interest;
d. Whether the relevant PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control and risk with
respect to the Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;
(3) Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of subcontracting with,
or purchasing from one or more PCEs.
Sec. 34-271. - Request for a total or partial waiver; good faith efforts.
(a) Parties submitting bids or proposals for Procurements may in all instances request a partial or full waiver
of one or more established contract-specific Goal for PCE participation. In reviewing a request for a partial
or total request for waiver of a Contract Specific Goal, the CCD shall determine whether a Person has made
good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver request should be granted. In
determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will consider whether the Person has
taken the following actions:
(1) Reviewed lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments and agencies
to identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;
(2) Divided Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where appropriate,
breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent with the availability of PCEs,
Page 253 of 296

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work
items with its own forces;
(3) Adjusted any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise assist PCEs in
obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to encourage participation by PCEs;
(4) Make Made timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods or
services required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely opportunity to obtain
and review all information concerning the Procurement necessary to enable such PCE to respond;
(5) Followed up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the Procurement;
(6) Negotiated in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in the
Procurement. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of PCEs
that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the
work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached. The Contractor may not reject
PCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons. That there may be some additional costs involved in
finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Goals, as long
as such costs are reasonable;
(7) Make Made efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or
related assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such efforts shall not be
inconsistent with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for actually obtaining and paying for such
items;
(8) Established delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the requirements of
the Procurement permit;
(9) Used the services and assistance of the CCD's staff, the Small Business Administration, the Office of

identified as assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement;
(11) Maintains or commits to establish and maintain a mentor-protégé agreement with one or more PCEs
that is enforceable and that, in the judgment of the CCD, has performance standards and outcomes that are
clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the PCE in acquiring additional skills, experience, and
relationships helpful to the long-term success of the PCE, consistent with the provisions of Section 34271(d). Demonstrate to the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protege relationship could be
established, as described in Section 34-271.

by PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same Procurement may be
Page 254 of 296

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 8, 2016

considered. For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to meet the Contract Specific
Goals, but meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Bidders or Respondents, this
may be evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made Good Faith Efforts.
(c) Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those
professionals whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1) A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, "good faith" efforts
shall be demonstrated as set forth in Section 34-271; provided, however, that such Persons shall not be
required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors would not typically be utilized for the type
of Procurement. In such cases, the Person shall document the reasons for not subcontracting in a waiver
request.
(2) The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or services for
such Contractor's business operations not specifically for the Procurement.
(3) If such Person is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan and goals shall
be submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such plan and goals with the Person's
actual affirmative action achievements and such achievements may be considered by the County in future
Procurements.
(d) Mentor/protégé agreements. Where a Contractor enters into or maintains a mentor/protege agreement
with a PCE to improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the
effect of such agreement as a factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protégé agreement may
provide for the Contractor to assist the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE's business,
improving financial management, or providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the
mentor/protégé agreement shall satisfy the following requirements.
(1) The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;
(2) The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and
(3) The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor and the PCE and includes
specific, measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the performance of the agreement. In order
to be a factor in establishing best efforts, the mentor/protégé agreement must be for a reasonable period of
time.
(e) The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:
(1) There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods or services required
for the Procurement;
(2) The Procurement cannot reasonably be divided;
Page 255 of 296

 Board of Commissioners

(g) If, for reasons associated with malfeasance, fraud, or other factors set forth in Section 34-268(m), a
PCE ceases to be certified during its performance on a Procurement, the dollar value of work performed
under a Contract with that PCE Person after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted. If for other
factors not associated with malfeasance, fraud, or other factors set forth in Section 34-268(m), a PCE ceases

Contract with that PCE Person after it has ceased to be certified shall be counted for the remaining term of
the Contract.

a
Utilization Plan and has failed to provide a cure accepted by the CCD in his or her discretion, the CCD
shall notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor or PCE,
or both, and the Contractor and PCE shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract.
If no such period is provided, the Contractor or PCE, as the case may be, shall have ten days to cure such
default. For purposes of this section, providing a plan for bringing the Contract into compliance with the
Utilization Plan may constitute a cure, if compliance cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable
cure period, and if compliance is achieved in accordance with such plan.
(2) If a Contractor or PCE fails to provide any documentation required by the CCD, the CCD shall notify
the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to

Page 268 of 296

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

June 8, 2016

the bid/proposal is due. In the event a bid or proposal leads to a Contract with the County, the Utilization
Plan as approved by the CCD shall be incorporated as a material commitment as between the contractor
and all relevant PCEs, the contractor and the County. Failure to include a Utilization Plan shall render the
bid or proposal not Responsive.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that the
MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CCD will determine whether the
Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). Parties submitting bids or proposals for

whether the Contractor's efforts to has:
(1) Solicited through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings, advertising
and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The
Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation.
The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Selected portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the likelihood
that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract
work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's
responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of
the work or material needs consistent with the availability of MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.
(3) Negotiated in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation includes the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a description of the
information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and
why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and
WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities.
That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself
sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are
reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own organization
does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that could be
subcontracted.
(4) Makde efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance
as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.

(6) Used the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored minority/women business
assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and
placement of MBEs and WBEs.

clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the PCE in acquiring additional skills, experience, and
relationships helpful to the long-term success of the PCE consistent with the provisions of Section 34271(d).
***
Sec. 34-298. - Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project Specific Goals
become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the contract,
and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to the County
or as otherwise directed by the County. The CCD and the User Department shall monitor subcontractor
participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the
Contractor's books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns and records and
books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE

shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's
records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named in the
Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CCD, in consultation with the Purchasing Agent
CPO and the User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision
and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination
of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract
penalties or other sanctions. Upon such written approval by the CCD, the revised Utilization Plan shall be
incorporated into the Contract by the CPO. The CCD shall promulgate policies and procedures with respect

URGING THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES
OF ILLINOIS STATE GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE PAYMENTS
FOR CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTHCARE
AND FAMILY SERVICES AND VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
FOR SERVICES RENDERED FOR CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT
WHEREAS, for many years the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services [“HFS”] has
contracted with The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit
Court of Cook County, the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County and the Cook County Sheriff [“Local
Offices”] to assist HFS in meeting its child support enforcement obligations under state and federal law,
including federal consent decrees; and
WHEREAS, the services provided by the Local Offices for HFS include establishing and insuring that
orders of child support and parentage are entered, modified and enforced against non-custodial parents,
including criminal prosecutions for delinquent payments; litigation; obtaining support and arrearage orders;
performance of summonses and body attachments; expedited treatment of support cases; and prompt
processing and reporting of support orders. All of these services are to the primary benefit of our most
vulnerable citizens, our children, and if not performed in a timely manner would have a very detrimental
effect on the children’s well-being for extended periods of time; and

WHEREAS, Cook County, based on HFS’ commitment to pay the Local Offices pursuant to their contract,
budgeted $18,594,125.00 for the Local Offices’ HFS support function for the current budget year [2016],
with the understanding that this amount would be reimbursed by HFS [a portion of which is paid by State
monies and the remainder paid by Federal monies]; and
WHEREAS, HFS has made no reimbursement to the Local Offices since July 1, 2015 and further if HFS
does not pay the State portion of amounts due [approximately $6M] for the contracts expiring on June 30,
2016, Cook County will permanently lose the Federal portion [approximately $12M] of monies due; and
WHEREAS, due to the fact that HFS has not reimbursed the Local Offices as anticipated, the County now
faces an $18 million shortfall in its budget.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that we
strongly urge the Legislative and Executive Branches of Illinois State Government to work together to
insure payment for contracts between HFS and the Local Office for the present budget year prior to June
