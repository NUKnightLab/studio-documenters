SPECIAL BUSINESS MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

NEW BUSINESS
Mr. Gingo said that the Board would consider one item of new business. He then made the
following statement:

 17 April 2019 Special Board Meeting Minutes – Page 2

“As you will recall, in October 2016, in a special meeting of the Board of Trustees, the Board
appointed Dr. Rex Ramsier as Senior Vice President and Provost, effective through June 30, 2018.
At that time, the Board also stated that it would begin a search for the Senior Vice President and
Provost position subsequent to its decision concerning whether it would begin a search for a new
President.
In December 2017, as part of a plan to enhance the University’s administrative structure, the Board
created the positions of Executive Vice President/Chief Administrative Officer and Executive Vice
President/Chief Academic Officer. At that time, the Board named Dr. Ramsier as Executive Vice
President/Chief Administrative Officer and asked Dr. Ramsier to continue to serve as the Senior
Vice President and Provost until a candidate was selected to fill that position.
The search for the Executive Vice President/Chief Academic Officer began in early 2018.
However, because of subsequent transition in the Presidency, the search was temporarily
suspended in spring of 2018. Now that the University’s national search for a new President is well
underway, it is time to address the position of Executive Vice President/Chief Academic Officer.
Dr. Ramsier has done a remarkable job filling the role of Senior Vice President and Provost, while
also serving as Executive Vice President/Chief Administrative Officer, and the Board highly
values the working relationship and positive results that have been achieved thus far by him and
Dr. Green. Dr. Ramsier has been invaluable in his work with the Higher Learning Commission,
and his data-driven contributions during Academic Program Review were critical to moving that
process forward.
For almost three years, Dr. Ramsier has been serving in multiple roles for the University, but now
the Board wishes for Dr. Ramsier to focus all of his energies on the Chief Administrative Officer
position and to relieve him of the responsibilities of serving in two different vice president
positions.
Accordingly, today the Board will take several actions to continue the positive momentum begun
through the work of Dr. Ramsier and Dr. Green over the last year:
1.

The Board extends the contract of Dr. Ramsier, as Executive Vice President/Chief
Administrative Officer, by one year to June 30, 2021; and

2.

The Board discontinues the title of Senior Vice President and Provost; and

3.

The Board appoints Dr. Chand Midha as the Interim Executive Vice President/Chief
Academic Officer. Dr. Midha also will continue to serve as Executive Dean of the
Graduate School; and

4.

The Board will engage a search firm to conduct a national search for the Position of
Executive Vice President/Chief Academic Officer. This search will be coordinated with
the ongoing presidential search and will be conducted in accordance with the Collective

 17 April 2019 Special Board Meeting Minutes – Page 3

Bargaining Agreement between the University and the Akron-AAUP. Neither Dr. Midha
nor Dr. Ramsier will be candidates for the position of Executive Vice President/Chief
Academic Officer.
As Interim Executive Vice President/Chief Academic Officer, Dr. Midha will be responsible for
leading the academic mission of the University. Dr. Midha will have management responsibility
for coordinating the academic offerings of the University’s academic units and will play a critical
role in the selection of academic leadership and in the process for promotion and tenure. Dr.
Midha’s duties also will include oversight of the Office of Institutional Research and the Office of
Research Administration, as well as serving as the primary administrative liaison to the Faculty
Senate and the University Council.
As Executive Vice President/Chief Administrative Office, Dr. Ramsier will continue to have
oversight responsibility for enrollment management and student services, human resources and
labor relations, and accreditation compliance and reporting. Since Dr. Midha now will oversee
Institutional Research, Dr. Ramsier also will supervise the administrative portion of action
planning and budget development, as well as assisting with University rule and policy compliance.
The details for each position are more fully detailed in the resolution.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Dr. Ramsier again for serving in dual capacities and
for Dr. Midha agreeing to assume the position as Interim Executive Vice President/Chief
Academic Officer. We look forward to continuing to work with Dr. Ramsier and with Dr. Midha
in their respective roles.”

REPORT OF THE CHAIR
Strategic Plan
Mr. Gingo made the following statement:
“This Board has emphasized the critical need for the University to achieve sustainable financial
stability within the next three to five years. The Board has asked the president and the
administration, in conjunction with the entire University community, to develop a Strategic Plan
to achieve this goal. As work on the Strategic Plan commences, this Board wants to emphasize
the need for the plan to include areas of targeted academic emphasis and investment, as well as
measures to ensure institutional financial prudence and accountability. Essential components for
the success of the plan include:
•

Installing stable and committed University leadership, including the president, executive vice
president/chief academic officer and college deans;

•

Attracting, retaining and graduating students into productive careers;

•

Increasing the perception of The University of Akron as a university of distinction and
choice;

•

Focusing research in areas of strength and opportunity;

•

Working closely with regional business, community and political leaders to strengthen our
local economy;

•

Effectively managing expenses; and

•

Significantly increasing donations, including donations for student scholarships and endowed
chairs.
In fact, a little later today we will honor the personal generosity of our colleague Tony
Alexander. Tony’s donation toward the College of Business Administration’s renovation and
expansion campaign is just one example of the type of impactful contribution that will
provide greater opportunities and resources for future students in the College.

The Board believes that the development and successful implementation of a Strategic Plan that
includes these elements will increase the success of the University’s graduates and the perception
of The University of Akron as a university of distinction and choice.”
Presentation by the Ohio Ethics Commission
Mr. Gingo reported that on April 30 he had attended a presentation on campus about Ohio’s
Ethics Laws given by Susan Willeke of the Ohio Ethics Commission. He described the

 12 June 2019 Board Minutes – Page 3
presentation as informative, practical and dynamic. He acknowledged with appreciation also the
attendance of Dr. Green, several members of the Cabinet, and many employees from a wide
cross section of colleges and departments.
Mr. Gingo stated that, “at The University of Akron, we strive to adhere to the highest ethical
standards in our business dealings, employment practices and overall operation, and talks like
this one are a good reminder of how we should behave. Thank you to Celeste Cook and the
Office of General Counsel for arranging this presentation.”
Spring 2019 Commencement
Mr. Gingo reported that he had enjoyed participating in the stage party for the six regular spring
commencement ceremonies over the weekend of May 10-12 and for the School of Law
commencement on Sunday, May 19. He described the proud and joyous reactions of the
graduates to having achieved their respective academic milestones as truly gratifying, and
acknowledged one such point of pride in particular, Student Trustee Joshua E. J. Thomas, who
received a Master of Science in Civil Engineering degree.
Mr. Gingo praised the men and women who had organized and conducted those ceremonies for
providing such an excellent experience to the graduates and their families. He cited that, in a
recent survey of students, the University’s multiple commencement ceremonies had been
overwhelmingly favored over a proposed single large ceremony at InfoCision Stadium. “It is no
wonder that our students want to keep it this way as they appeared to enjoy it 100 percent,” he
stated.
Mr. Gingo reiterated his congratulations on behalf of the Board to each 2019 graduate of The
University of Akron, and he thanked the individuals whose work and time had facilitated those
ceremonies.
Conclusion
Mr. Gingo offered the following acknowledgements:
“As the 2018-2019 fiscal year winds down, I wish to express, as Chair of this Board, my
personal thanks to each Trustee for your individual contributions over the past year. Colleagues,
our commitment and support are vital to the success of The University of Akron, and are most
appreciated.
To each administrator, faculty member, contract professional and staff member, I am profoundly
aware that your individual and collective efforts in challenging circumstances have been key to
maintaining the integrity of this institution. Please know that you have my deepest gratitude.”
REPORT OF THE INTERIM PRESIDENT (See Appendix D.)

 12 June 2019 Board Minutes – Page 4
REPORT OF THE STUDENT TRUSTEES
Mr. Thomas introduced University of Akron doctoral candidate Samantha Pfeiffer, who offered
remarks to the Board regarding her University of Akron experience (see Appendix E). She
received a commemorative gift from Trustees.
Mr. Adolph reported on student activities as spring transitions to summer:
•

Students had celebrated the end of spring semester on May 3 at the tenth-annual SpringFest.
The campus event featured local music talent, food trucks, a zip line, a petting zoo, and a
beer garden featuring local craft beer offerings.

•

The beginning of summer and a quieter campus meant that many students were away
working internships and co-ops, taking courses, doing research, and studying abroad, thereby
impacting their local communities and society as a whole.

•

One such activity, the “Zips in the Valley” program sponsored by the College of Business
Administration’s Institute for Leadership Advancement, had facilitated a cohort of 25
University of Akron students from various disciplines such as business, art and biomimicry
to travel to California’s Silicon Valley. The five-day trip from May 28 to June 1 had
included visits to companies like Tesla and Google as well as NASA, Stanford University,
and famous locations in the San Francisco Bay area. Students also met with Akron alumni
who work in Silicon Valley.
ACTION ITEMS

Mr. Gingo said that, because the Board uses a consent agenda, it would hear reports for each committee
and wait to hold one vote for all actions on the consent agenda. The Board would vote on actions not
listed on the consent agenda immediately after those items are raised. All of the action and
informational items in the Board materials had been discussed in detail during committee meetings held
on June 7.
CONSIDERATION OF MINUTES (“Board of Trustees” Tab)

WHEREAS, The Board agrees with the ideals expressed in the Resolution; Now, Therefore,

“Because the University of Akron is committed to free and open inquiry in all matters, it

listen, challenge, and learn. Except insofar as limitations on that freedom are necessary to the
functioning of the University, the University of Akron fully respects and supports the freedom of
all members of the University community to discuss any problem that presents itself.
Of course, the ideas of different members of the collegiate community will often and quite
naturally conflict. But it is not the proper role of the University to attempt to shield individuals
from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive. Although
the University greatly values civility, and although all members of the University community share
in the responsibility for maintaining a climate of mutual respect, concerns about civility and
mutual respect can never be used as a justification for closing off discussion of ideas, however
offensive or disagreeable those ideas may be to some members of our community.
The University of Akron may restrict expression that: violates the law, falsely defames a specific
individual, constitutes a genuine threat or harassment, unjustifiably invades substantial privacy or
confidentiality interests, or is otherwise directly incompatible with the University’s functioning.
The University of Akron should retain the commensurate right to regulate reasonably the time,
place, and manner of expression to ensure that it does not disrupt any ordinary university activities.
But these regulations and exceptions cannot ever compromise the institution’s commitment to a
completely free and open discussion of ideas.
As a corollary to the University of Akron’s commitment to protect and promote free expression,
communities associated with the University of Akron must also act in conformity with the
principle of free expression. Although members of the University community are free to criticize
and contest the views expressed on campuses, and to criticize and contest speakers who are invited

APPENDIX B: RESOLUTIONS, Page 7
to express their views on campuses, they may not obstruct or otherwise interfere with the freedom
of others to express views they reject or even loathe. To this end, universities have a solemn
responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also
to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.”

APPENDIX D: REPORT OF THE INTERIM PRESIDENT
Budget
During the past academic year, all University units participated in the development of a
comprehensive and inclusive Three-Year Action Plan. This was the first step toward developing a
long-range strategic plan. The plan is intended to align University resources with our priorities,
especially the top priorities of Increasing Success of Our Students, and Emphasizing Academic
Distinctiveness.
It was understood from the beginning of the planning process that the action plan would be used to
guide the preparation of the 2019-2020 University Budget. Today I am pleased to report that we
achieved this goal, with the active involvement and cooperation of the deans and vice presidents,
and in consultation with the University Council.
Later this morning, Chief Financial Officer Nathan Mortimer will give a presentation on this
budget. In all candor, this is a challenging budget characterized by tough choices. As promised,
all elements of the University participated in these tough decisions. This budget takes a large step
toward stable and sustainable university finances.
As part of this plan, we will continue to invest in key faculty positions, and conduct dean searches
to solidify the leadership in our colleges of business, education and health professions.
As this Board considers the adoption of the budget proposals, I would remind everyone that this is
a continuing process, an annual exercise of shared governance, assessment and priority setting.
This fall we will continue this shared governance process, as we collectively and collaboratively
revise the action plan to maintain its alignment with the priorities of the institution.
This budget that is being considered today is a point on a continuum. The Action Plan informed
our budget decisions, and the budget will produce results that enable us to further refine the action
plan. This continuing process will enable us to focus plans, adjust to changes in circumstances,
and move our institution ahead in the years to come.
Free Speech Resolution
At this time I want to congratulate the Faculty Senate, University Council and this Board on
supporting a resolution affirming the policy statement of the Committee for Freedom of
Expression at the University of Chicago. This model has been adopted by universities around the
country to affirm free speech and academic freedom.
There are two aspects of this topic that I would like to highlight.
The first is that this is a faculty-initiated action that demonstrates our strong support for the
constitutional right to free speech, and for our institutional culture and policy of academic
freedom.
The second point is more subtle, but equally important.

 12 June 2019 Board Minutes – Appendices

APPENDIX D: REPORT OF THE INTERIM PRESIDENT, Page 2
Some wonder if this action is necessary since our campus has not experienced the kind of
challenges to free speech or academic freedom that have occurred at other places across the
country.
I believe the comparative calm on our campus speaks highly of the character of University of
Akron students, faculty and staff. Many of them, I assure you, are passionate in their beliefs
concerning politics, social justice and related issues. But they also seem grounded in an
understanding and appreciation of the importance of free speech for all.
I am grateful and proud to be associated with students and colleagues who are so committed to this
great principle that they ensured its preservation on our campus with the promotion and passage of
this resolution.
Career Placement
An interesting statistic has come to light that I would like to share with you.
Graduation rates are often cited as a measure of a University’s effectiveness. But, an equally and
perhaps far more practical measure is what happens to our graduates after they pack away their
caps and gowns. According to surveys conducted by the Office of Career Services, 92 percent of
our 2018 graduates found employment or continued their education within six months of
graduation.
Let me repeat that figure: 92 percent. That is better than nine out of ten of our graduates being
employed or continuing their education six months after graduation. That is a three-percentagepoint increase over the previous year. It also is well above the national rate of 81 percent job
placement six months after graduation.
These statistics, perhaps more than any other, are a fine testament to the quality of our graduates,
and the education delivered by our faculty.
Residence Life Award
I also want to share my congratulations to Dr. John Messina and his colleagues in the Office of
Student Affairs, and the student leaders who work in residential life.
The University of Akron was named the 2019 National School of the Year by the National
Association of College and University Residence Halls at its national conference last month. This
is the third time that The University of Akron has won this honor, with previous accolades coming
in 2000 and 1992. The award recognizes outstanding campus achievements by a residence hall
organization and its affiliate groups, as well as contributions on a regional and national level to the
organization. Other national nominees were Columbia University, New York University and
North Carolina State. To be listed among such company is an honor in itself, and to be chosen as
the best among them is indeed a great achievement.

Ohio Highway Patrol
I, along with Board Chair Gingo and Trustee Adkins, had the pleasure of being part of yesterday’s
welcoming ceremony for the Ohio State Highway Patrol post on our campus, located on Fir Hill
Drive. It was wonderful to have Thomas Stickrath, the director of the Ohio Department of Public
Safety, OSHP Colonel Richard Fambro and Summit County Executive Ilene Shapiro at the
ceremony as well.
Having the Highway Patrol located in a building on our campus is unique in the State of Ohio, and
the partnership provides benefits to the campus, the city and the county in terms of safety and
protection for the entire community. Special thanks to Nathan Mortimer for his leadership in
coordinating this valuable arrangement.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I would like to invite Ms. Heather Pollock, our education abroad
coordinator, to come forward and give a presentation on the University’s study abroad program.

 Guide to Terminology Used in Personnel Reports

Term

Definition/Explanation

Adjunct Appointment

Appointment to a full-time or part-time position, normally without pay.
Individuals in this category are affiliated with the University for a
specific purpose usually involving academic research/teaching.
Appointment provides the individual with access to University
systems/services as determined by the department/college.

Appointment

New hire of an individual to an approved Faculty, Contract Professional
or Staff position. The appointment can be full-time or part-time,
temporary or regular.

Department/School Chair

Faculty member appointed to provide leadership to an academic
department or school within a college. Department/School Chair
appointments normally cover the entire academic year (12-month
appointment). A Faculty member’s salary will be converted from 9month to 12-month status using an approved formula to reflect the
additional time worked. A stipend (currently calculated as 1/11th of the
converted salary) is awarded for assuming the additional responsibilities
of a Department/School Chair. 1/10th of the stipend is converted to
base each year that the individual serves as a Department/School Chair.

Discharge

Involuntary termination of appointment.

Job Audit/Reclassification

Under University Rule 3359-25-10 the University may initiate audits and
reviews of positions and classifications within the approved University
Classified (3359-25-06) and Unclassified (3359-25-07) classification
plans. In addition, employees may submit a request to determine if
their current position is appropriately classified. The employee submits
a Position Description Audit Questionnaire (PDAQ) to their immediate
supervisor to initiate the job audit process. The immediate supervisor
and second level supervisor are required to review and approve the
information submitted on the PDAQ. Once the PDAQ is approved, it is
submitted to the Classification Unit in Talent Development & Human
Resources. The Classification Unit will review the PDAQ and determine
if the position is appropriately classified or not. If the Classification Unit
determines that the position is not classified correctly, it will provide a
recommendation to change the classification. The recommendation will
be reviewed and approved by the employee’s management up to and
including the appropriate Vice President. The approved
recommendation will then be submitted to the University’s Board of
Trustees for approval.

 Leave Without Compensation

If an employee is unable to work due to a documented medical
condition or for other approved reasons and they have exhausted all
accrued sick leave, vacation leave and compensatory time that they are
entitled to use, the employee may continue their approved absence
from work without pay and will retain status as a University employee.

Market Increase

The Classification unit in Talent Development & Human Resources will,
upon request from a dean or vice president, conduct a market
evaluation of a position or positions to determine if the University is
providing an appropriate level of compensation. If it is determined that
the current level of compensation is below the established market, a
recommendation will be made to adjust the current level of
compensation.

Merit Increase

Increase in pay granted for meeting established performance criteria.

Non-Renewal

Separation of employment of a Contract Professional employee without
cause in accordance with the requirements established in University
Rule 3359-22-01. The University is required to provide notice in writing
to the affected Contract Professional employee. If the individual has
two years or less service with the University, they will receive three
months’ notice. If the individual has more than two years of service, six
months’ notice is required.

Offline Salary Adjustment

Increase in salary that occurs outside of annual salary review process.
Recommendations for offline salary adjustments are submitted by the
appropriate Vice President to Talent Development & Human Resources
for review and approval. Offline salary adjustments are normally
recommended when specific market (internal or external) or equity
(internal) issues exist with an individual’s salary. Offline increases may
also be recommended as a result of a reorganization involving a change
in responsibilities.

Probationary Removal

Classified civil service employees are required to serve and successfully
complete a probationary period following any initial appointment into a
classified civil service position. If an employee’s service is found to be
unsatisfactory, the employee may be removed from the position at any
time during the probationary period. The length of the probationary
period is 120 days for classified civil service employees/CWA bargainingunit employees and one year for Police Officers in the FOP bargaining
unit. A probationary classified civil service employee duly removed for
unsatisfactory service does not have the right to appeal the removal to
the State Personnel Board of Review. A probationary bargaining unit
employee is not permitted to appeal the removal decision under the
terms of the collective bargaining agreements.

08142019 BOT Personnel Actions - Page 53

for activities outside of the normal scope of the employee’s assigned
classification (University Rule 3359-11-12.1). Full-time Faculty may
receive a stipend for primarily administrative functions requiring
substantial increases in responsibility and for activities not included in
the ordinary load of teaching, research, and professional service for fulltime faculty (University Rule 3359-11-12).

Supplemental

responsibilities.

Temporary Appointment

An appointment for a limited period of time with a specific beginning
and ending date.

Tenure Change

A change to the date for tenure eligibility for a full-time faculty member
in a tenure-track position.

An employee remains in their budgeted position, but the title changes
and there may be an increase in salary. No vacancy is created by the

Transfer

Lateral move of an employee from one department to another
department, where the employee stays in the same classification.

Training/Apprenticeship

Communication Workers of America contains language in Addendum A
that authorizes the Office of Talent Development & Human Resources
to develop and administer a Job Enrichment and Apprenticeship
Program for CWA bargaining-unit employees. Employees selected to
participate in the program are given an opportunity to expand their
knowledge and skills. In return, these employees are provided with an
increase in pay to reflect the expanded knowledge/skill set that they

Board of Trustees Consideration and Approval: Awards Exceeding $500,000

As requested of me, I provide to you the following procurements, which exceed $500,000 for
Board of Trustees consideration and approval at its meeting on August 14, 2019.
1.

Roo Express Shuttle Service Operator (Auxiliary Fund)
Parking and Transportation Services is proposing an award to ABM Parking Services
(ABM), the incumbent vendor since 2008, to operate the Roo Express Shuttle Service for
the period September 1, 2019 through August 31, 2022 with renewal options of up to four
years via two additional two-year periods upon mutual consent.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued during June 2019, and four proposals were
received and quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated with ABM selected as the best
value. The pricing is as follows:
•
•
•
•

ABM Parking Services – $1,548,000 or approximately $516,000 annually
LED Inc. - $1,677,000 or approximately $559,000 annually
LAZ Parking Midwest LLC - $1,842,000 or approximately $614,000 annually
Central Ohio Shuttle Service - $2,472,000 or approximately $824,000 annually

The cost for ABM for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 through 2019 averaged
$665,000. The rate per hour of operation for the current award is slightly higher than
prior years. Instead, the cost reduction is largely attributable to a consolidation of routes
which will provide similar service levels while reducing the number of service hours.
An award to ABM Parking Services is recommended by Parking and Transportation
Services and the Department of Purchasing. The contract was also reviewed and
approved as to legal form and sufficiency by the Office of General Counsel.

 Board Items for Consideration and Approval

Vendor
Dan Terreri & Sons, Inc.

Bid
$1,088,800

lowest responsible bid. Should the Board approve the transaction, the vendor award will
occur once the Controlling Board approves it and after General Counsel completes its
review for legal form and sufficiency.
I recommend that an award be made to Dan Terreri & Sons, Inc. in the amount of
$1,088,800 and request approval of the Board of Trustees at its meeting on August 14,
2019.

Proposed Resolutions for Naming the Athletics Leadership Academy and an area
in the College of Business Administration

Please find attached two resolutions detailing recommended actions to name the Athletics
Leadership Academy and an area with the College of Business Administration in honor of the
respective donors who have generously supported these two developments.
The first resolution is for naming the Athletics Leadership Academy in honor of University of
Akron alumni, Keith A. Cline, Jr. and Stephanie L. Cline. Mr. and Mrs. Cline generously
committed $1,250,000 to the Academy, which will provide leadership development
opportunities to University of Akron student-athletes. In appreciation of their commitment,
naming the Academy as The Keith A. Jr. and Stephanie L. Cline Athletics Leadership Academy
would be a fitting recognition of their support and devotion to Akron Athletics and The
University of Akron and its students.
The second resolution is for naming an area in The University of Akron College of Business
Administration in honor of University of Akron alumnus, Joseph C. Hete, and his wife Carrie J.
Hete. Mr. and Mrs. Hete provided a significant gift to renovate and equip an area in the College
which leads to the Anthony J. Alexander Professional Development Center currently under
construction. In appreciation of their gift, naming the area as The Joseph C. ’76 and Carrie J.
Hete Technology Common would be a fitting recognition of their support and devotion to the
University, the College of Business Administration and its students.
These proposed naming recommendations are appropriate and consistent with the University’s
Named Gift and Endowment Opportunities Policy Statement, Guidelines and Procedures.

her 103rd birthday in style at Fairlawn Country
Club. In addition to family and friends from UA,
Phyllis’ favorite mascot, Zippy, came to help
celebrate.
Zippy gave Phyllis a framed Zippy portrait drawn
by a student in The Myers School of Art. In honor
of this momentous occasion, the Berry Family
made gifts to the James R. and Phyllis C. Berry
Zippy Endowed Scholarship.
A portion of the gift will be used to award
scholarships to nine students in the Zippy
Program for the 2019-20 academic year.

 SCHOLARSHIP IN MEMORY OF BELOVED PROFESSOR,
ROBERT ZANGRANDO
The Robert L. Zangrando Memorial Endowed Scholarship, honoring
the memory of Robert L. Zangrando, a UA history professor, was
recently established by his family and friends.

Robert L. Zangrando

Bob, who taught from 1971 to 1994, specialized in 20th century
African-American and Women’s History. He published three books,
serving as co-editor of Civil Rights and the African-Americans:
A Documentary History; author of The NAACP Crusade Against
Lynching; and co-author of Walter F. White: The NAACP’s
Ambassador for Social Justice.

Bob was a tireless advocate for civil rights his entire life. He taught in a Mississippi freedom
school as part of the Freedom Summer in 1964 and was especially honored to be selected by
the NAACP for a presentation at the Library of Congress celebrating the ‘First One Hundred
Years of the NAACP.’
He served on the boards of the Akron Rape Crisis Center and Planned Parenthood, and was
the first male recipient of the Feminist of the Year Award from Akron Area National Organization
for Women (NOW) in 1990. He was a member of the Ohio Chicago Arts Project (O-CAP) that
successfully brought Judy Chicago’s Dinner Party to Cleveland, Ohio in May 1981. The scholarship
is intended to honor Bob’s lifelong commitment to promoting equal rights and educational
opportunities for minority students who, in turn, use their abilities and education to serve their
local communities.

KULAS CONCERT SERIES
The Kulas Foundation recently continued its support of the Kulas Concert Series, now in its
17th year. The series showcases performances by faculty, students and guest musicians.

NEW BASEBALL SCHOLARSHIP
The Scholarship for Akron Baseball Student-Athletes was established by Gary W. Kendron
and Barbara R. Bishop. Gary graduated from UA in 1972. Gary and Barb have supported
the University for many years as season ticket holders for Zips football and basketball
programs.
Their investment in baseball student-athletes stems
from their love of the game and because they were
excited at the news of the program’s return to
campus for the 2020 season.

CONTINUED SUPPORT FROM
JOSEPH AND CARRIE HETE HELPS CBA RENOVATION
Mr. Joseph C. and Carrie J. Hete recently made a generous gift, helping renovate the College
of Business Administration’s corridor, creating a beautiful transition from the current CBA
lobby and corridor into the new Anthony J. Alexander Professional Development Center.

 VERDERICO SCHOLARSHIP HELPS STUDENT IN NEED
Patrick and Roberta Verderico have been ardent supporters of The University of Akron and its
students for years. In 2009, through the Mary C. Verderico Family Endowed Scholarship, the
Verdericos and their family created a lasting legacy in honor of their mother Mary, who worked
tirelessly to makes sure that all of her seven children (all UA graduates)
understood the importance of education. Gifts to this scholarship have
helped UA students reach their goal of pursuing and completing their
first undergraduate degree.
Recently, a student in her last semester had exhausted all of her
general academic scholarship money. She had a 3.560 cumulative
GPA, was working four jobs, and her husband recently returned home
from Kuwait (four years active military) and had been having trouble
finding a job. An advisor suggested she reach out to financial aid.
The Mary C. Verderico Family Scholarship was able to help ease the
student’s financial burden.

2009 when her family
created a scholarship
in her honor.

GRANT ENABLES ACCESS TO INFORMATION
AND BRINGS PROFESSIONALS TO CAMPUS
The Akron Bar Foundation Law Library Committee provided a generous grant to provide
Bar Association members with access to Bloomberg, Westlaw and an ABA treatise collection
at the University of Akron School of Law Library.
The goal of the gift was bringing members of the legal community on campus, networking with
students and using Akron Law facilities. A room in the UA School of Law library, which has
two computer stations, a printer and supplies, has been designated for
use. The computers have access to Bloomberg Law - All access and
a limited patron access subscription from Westlaw, which covers all 50
states and federal primary and secondary material, as well as additional
form books and secondary sources. The terminals also provide access
to on campus resources such as HeinOnline, Proquest Congressional,
Hoovers, and all open access databases at the undergraduate library.

ANONYMOUS DONOR EMOTIONALLY MOVED
BY TRAGEDY, ESTABLISHES MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP
An anonymous UA alumnus was emotionally moved by the tragic
terrorist attack that killed his friend Jason Spindler, a U.S. business
professional of third-world economic development.
On January 15, 2019, Jason was killed by a terrorist attack while
working at an office complex in Nairobi, Kenya.
The anonymous alumnus established the Jason J. Spindler Memorial
Scholarship for an MBA student with an annual gift.

 WOMEN’S COMMITTEE SUPPORTS CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM
The UA Women’s Committee awarded $12,000 in support for The R.C. Musson and Katharine
M. Musson Charitable Foundation Industrial Control Systems Testbed. The testbed is part
of the University’s cybersecurity efforts to advance knowledge, skills and abilities in the
cybersecurity workforce.
Housed in the College of Applied Science and Technology’s Business and Information
Technology department, the cybersecurity program teaches ways and methods of protecting
manufacturing information systems, aiding Ohio manufacturer’s ability to fill high-demand
jobs and secure Ohio’s public and private infrastructures.
The Women’s Committee,
founded in 1948, has
dedicated countless
volunteer hours creating
interest in the University
by community members.
In addition to projectspecific grants, the
Committee provides
annual support to its
endowed scholarship,
its international college ambassador award,
and the Judith A. Read Memorial Leadership Award.

The Jason and Corinne Sumner Trust Fund made a gift to The Jason and Corinne Sumner
Scholarship providing financial assistance to University of Akron students.
The scholarship was established by Beatrice S. Williams, Class of 1908, in memory of her
parents, Jason and Corinne Sumner.

MATT KAULIG AND TEAM ENSURED GOLF OUTING’S SUCCESS
Once again, 1996 alumnus Matt Kaulig and the Kaulig Companies
were the title sponsor of the Akron Football Summer Jamboree Golf
Outing at Lake Forest Country Club in June. Although rain shortened
the outing to a luncheon with new head football coach Tom Arth, the
day was a success.
Kaulig and his Kaulig Companies team
provided financial assistance for the
event and support from Kaulig Media
and the Kaulig Giving staff.

Matt Kaulig ’96

Matt brought out the Kaulig Racing #11 race car (Matt’s
jersey number when he was quarterback for the UA football
team), which was decked out in Akron Zips blue and gold.
The University, the Department of Athletics and the football
team appreciate Matt and the Kaulig Companies’ efforts for
a successful event.

The great value
of engineering co-ops
One great strength of our College of
Engineering is its co-op program.
We have refreshed the co-op pages on
our site so prospective students can better
see the benefits of the program, such as
the fact that students who complete a
co-op earn, on average, $6,000 more in
starting salaries than those without such
experience.
The new pages include students talking
about their co-op experiences and how
they enhanced their classroom learning.

For parents, an insider’s guide to UA

We developed and mailed a new, 10-page
brochure — “A parent’s guide” — to parents
of prospective students, touting the excellence,
affordability, and long-term value of an education

On June 10, 2019, Dr. Matt Akers appeared on local television show Forum 360 to discuss
civility and the work of the Greater Akron Civility Center, which is housed under the Ray C.
Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at The University of Akron. Dr. Akers also spoke to the
Hudson Rotary Club about the work of the Greater Akron Civility Center on July 24.

 Ohio State Highway Patrol’s Akron Post Open House
On June 11, 2019, Government Relations assisted with an open house for the Ohio State
Highway Patrol Akron Post, which is the only one in the state located on a college campus. More
than 100 people, including local, county and state officials attended the open house and ribbon
cutting ceremony. The presence of the Ohio Highway Patrol on campus contributes to campus
safety. In a related safety effort, Mr. Nathan Mortimer, chief financial officer and vice president
for finance and administration, presented at the Town and Gown Summit at Kent State
University on July 18, 2019, along with colleagues from the County, about the University’s
efforts to improve the safety of nearby off-campus areas.

superintendent, Ohio State Highway Patrol; Dr. John Green, interim president, The University
of Akron; and Ilene Shaprio, Summit County Executive.)

Ohio Summer Social
On June 19, 2019, Government Relations hosted the Ohio Summer Social in Washington, D.C.
The reception brings together Ohio’s congressional delegation, staff, and sponsors of the event
for a networking reception. Hundreds of guests attend. Government Relations met with staff
from our congressional delegation to discuss legislation and research funding opportunities as
well as with University of Akron alumni.

 Summit County Council Recognizes the Akronauts
On June 24, 2019, Summit County Council recognized the achievements of the Akronauts, UA’s
student rocket-design team. The Akronauts placed third out of 45 teams overall at the 2019
NASA Student Launch Competition, held April 4-6 at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala. This is the highest the team has ever placed.

Mayor’s Youth Leadership Council
On June 26, 2019, Government Relations assisted in hosting Mayor Dan Horrigan’s Teen
Leadership Workshop on The University of Akron campus. The Public Liaison provided a
welcome to the students, and the students engaged in leadership activities throughout the day.
Students also took part in a tour of the University and an admissions presentation.

 The Public Liaison also helped facilitate a number of meetings on campus during June and July,
including an Elevate Greater Akron and University of Akron polymer discussion with
representatives from the GAR Foundation, the City, the County, the Greater Akron Chamber,
and University of Akron administration, and a financial literacy discussion between University
of Akron administration and Treasurer Robert Sprague’s staff and Congressman Anthony
Gonzalez’s staff.
State Legislative Update

H.B. 166 – Biennial Budget General Overview
The biennial budget was introduced on March 25, 2019 by Governor DeWine, which included
numerous positive provisions for the Higher Education community. Work by the Ohio House of
Representatives was completed on May 9, 2019, and retained many of those provisions and
added several other positive sections. The Senate concluded their review and changes on June
20, 2019, also retaining and including positive items for the higher education community. A
Conference Committee of Members from both the House and Senate was established on June 20,
2019 to create a final product.
Due to disagreements on several high-profile issues (including taxes and healthcare) the
Conference Committee was unable to meet the June 30 statutory deadline to pass a budget. This
was only the 2nd time in the last 28 years that the budget was not delivered on time. An interim
budget was passed, funding state government at FY2018 levels until July 17, 2019. After two
weeks of negotiations, the Conference Committee met on July 16, 2019, and passed the budget,
which then passed the House and Senate on July 17, 2019, and was delivered to Governor
DeWine for his signature. H.B. 166 passed both the House and the Senate with broad bi-partisan
majorities, which is also a rarity in modern times.
H.B. 166 – Enacted Budget Higher Education Provisions
The biennial budget included an unprecedented investment in higher education. The percentage
increases are more significant than have been seen in nearly a decade. Highlights important to
the University of Akron include:
• State Share of Instruction: A 2.1% increase in SSI in FY20 and an additional 1%
increase in FY21 (3% overall increase over previous biennium). Total SSI FY20 = $2.02
million, FY21 = $2.04 million stipulates that any institutional increase in SSI above prior
year shall be used to provide “need-based aid and to provide counseling, support services,
and workforce preparation services to students.” Language also included requiring Ohio
Department of Higher Education to conduct a study by 6/30/2020 as to benefits of adding
a weight to SSI formula for those institutions that can prove employment and job
placements, especially in high-demand fields.
• Bliss Institute Funding: Funding for the Bliss Institute for Applied Politics at $62,500
per fiscal year.
• Ohio College Opportunity Grant: Increased appropriations by $3 million in each fiscal
year and increased per pupil awards at Ohio’s public universities to $2,000 in FY20 and
$2,500 in FY21.
5

 •

•
•

Tuition Caps: Tuition at Ohio’s universities is limited to 2% (please note that the
University’s recently approved increase is less than the cap) and all four-year colleges
and universities are mandated to develop a Tuition Guarantee program (which the
University is also already participating in).
Tech-Cred: Provides $15 million in each Fiscal Year to support 10,000 “micro degrees”
or industry-recognized credentials through employee reimbursements (the actual
programmatic language will be addressed in separate legislation).
H2Ohio Program: The H2Ohio program, created to address water quality issues in Lake
Erie, was created and funded with up to $172 million in surplus revenue from Fiscal Year
2019, plus 50% of any GRF ending balance surplus in Fiscal Year 2021. The final
version included language that specifically included institutions of higher education to
participate in the program. A separate piece of legislation H.B. 7, which would create an
H2Ohio Advisory Council, is still pending in the Ohio Senate.

High-Level Meetings Related to Advocacy in H.B. 166
Over the several months that the biennial budget was being debated, UA Government Relations,
along with Interim-President Dr. John Green, participated in numerous meetings to advocate for
the University’s budget priorities. Several of those meetings with high-level individuals are as
follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Randy Gardner, Chancellor, Department of Higher Education
Senator Stephanie Kunze, Chair of the Senate Higher Education Committee
Senator Kristina Roegner, University of Akron Delegation
Laurel Dawson, Chief of Staff for Governor Mike DeWine
Ray DiRossi, Budget Director, Senate Republican Caucus
Goran Babic, higher education policy staffer for the Senate Republican Caucus

IUC Presidents Breakfast with Governor DeWine
On June 6, 2019, Interim-President Dr. John Green participated in a breakfast meeting with
Governor DeWine and many Presidents of Ohio’s colleges and universities. The topics discussed
during the meeting included budget provisions, a general discussion of hazing issues on
campuses, and early discussions on the 2020 capital budget process.
Legislation Update
H.B. 2 (Cross/LaPore-Hagan) & H.B. 4 (Richardson/Robinson) – H.B. 2 would create the
Tech-Credit program which would develop the Individual Microcredential Assistant Program to
develop a grant program for individuals and businesses who earn a short-term certificate in an indemand field as identified by the Chancellor of Higher Education. H.B. 4 requires the
Governor’s Office of Workforce Transformation to act as a liaison between the business
community and the Department of Education and the Department of Higher Education to
identify and assist businesses with identifying industry-recognized credentials that may be
offered to their employees. Language for these programs, and an appropriation, were included in
the Senate version of the budget. The appropriation was retained in Conference Committee, but
the program mechanics will be worked out in these bills this fall in the Ohio Senate as they have
already passed the House.
6

 H.B. 9 (Jones/Sweeney) – H.B. 9 would create a universal standard for general education
courses and would create an equivalency tool at the Department of Higher Education to assist in
the transfer of coursework between state institutions of higher education, among other
provisions. The IUC has been working with various legislators and all of the Government Affairs
personnel to improve on what we believe is a largely unnecessary bill. The bill passed the Ohio
House by a vote of 95-0 and may be considered in the Senate this fall.
H.B. 16 (Perales) – H.B. 16 would grant in-state tuition for active-duty members of the military
and their dependents who are stationed in the State of Ohio but may not be permanently
domiciled here. The bill received strong support from the Higher Education community and
passed the Ohio House unanimously, and, to date, has had one hearing in the Senate Higher
Education Committee. We anticipate passage in the fall.
H.B. 88 (Antani)/SB40 (Brenner/McColley) – Campus Free Speech. S.B. 40 is a re-draft of
H.B. 758 (Antani) from the 132nd General Assembly. H.B. 88 is also modeled after H.B. 758;
however, Representative Antani has also made some concerning additions to the bill. Both bills
would require Universities to protect expressive activities, bar the use of “free speech zones,”
and allow a civil action against the University for violations of the act. H.B. 88 goes on to
expand the definition of “harassment” by employees of higher education institutions, prohibit
charging security fees based on the content of the expression of the event, and would require
universities to adopt a harassment policy as prescribed by the bill. There has been no activity on
these bills for several months. Many universities have adopted policies similar to the “Chicago
Statement,” including The University of Akron, which may have dampened the immediate
“need” for the legislation.

S.B. 120 (McColley) – S.B. 120 would clarify that the Auditor of State may conduct a
performance audit of multiple institutions of higher education as necessary, as opposed to being
limited to one such audit per year. The bill passed the Ohio Senate unanimously and will now be
heard in the Ohio House of Representatives. (S.B. 120 was also included in the Senate version
of H.B. 166, the biennial budget, but was removed during the Conference Committee process.)

ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT REPORT

THE UNIVERSITY OF AKRON BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING

August 14, 2019

 The University of Akron – Enrollment Management Report
Board of Trustees Report – August 2019
2019 High School Class: Focus on Reducing Melt
Throughout the summer, we have been focused on keeping our confirmed students, as well as
their parents engaged and excited about enrolling at UA this fall. We have been working closely
with our campus partners to reduce the melt through our bi-weekly Yield Group meetings;
meetings this summer with each Dean and his/her leadership team; frequent communication with
our colleagues in New Student Orientation, Student Financial Aid, Student Accounts and
Residence Life & Housing.
Finally, our technical teams in enrollment management have developed tools to learn more about
why students have decided to enroll or not enroll at UA.
Outreach/Communication to Students
The Mark your Calendar postcard was mailed this summer to confirmed students. The postcard
provides information about on-campus housing move-in, Convocation, New Roo Weekend, first
day of classes, Week of Welcome, first Zips athletics events, Homecoming/Family Weekend,
Make a Difference Day and more.

UA Class T-shirts are distributed at each New Student Orientation program. Students continue to
add their posts to the uakron2023 Instagram page that was created for them. Some of the UA
organizations have been connecting with students via this channel. Currently over 300 new
students have posted their profiles on this page.
1 Page

 Monthly emails continue to be sent to students who are confirmed with content that focuses on
exciting messages about their transition to UA.
Outreach/Communication to Parents
Admissions continues to send emails on a monthly basis to parents of confirmed students. The
content of the emails are timely/helpful messages of support. The information assists them with
their students’ transition from high school/home to college/UA.
A letter from Admissions will be mailed to parents of confirmed students in mid-August. The
mailing includes UA athletic ticket vouchers and a letter that encourages their attendance at the
Parent/Family Weekend.
Parents are encouraged via emails and a letter to join the Parent/Family Facebook group. A
Facebook live was conducted in July to help parents understand the UA billing process.

2020 High School Class: Focus on Inquiry Generation and Application Generation
Throughout the summer, we reviewed our goals, strategies and tactics pertaining to the
recruitment cycle for the 2020 class. The Admissions Office has been working/communicating
with many of the 2020 high school students since their sophomore year. Prospective students
will be able to start applying to UA on August 1.
Events
Admissions invited rising high school seniors and juniors to visit UA and participate in our
Summer Visit Days. On June 21, the more than 500 students and parents in attendance had an
opportunity to interact with representatives from their academic interest area, speak with several
student services areas, tour campus, tour select
residence halls, and have lunch in one of our
dining facilities. Each student in attendance
received a complimentary Zip Card to use to
purchase lunch. Admissions will host two more
Summer Visit Days on Friday, July 26 and
Friday, Aug. 9.
Admissions continues to offer Daily Information
Sessions and Campus Tours Monday through
Friday in the morning and afternoon. These
sessions consist of an information session that
focuses on the Akron advantages and steps in the
enrollment process, as well as a student-guided
campus tour.
The Admissions Officers also continue to host
personal visits. The personal visits typically
consist of a one-on-one meeting with their
Admissions Counselor, meeting with a
2 Page

 representative from the academic interest area, campus tour with a current student and
complimentary lunch for the student and their guests on campus.
Admissions will host three major visit days this fall—our Engineering Visit Day on Friday, Sept.
27, Fall Visit Day on Saturday, Oct. 19, and Fall Visit Day on Saturday, Nov. 2.

Communication
Printed invitations for our major visit days this fall will be mailed in late August. Electronic
invitations are sent on a nearly weekly basis to students (inquiries and prospects) and parents.
We also utilize social media (typically Facebook and Instagram) to promote the visit days.
The Parent Brochure, which is a new
publication, was mailed in late June to parents
of rising high school seniors. The brochure
promoted the Akron advantages including
quality, in-demand academics, support services
for students, community life, affordability,
steps in the enrollment process, and more. The
mailing included a letter from Admissions.
The Senior Mailer was mailed in July to rising
high school seniors. The ‘call to action’ of this
brochure is to encourage students to apply when
the application is available on Aug. 1.
The new Viewbook will be mailed in late
August/early September to seniors in high
school. This is a major publication that focuses
on the Akron Advantages. The ‘call to action’
of this brochure is to encourage students to
apply to UA.
Admissions will begin mailing acceptance
packets to admitted students in August.
.
Integrated efforts between UA, EAB and Fathom
UA, EAB and Fathom will work together to encourage 2020 high school students to apply to
UA. Target markets include Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and
North Carolina. Intensive direct mail, email and digital marketing campaigns will build affinity
with applicants and guide them through the application process.
A Communication Summit with representatives from UA, EAB and Fathom was held in July to
ensure student-focused messaging, copy and imagery across all channels. Representatives from
3 Page

 UA, EAB and Fathom will continue to meet on a monthly basis throughout the recruitment cycle
to analyze the campaigns and enrollment performance.
Transfer and Adult Students: Focus on Outreach
The Transfer and Adult Student Enrollment Center within the
Office of Admissions participated in two Summer Open House
programs in July at Stark State Community College. There were
200 students scheduled to attend the Stark State Main Campus
program in North Canton and 200 students scheduled for the Stark
State Akron campus.
The focus of the program was the promotion of the Direct Connect
program in collaboration with Stark State. This was the first
program we have been asked to attend and promote opportunities at
The University of Akron.
The Transfer and Adult Student Enrollment Center also is working
with UC&M on a refresh of the Transfer website. The refresh was
driven by recent data and design concept shared by UC&M.

Financial Aid: Focus on Student Support
The Office of Student Financial Aid will continue the collaboration with Blackboard Student
Services for the operation of a Financial Aid Support Center including 24/7/365 customer
support and advising, online chat, and a website providing searchable articles and trending topics
in financial aid.
Since the partnership went live on May 23, 2018, advisors in the support center have taken more
than 32,000 calls from students, parents, staff and other financial aid customers. The average
hold time before a customer’s call is answered is approximately two minutes, with the fastest
answer time being 39 seconds.
Visitors to the office have an average wait time of less than five minutes to see an advisor in
person and processing timelines have improved significantly resulting in faster delivery of
awards to students during times when they are making critical enrollment decisions. Currently,
one month before the beginning of the fall semester, the processing timeline for student loan
requests is 24 hours from request to posting the award to the students’ accounts. This is
unprecedented and attributed to the increased productivity as a result of outsourcing telephone
calls and chat through our Financial Aid Support Center.
Through the Hail We Akron Scholarship, a new focus has been given to assist students who are
academically talented but lack support through parent contribution to help close their funding
gap between charges and other financial aid. For the fall semester, more than 50 students have
been awarded more than $100,000 in scholarships.

 Personnel: Focus on Professional Development
Jonathan Gates, admissions counselor in the Transfer and
Adult Student Enrollment Center was selected by the Ohio
Transfer Council as the ‘Outstanding New Member for
2019’at its annual conference in June.
Gates was recognized for establishing a social media
platform for Ohio Transfer Council members to better
facilitate communication. The platform allowed members
to better share thoughts, ideas and updates related to
transfer student polices and initiatives.
The Ohio Transfer Council is an organization committed
to the enhancement and facilitation of transfer for students
between and among its member institutions in the state of
Ohio.
The Admissions technical team attended and presented at the Target X Summit in July. Sue
McKibben and Aparajita Tiwari presented ‘Utilizing Effective Documentation to Engage Your
Users’. The presentation highlighted a variety of documentation templates used by the University
of Akron – including business process documentation, checklists and job aids.
Manoj Muthireddy and Robert Bird presented ‘A Customized Approach to Confirm Your
Enrollment’. The presentation focused on how UA is leveraging multiple Target X features to
encourage students to confirm their enrollment.
OACAC Summer Institute
UA is the host site for the Ohio Association for College Admission Counseling (OACAC)
Summer Institute program

This program brings new college access partners with two years or less of experience together to
foster a deeper understanding of the interaction between admissions counselors, high school
counselors and community-based organizations as well as expert insight into current trends and
issues within the profession. Jake Kos, Assistant Director of Admissions at UA, is co-chairing
Summer Institute this year.

RESEARCH REPORT

THE UNIVERSITY OF AKRON BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING

August 14, 2019

 Report to the Board of Trustees
August 2019

___________________________________________________________________________________________

RESEARCH & SCHOLARLY ACTIVITIES

RESEARCH 1

 Research and Scholarly Activities Highlights
$1.13 million National Cancer Institute grant awarded to Biomedical Engineering professor
Dr. Hossein Tavana, associate professor of biomedical
engineering, has been awarded $1.13 million from the
National Cancer Institute to further develop 3D tumor
models of triple-negative breast cancer which may
improve drug testing, lead to the discovery of new, more effective anticancer drugs,
and lead to a deeper understanding of the drivers of the disease.
Dr. Tavana has now received more than $2 million in federal funding within one year,
having already garnered significant support from the National Institutes of Health and
the National Science Foundation for his innovative research on 3D tumor models.
The 3D models developed in Tavana’s Tissue Engineering Microtechnologies lab, which have already led to
several issued U.S. patents, more accurately replicate human tumors than do traditional 2D cultures on a Petri
dish, enabling more accurate drug testing and the discovery of new drugs.
“Through this research, we expect to establish our technology as a
transformative advance that will be implemented broadly for drug discovery,
studies of breast cancer and other malignancies, and precision medicine through
incorporating patient-derived cells,” Tavana said.
“Competition for the NIH’s NCI grants is fierce, and universities with a medical
school or partnership with cancer centers have a major advantage,” he added.
“UA has neither, so it is a testament to the strength of our research that we
have secured continuous funding from NIH for the past seven years.”

Chemical Engineering grad student wins award for converting soybean waste into something useful
Ashwin Sancheti, a PhD student in chemical engineering, has figured out a
way to convert a major waste stream in soybean processing into
something useful. The potential impact on this $40 billion dollar a year
industry would be huge.
Soybeans produce soybean oil, a valuable product used in industrial and
consumer products from candles to cosmetics. Soybeans are also a rich
source of protein for food and feed uses. Collecting oil and high-protein
products from soybeans leaves behind a large amount of soy molasses as
a no or low-value byproduct, which is sometimes used as an additive in
animal feed.
Sancheti’s presentation at the recent Annual American Oil Chemist's Society conference focused on using
enzymes to convert the soy molasses into sugars like glucose, fructose and galactose. These sugars can then be
fermented into other bioproducts that, for example, can be used in different oil-based applications ranging from
lubricants to soaps and polymer additives. The market values of these products are much higher than the soy
molasses.
Sancheti, along with his advisor Dr. Lu-Kwang Ju and other researchers, have been working on this project for a
few years. The project is sponsored by the United Soybean Board as part of a biorefinery team consisting of
universities and companies. They hope to move this to a pilot program in a soybean plant in the near future.

 “The Veteran Wage Differential”
Military veterans are faring better in the workplace than their non-veteran counterparts. In
fact, between 2005 and 2015, veterans’ average hourly wages were nearly $5 higher — at
almost $26 an hour — compared to $21 an hour for non-veterans. Those findings, and
more, by faculty economists Dr. Francesco Renna, associate professor, and Dr. Amanda
Weinstein, assistant professor, both in the Department of Economics, are discussed in their
paper published in the journal Applied Economics. They explain that the wage differential is
driven by observable factors such as education, occupation and industry, but also by
location choice — a factor that has been previously overlooked in the literature.
Though the transition from military service to the private
sector can be difficult for many veterans, when veterans do find employment,
they tend to be quite successful in the workplace. Nearly 90% of the wage gap
between veterans and non-veterans can be explained by veterans earning
higher wages for exhibiting higher levels of observable characteristics that are
typically rewarded in the labor force. For example, veterans tend to have higher
educational attainment (thanks to policies like the G.I. Bill) and higher overall
skill levels, from cognitive skills to people skills. Military background is especially beneficial among veterans with
lower socioeconomic status (including lower incomes, black veterans, and women veterans) as military service
may act as a bridge to greater economic opportunities.
Despite the economic success of veterans, Renna and Weinstein’s results suggest that veterans should
actually be outperforming non-veterans by an even larger margin. For reasons that can’t be explained, the
veteran premium (the unexplained small boost in earnings) often turns into a veteran penalty (an unexplained
decrease in earnings). It is possible that there may be a stigma associated with military service that manifests as
discrimination in the labor market especially among veterans that enter into higher socioeconomic careers. The
researchers also found this unexplained decrease in earnings evident in areas where there is a smaller military
presence — where people haven’t had much opportunity to interact with veterans. Yet, the data shows that
with their skills, veterans could do quite well if they locate in these areas.
“Veterans are a mobile population and choosing a productive city to live in and work can help improve their
economic outcomes,” said Weinstein. “Any city or town should consider itself lucky if veterans want to locate
there.”

Using Q Methodology to study Q methodology
Susan Ramlo's article titled “Divergent viewpoints about the
statistical stage of a mixed method: Qualitative versus
quantitative orientations” was published by International
Journal of Research & Method in Education. The article uses Q
methodology to study Q methodologists’ beliefs about the
statistical stage of the larger methodology.
Q methodology is a social and behavioral science methodology
used to study subjectivity (e.g. people’s viewpoints).
Ramlo, professor of general technology – physics, has served as president of the international Q society, the
International Society for the Scientific Study of Subjectivity, and she has published more than 30 refereed
journal articles related to Q methodology, including a book chapter, with three additional book chapters in
process.

 Technology Transfer Highlights
S4 Global Laboratories license UA spectroscopy technology
Ohio-based company S4 Global Laboratories recently signed an
agreement to license UA shallow subsurface spectroscopy
technology that can be used to detect underground soil chemistry
and even find clandestine burials. The technology was developed
collaboratively by Professor of Anthropology Timothy Matney,
Emeritus Professor of Chemistry David Perry, Associate Professor
of Giosciences Linda Barrett, and chemistry Ph.D. candidate Afrin
Lopa. It uses a specialized probe, which is inserted in the ground
and collects detail chemical signatures. An early prototype of the
UA technology is currently being field tested in several settings
and has already garnered interest from several law enforcement
agencies.

UA and technology licensee eSens win collaborative National Science Foundation STTR award
eSens, an Akron-based company that has licensed UA flexible sensor
technology, is collaborating with UA on a National Science Foundation STTR
award. The award, which totals $225,000, will fund new advances in the
technology, which can be used to make thin, conformable sensors that slip
within shoes and detect running form or walking gait. Associate Professor of
Mechanical Engineering Jae-Won Choi, an inventor of the technology, will lead
UA’s research efforts, which are focused on detecting shear forces that can be
an early indicator of diabetic foot ulcers.

Two UA teams selected for National Science Foundation I-Corps Node training
Two University of Akron teams were selected to participate in training at
National Science Foundation I-Corps Nodes. A subset of the best prepared
and most promising NSF funding recipients are trained at I-Corps Nodes
each year. This year, Associate Professor Zhenmeng Peng and Ph.D.
candidate Dezhen Wu from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular
Engineering, and Timken Professor Gary Doll and postdoc Brandon Strahin
from the Department of Civil Engineering were selected. Both teams are
being mentored in the I-Corps program by UA Research Foundation Project
Executive Art Greenberg. The teams will go through a rigorous 7-week
process to explore the full commercial potential of their technologies,
including talking to prospective customers and developing a business
model. These intensive 7-week training programs are a follow on
to training UA and its Research Foundation provide locally in Akron.

THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES   August 14, 2019
THE UNIVERSITY OF AKRON RESIDENCE LIFE AND HOUSING RECEIVES NACURH
“SCHOOL OF THE YEAR”
The University of Akron was chosen as School of the Year 2019 at the NACURH (National Association of College and
University Residence Halls) conference, held at Louisiana State University. Of the 350 affiliated schools in the
nation, eight schools wrote and developed a 30-page bid to highlight their co-curricular residential excellence on
campus. In the University of Akron bid, the work of Residence Hall Council, National Residence Hall Honorary,
Residence Hall Program Board, Sigma Lambda Honorary, Hall Government and Residential Education were all
highlighted. The eight schools up for School of the Year were: Columbia, NC State, NYU, Oklahoma State, Truman
State, University of British Columbia and Western Illinois University. This award was selected at the NACURH
Annual Conference by the NACURH Board of Directors. The NACURH School of the Year Award is the highest honor
member schools can attain. The award recognizes outstanding achievements on the campus level by a residence
hall organization and affiliated groups, as well as contributions on regional and NACURH levels.
The University of Akron has won this prestigious award twice before – in 1992 and 2000.

Each semester, Career Services invites all current and new employers to “Come to Campus” to connect
with our students. For Fall 2019, this invitation will reach 17,000+ employer contacts and includes
information on how to participate in: Career Fairs, Etiquette Lunch, Employer Office Hours, Classroom Zip
Talks, recruitment tables in the Student Union, on-Campus interviews in the 11 employer interview rooms
available in Career Services, recruitment flyer displays, and branding and marketing of job opportunities
on Career Services social media. Employers were also invited to post their job and experiential learning
opportunities and hiring events on our job board, Handshake.

CAREER OUTCOMES FOR SPRING 2018
National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE
2014) defines the term “knowledge rate” as the percent
of graduates for which the institution has reasonable and
verifiable information concerning the graduates’
postgraduation career activities. This information may
come directly from the graduates via, for example, a
survey method. It may also be provided by employers, or
obtained through other sources (e.g., LinkedIn profiles,
other online sources, fellow graduates, or parents).
Based on this methodology, Career Outcomes for spring
2018 show that UA’s Overall Placement Rate is 92
percent! The Overall Placement Rate includes graduates
who earned an undergraduate degree and are employed
full time, part time, or are continuing their education.
That’s well above the 2017 national Overall Placement
Rate of 81 percent, according to the latest data from the
NACE. UA’s 92 percent Overall Placement Rate is up
from 89 percent in the same period in 2017.

 •

In addition, 80% of spring 2018 graduates who earned an undergraduate degree from UA are
employed full-time in their chosen field or in a position that requires a degree, or they are
continuing their education (i.e. graduate school). That’s up from 77% a year ago.
• Experiential learning opportunities for UA students continue to grow. Of those who graduated with
a bachelor’s degree in 2018, 83% participated in at least one experiential learning experience
before graduating (compared to 78% in 2017). The average starting salary for spring 2018
graduates who participated in experiential learning opportunities, while attending UA was $54,014
— $5,418 more than UA students who graduated without such experience.
• These 2018 Career Outcomes are based upon the knowledge rate of what 92% of the graduates
are doing 6 months post-graduation.

HANDSHAKE
Career Services developed a quick way for faculty to check out which employers are recruiting the students from
their program using RSS Feeds through Handshake. RSS Feeds (external feeds) were created for each college that
let faculty view job openings on Handshake. Each feed is a live link to a list of up to 200 job postings by major that
are currently active on Handshake for students and/or alumni.

HIGH SCHOOL ENGAGMENT
Student Recreation and Wellness Services hosted six area high schools After Proms at the Student Recreation
and Wellness Center. Each event is approximately five hours long and the schools utilize various facility space
and equipment including all five courts, the Leisure Pool, Rock Wall, table tennis, and yard games, and studios.
These events not only provide revenue generation but also brought 875 high school students to The University
of Akron, highlighting the campus community and opportunities we offer.
• 5/10 Archbishop Hoban High School with 150 participants and 20 chaperones
• 5/11 Ellet High School with 200 participants and 15 chaperones
• 5/17 Firestone High School with 250 participants and 15 chaperones

chapter, council and/or community.
National Award-Winning Chapter
At Alpha Delta Pi’s 168th Anniversary Grand Convention, the
Beta Tau Chapter of Alpha Delta Pi won The Maxine Blake
Golden Lion Award. This award is the highest national honor
that a chapter can receive and recognizes only those chapters
that meet the highest standards. ADPi at UA was one of twelve
chapters to receive this award of the 161 chapters
internationally. It was the 5th time they have received it since it
was established in 1973.

 DIRECT CONNECT WELCOME EVENT
On May 17, the Direct Connect Welcome Event was held in Simmons Hall. Nine participants attended the Welcome
Event to learn more about the program’s benefits, UA services and engagement opportunities, and receive their
special Direct Connect Zip Card. During the event, President Jones from Stark State College and President Green
from The University of Akron attended the beginning of the Welcome Event to address the participants.

FUTURE ZIPS CONFIRMATION FEE AWARD & WORKSHOP
New Student Orientation has awarded 25 students the Future Zips Confirmation Fee Award this summer. Of the 25
awardees, 19 have attended a Future Zips Financial Workshop, which is intentionally designed to address some of
the financial barriers that students face when beginning college. During the workshop, students explore their My
Akron accounts, learn about student employment opportunities, sit down one on one with financial aid and
student accounts, do hands on activities, and find out more about living on campus or commuting from home.

START STRONG/FINISH STRONGER
All new freshmen and their families attend the Start Strong/Finish
Stronger presentation during New Student Orientation programs.
The theme of the presentation is to encourage new students to
achieve their academic goals. The presentation is intended to cause
students to reflect during the summer prior to their start of their
UA academic career, and for the students’ family, friends and
others to know that we are all connected together toward the
support of their students. Reflective conversation topics include the
importance of establishing connected and supportive relationships
with individuals on campus; the benefit and power of student engagement with the UA campus; discussing how
data shows exploration as a freshman leads to higher GPAs following their freshman year; the benefits of
commitment and resources available toward assisting in achieving that commitment; and granting permission for
each student to begin reflecting on what is called “your story,” to become a dreamer, a maker, and an action taker.

Summary of Rules Committee Agenda Items for the
August 14, 2019 Meeting of the Board of Trustees

The Rules Committee will be asked to consider revisions to the following Rules at its
meeting on August 9, 2019:

1.

O.A.C. 3359-10-02 The universi of Akron laws of the facul senate.

 

The Faculty Senate recommends revisions to its bylaws to update terminology and
to re?ect the practice of the Faculty Senate. The Faculty Senate has approved these
revisions to its own rules.

O.A.C. 3359-11-17 - Con?ict of interest, con?ict of commitment, scholarly
misconduct, and ethical conduct - goiicies and procedures.

The Of?ce of Academic Affairs proposes revisions to the con?ict of interest rule
to make the rule more consistent with Ohio law and with the updated University
process to identify, prevent, and manage con?icts of interest.

O.A.C. 3359-43-01 Constitution.

John Messina, Vice President for Student Affairs, and members of the
Undergraduate Student Government (USG) recommend revisions to their
governing documents. The proposed revisions are intended to re?ect practices,
which are intended to better serve their constituents, including the addition of
guiding principles (Mission, Vision, and Values). The President of Undergraduate
Student Government has advised Dr. Messina that the proposed revisions were
presented to the student body and were approved by a majority vote.

4. 0.A.C. 3359-11-09 World Wide Web - to be rescinded.

University Communications and Marketing recommends that this rule be rescinded,
since the rule is out-of-date. Updated information related to the oversight of, and
guidelines for, the University?s webpages is contained on the University
Communications and Marketing website and, more generally, in the computer
acceptable use rule (0.A.C. 3359-11-10).

5. 0.A.C. 3359-11-10.7 Privacy Policy to be rescinded.

University Communications and Marketing recommends that this rule be rescinded,
since the rule is out-of-date. Updated information related to privacy is contained
in a revised policy that will be posted on the University Communications and
Marketing website and on the privacy information portion of the IT website.
Because of the ?uid nature of privacy obligations and frequently changing privacy
laws, maintaining the privacy information in this format will permit the University
to make timely adjustments to its policies and practices, which are necessary to
re?ect changes in the law. Broader issues of computer acceptable use also are
contained in the computer acceptable use rule (0.A.C. 3359-11-10).

6. 0.A.C. 3359-20-06?2 College Lecturer to be rescinded.
The Of?ce of Academic Affairs recommended rescinding this rule, since the

AAUP contract removed college lecturer ?om the faculty ranks and this title no
longer is used.

Conflict of interest, conflict of commitment, scholarly misconduct, and
ethical conduct - policies and procedures.

(A) Introduction.
These policies and procedures represent an evolving set of documents. The complexity
of the subject matter is such that the current policies and procedures will need a yearly
formal review by the senior research officer of the university with the advice of the
faculty senate and other bodies which have interest. This policy is intended to conform
to all laws and regulations, state or federal, regarding funded research.
(B) Policies and procedures regarding conflicts of interest and/or commitment.
(1) Each university employee will review and comply with these policies by promptly
taking whatever steps are required to avoid, eliminate, remediate or manage an
actual conflict of interest and/or commitment. This also includes graduate students,
identified as investigators on externally funded grants.
(2) On the first day of May thirtieth of April, each university employee will submit a
potential conflict of interest/commitment and request for pre-approval of outside
activities form questionnaire (yearly conflict of interest and commitment report) to
her or his immediate supervisor that discloses any outside activities that could
represent a conflict of interest and/or commitment seeking preapproval for the
upcoming year. In addition, employees are required to update the form during the
course of the year seeking preapproval for any additional proposed outside
activities.
(3) Written disclosure to the immediate supervisor is required pursuant to this rule during
the individual's employment contract when additional outside consulting activities
arise that could represent a conflict of interest and/or commitment.
(4) Outside consulting activities of full-time employees will be governed by the
following:
(a) All forms of outside activities that involve a time commitment at the expense of
an employee's primary responsibilities to the university during an individual's
employment contract must be disclosed.
(b) The maximum allowable time permitted for outside consulting activities is one
day per week on average during the period of the university academic-year or
calendar year contract. Particular circumstances, including but not limited to
teaching assignments or other scheduled university duties and/or the terms and
conditions of support of university grants or contracts, will be taken into account
in approving such arrangements.

 3359-11-17

(c) The responsibilities and professional activities that constitute an appropriate and
primary commitment will differ across colleges, schools, departments, and
disciplines, but should be based on an understanding among the employee,
his/her department chair, dean or administrative supervisor(s), and the executive
vice president and chief administrative officer senior vice president and provost
and chief operating officer, and in accord with university policies.
(d) University resources both human (e.g. students, support staff) and material, may
not be used for any purpose that is unrelated to the mission of the university and
neither for outside consulting nor for private gain. This shall not apply to use of
material resources used in a purely trivial and incidental way.
(5) Failure to pre-disclose and manage conflicts of interest and/or commitment may
subject the employee open to sanctions and possible legal actions. (As defined in
paragraphs (D)(3) and (D)(4) of this rule.)
(6) Outside activities in violation of state or federal laws or regulations (including but not
limited to: "PHS Promoting Objectivity in Research, 42 U.S.C. 216, 289b-1, 299c-4;
Sec. 219, Tit. II, Div. D, Pub. L. 111-117, 123 Stat. 3034 (2012)"; "national science
foundation investigator financial disclosure policy," 59 fed. reg. 33,308 (1994) and
60 fed. reg. 35,820 (1995); Ohio ethics law Chapter 102. of the Revised Code; and
section 2921.42 and section 2921.43 of the Revised Code), subject an employee to
discipline up to and including termination of employment by the university.
(7) Managing potential conflicts of interest and/or commitment requires timely and
accurate disclosure. Therefore, all university employees who engage in outside
activities are required to seek prior approval of to disclose those activities as they
are encountered in accordance with the following guidelines:
(a) Some outside activities, which might be considered conflicts in a technical sense,
are routinely allowable without permission but with timely notice to the
immediate supervisor because they are (i) accepted practices and (ii) generally
minimal in their personal financial impact and impact on the university.
Examples of such activities: public service in community service agencies,
royalties for published scholarly works or institutional royalty sharing,
honoraria, prizes and awards for professional recognition, or routine activities
for professional organizations and associations.
(b) All forms of outside activities which do not fit the above category and do involve
(i) a time commitment of one day or less per week (on average) during the
employment contract during the period of the university academic year or

Disclosure reports are to be made in written form with simple statements of

 3359-11-17

3

what is being done, for whom, and at what level of compensation (e.g., less than
ten thousand dollars). If there is no significant conflict of interest or
commitment and the activities are common, the supervisor shall so certify and
file the report with signed certification in the department or equivalent level
personnel file. Certification is required prior to an employee engaging in any
such activity. Examples of such activities: extensive activities for professional
organizations and associations.
(c) All other forms of outside activity which involve a time commitment in excess of
one day per week on average during the period of the university academic year
or calendar year contract or outside activities for which an employee receives
remuneration valued at ten thousand dollars or above from a single source
during the employees university contract period are to be reported to the
immediate supervisor (e.g., department chair or supervisor). Disclosure reports
are to be in written form with simple statements of what is being done, for
whom, and at what level of compensation (e.g., more than ten thousand dollars).
Preapproval Certification is required prior to an employee engaging in any such
activity. If the immediate supervisor certifies, he/she will, with signed
certification forward the request to his/her immediate supervisor (e.g., college
dean or division director). If the intermediate supervisor certifies, he/she will
report the request to the appropriate central administration officer (e.g.,
executive vice president and chief administrative officer senior research officer
or executive director for human resources). The request will be kept on file at
that location.
(8) All university employees are to complete the yearly potential conflict of
interest/commitment and request for pre-approval of outside activities form conflict
of interest and commitment report questionnaire on or before the first of May and
continue to update the form throughout the year thirtieth of April. Completed reports
are to be sent for certification to the employees' employee's immediate supervisor
for preapproval of the activity. If an item on the questionnaire is checked yes, then
the The employee's employees' immediate supervisor will forward the report to
his/her immediate supervisor (i.e., college dean, division chair) for certification
preapproval who will, in turn, forward the report to the appropriate central
administrative officer (i.e., executive vice president and chief administrative officer
senior research officer or executive director for human resources) for final review
and approval or denial. Forwarded annual disclosure reports will be kept in the
appropriate central administrative office. Annual reports with all no responses will
be kept at the department level. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
prohibit disclosures required as defined in paragraph (B)(17) of this rule.
University student assistants employed solely on an hourly pay basis, part-time
teaching faculty, and employees working less than half-time are exempt from
submitting the annual disclosure form but nonetheless are to comply with the

persons on these matters are to be referred to their department chair.
(9) University employees with knowledge of an impending arrangement between the
university and an outside entity with which they or their family members have
financial interests, employment, or other involvements are to disclose those facts to
their administrative superior before the university approves the proposed

outside activities, including consulting, such disclosures also are to identify any
office or fiduciary relationship with a not-for-profit corporation or public board or
agency.

employees during the course of the individual's employment contract with the
university or using university resources is the property of the university.
Inventions or discoveries made using any university facilities or other university
resources belong to the university even if the inventors are not university employees,
unless otherwise stipulated in a specific written university patent rights agreement
signed by an authorized university official delegated such authority by the university
board of trustees.
University intellectual property, including inventions and computer software, is to
be managed under rule 3359-02-05 of the Administrative Code. The university will
share with inventors and software authors any net royalties or royalty-type income
that may be gained as a direct result of licensing or attempting to license the
intellectual property.
University employees are to disclose in a timely manner to the university: (a) their
own creation or discovery of inventions and computer software which are developed
using university resources, regardless of sponsorship; (b) any discoveries and
inventions utilizing university resources, including those resulting from their
participation in sponsored research or other sponsored programs, other remunerative
outside activities in their field of academic interest or specialization, or any other
activities of an outside commercial enterprise, including any university
employee-owned or employee-managed company; and/or (c) the creation or
discovery of inventions of any others associated with them when that development
involved any university resources.
No university employee is to provide confidential or proprietary information
including disclosures or other information regarding inventions or other intellectual
property, to a company or other entity or its agents without prior disclosure to and
specific permission from the university board of trustees upon recommendation of
the vice president for research.
(16) University employees who wish to propose or are involved in university sponsored
research or other sponsored programs are expected to review and adhere to all
university policies, procedures, and obligations related to proposing, managing,
reporting of results, and other aspects of such projects.
(17) The university requires that investigators disclose to the university's director of the

 3359-11-17

6

office of research administration any potential conflicts of interest prior to the
submission of a proposal for funding. If a new conflict of interest arises at any time
during the period after submission of the proposal through the period of award, the
filing of a disclosure and immediate action toward remediation is required. Each
investigator must disclose all significant financial interests including those of family
members if legally required, as well as any other potential conflicts of interest as
defined in paragraphs (HG)(6) and (HG)(2120) of this rule.
(a) That would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the
research or educational activities funded, or proposed for funding, by an
external sponsor or
(b) In entities whose financial interests would reasonably appear to be directly and
significantly affected by such activities.
(18) Conflict policies regarding research projects:
(a) University employees are prohibited from independently submitting or negotiating
proposals or contracts for any externally sponsored research or other sponsored
programs on behalf of the university. Proposals, and any subsequent
negotiations, awards, other agreements, or changes are to be processed through
and require the prior written authorization of the university through the office of
research administration.
(b) All university employee involvement in proposals for sponsored research or other
programs at other institutions must be approved in advance through the office of
research administration. University employee involvement in a program or
project at another institution that might be conducted appropriately at the
university of Akron as part of normal employee duties could result in situations
that place students and staff in conflicts of interest, and deprive students and
colleagues of the faculty members or other employees primary intellectual
energies. A bona fide subgrant or subcontract agreement of equitable terms,
normally involving one institution as fiscal agent and the other(s) as
subgrantee(s), negotiated in advance between the university and the other
institution(s), and naming the university employee among the key personnel for
the project, is an appropriate means for a university employee or team to
participate in inter-institutional research projects or other sponsored programs.
(c) University employees must receive specific prior written approval from the senior
research officer to divert funded research opportunities or other sponsored
program support from the university to other institutions or external entities.
(d) A university employee will inform students and all workers engaged in research
or other sponsored programs to be conducted under his or her supervision of all
details, policies, and procedures concerning the project needed for the students

 3359-11-17

7

and workers to perform their role. These include full disclosure of the terms of
the agreement in support of the activity, including concerning copyrights or
patent rights arising from the research; policies and procedures governing
scholarly misconduct; and other as applicable (e.g. health and safety regulations,
protection of human rights, ethical care and use of animals, radiation safety,
biohazard safety).
(e) It is the responsibility of each university employee to disclose promptly to the
senior research officer any situation or proposal in which the objectivity of a
university employee or participant in a research project could be reasonably
questioned.
(19) Conflicts involving university contracts:
(a) University employees are prohibited from negotiating or entering into contracts or
other agreements which claim, imply, or appear to involve the university, unless
such actions are part of their official university duties and within the scope of
their employment. The board of trustees and president will specifically delegate
in writing those employees with such signatory authority to contractually
commit the university.
(b) University employees are prohibited from entering into a contract (other than their
employment contract) or lease (other than by student employees for student
housing) with the university, whether or not the contract or lease derived in
whole or part by university funds, except as otherwise provided by law.
(c) No university employee, in their official capacity, in a position to approve or
influence a contract or lease may enter into such a contract or lease which
involves the university employees' family members, business associates, or any
organization with which the university employee is associated whether or not
the contract or lease derived in whole or in part from university funds. It is the
duty of each university employee to disclose promptly any such proposed
contract, lease, or similar relationship or agreement to the university through the
department chair or equivalent immediate supervisor as defined in paragraph
(H)(5) of this rule.
(20) Maintaining the university as a community of scholars requires the free and open
exchange of ideas and the results of scholarly activities. To this end:
(a) University students and scholars involved in research have the right to pursue
topics of interest, have access to available information and facilities, and to
communicate the results of their work in accordance with the law and university
policies.
(b) University employees with outside business interests or outside consulting
activities must ensure that the activities of university students, staff, post

 3359-11-17

8

doctoral fellows, visiting scholars, and other employees are not exploited by
those outside interests and activities.
(c) All university employees have a right to know the source(s) of funding that
support their work.
(21) Employee pursuit of a degree, when presenting a situation in which a possible
conflict of interest or conflict of commitment could reasonably be thought to exist
requires prior approval by the employee's immediate supervisor.
(22) No university employee may give or accept anything of value that may substantially
or improperly influence him or her with respect to his or her university duties.
(23) The university seal, logo, trademarks, and all other university intellectual property
may not be used by any person, including any university employee outside his or her
scope of employment; not by any firm, corporation, or other entity without the
express written permission of the president or the president's designee.
(24) The university's name will not be used by any employee for the purpose of
advertising outside the scope of one's employment by the university or in relation to
commercial ventures for private financial gain. In situations when it is not clear
whether or not the use of the university's name is appropriate, the employee must
obtain the written permission of the president.
(25) All equipment, apparatus, museum materials, scientific collections, books, and other
university property are in the immediate care of the university employees of the
respective departments to which such materials belong. University employees are
expected to practice good stewardship in the use and care of university property.
(26) Nepotism is an impermissible conflict of interest as defined in paragraph (HG)(5) of
this rule.
(a) No university employee may participate, formally or informally, in the decision to
hire, retain, grant tenure to, promote, determine salary of, discipline, renew,
modify or terminate a family member's individual employment with the
university, or to renew, modify, or terminate any other condition of
employment.
(b) No university employee may give preferential or favored treatment in the
supervision or management of another university employee who is a family
member.
(c) No university employee may authorize or use his or her authority, formally or
informally, to secure authorization of any public contract in which he or she or a
family member has an interest.
(27) Service as an expert witness in any civil or criminal case can be undertaken only

 3359-11-17

9

when there is no conflict of interest or conflict of commitment. If the university is
involved in the case as a named party, there must be prior disclosure and/or
approval.
(28) While executing their university duties, university employees may not use their
authority in an exploitative manner in relationships with others.
(29) A whistle blower, who raises or wishes to raise an allegation against a university
employee/employees, of a conflict of interest and/or conflict of commitment, related
wrongdoing, or of institutional conflict(s) of interest, must respect the confidentiality
of sensitive information and give legitimate institutional structures an opportunity to
resolve the matter. Whistle blowers and other witnesses have the responsibility to
raise their concerns honorably and with foundation. The university has a duty to
undertake review and actions as appropriate and not to tolerate or engage in
retaliation against whistle blowers. This duty includes providing appropriate and
timely relief to ameliorate the consequences of actual or threatened reprisals, and
holding accountable those who retaliate.
(30) Responsibilities of the department chair or equivalent are:
(a) To maintain a record of any outside activity disclosed by a university employee
under his/her direction.
(b) To act in good faith to assist the university in implementation of this policy.
(c) To convey to the dean or administrative supervisor the concerns they, or others,
have with this policy.

include actions recommended by the dean to manage or remediate the
conflict(s).
(32) The office of research administration under this policy is responsible for providing
employees with the annual reporting form for each eligible employee under their
supervision.
(C) Procedures for reports, certifications, disclosures, and approvals.
(1) Disclosures and requests for approvals are to be directed first to the immediate
administrative supervisor, as well as to the next higher level.
(2) Regardless of whether the disclosure is disallowed or approved, the completed reports
are to be sent to the employee's immediate supervisor for preapproval. The
employee's immediate supervisor will forward the report to his/her immediate
supervisor (i.e., college dean, division chair) for preapproval who will, in turn,
forward the report to the appropriate central administrative officer (i.e., executive
vice president and chief administrative officer) for final review and approval or
denial. Forwarded annual disclosure reports will be kept in the appropriate central
administrative office. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit
disclosures required as defined in paragraph (B)(17) of this rule For a matter of
disallowed approval a department chair or equivalent will communicate a report and
recommendation to the intermediate supervisor. If the intermediate supervisor
confirms the disallowance, he or she will communicate the report and
recommendation to the senior research officer. In the event the senior research
officer determines that the matter may be managed effectively and the management

chief operating officer or office of general counsel.
(3) Procedure for determination in potential conflict situations when initiated by the
senior research officer, senior vice president and provost and chief operating officer,
president.
(a) The senior research officer, senior vice president and provost and chief operating
officer, president, or board of trustees may initiate a review without a written
report when, in their judgment, there is sufficient concern to warrant it. The
senior research officer will inform all appropriate administrators, as well as the
faculty or staff who are subject to this investigation. The senior research officer
will submit to the provost a recommendation for resolution of the conflict.
Additional or subsequent action may be recommended by the provost or office
of general counsel.
(b) The senior research officer will convey promptly to the provost any concerns or
those raised by others related to matters covered by this policy. The senior
research officer will forward to the general counsel a copy of any request for

supply the names of any individuals or entities that could supply information
helpful to their position or to the full and complete investigation of the matter.

 3359-11-17

13

The individual who is charged may be accompanied by legal counsel or other
advisor during interviews with the committee and/or individual members of the
committee. The role of counsel or other advisor is limited to observation and
advising his/her client on responding to questions.
(d) At this time the subject of investigation will be responsible for all fees or
expenses in his/her defense of allegations.
(2) Although a whistleblower enjoys a privilege to report allegations of misconduct, the
office of research integrity states (position paper #1, the whistleblower's conditional
privilege to report allegations of scientific misconduct, 1993), that abuse of the
privilege may leave the whistleblower liable for defamation. In addition, this may
subject a whistleblower who abuses the privilege to administrative action by the
university as defined in paragraph (GF)(11) of this rule. If the allegation of
misconduct by the whistleblower proves unfounded, the university should take
specific steps for redress of the rights of the unjustly subject of investigation.
Among compensatory actions:
(a) The university will become responsible for the defense expenses of the subject of
investigation, if so ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) The subject of investigation will be given the option to take legal action when
appropriate, interview any identified witness(es) and review any and all
documentation that might have a bearing on the outcome of the investigation.
(c) The university will report to appropriate federal or state agencies and university
officials in accordance with federal and state requirements.
(3) If a university employee is indeed found to have violated university policy or to have
violated the terms of a memorandum of understanding or other terms which were
required by the university in order to manage or eliminate a potential conflict of
interest or conflict of commitment, the provost, in consultation with the senior
research officer, the dean or administrative supervisor, the general counsel, and the
inquiry committee, may recommend to the president one or more of the following
disciplinary sanctions, for action by the university board of trustees:
(a) Formal reprimand.
(b) Suspension from the university for a definite period.
(c) Dismissal from the university.
(d) Other remedial, corrective, or other action which is deemed appropriate.
(4) Illegal acts under this policy may also be subject to prosecution by state and/or federal

 3359-11-17

14

authorities separate from any university disciplinary sanctions. A university
employee may appeal a negative decision and/or disciplinary sanctions in writing to
the president, with a copy to the provost, within fifteen days of receipt of the notice
of the decision. The president will consider the appeal in consultation with the
inquiry committee; chair, dean or administrative supervisor, senior research officer,
and/or provost as he or she deems appropriate; and with the general counsel and any
other upper management that he or she deems appropriate. The president will
provide a decision on the appeal to the employee with a copy to the provost and
general counsel, within thirty days of receiving the appeal. The decision of the
president will be final, subject to the approval of the board of trustees.
(5) In cases of allegation/accusation of wrongdoing, if as a result of this investigation the
allegations are found without merit, the matter will be expunged from all personnel
records of the subject of investigation, and the allegation/accusation files will be
sealed and delivered to the custody of the office of general counsel. The university
recognizes its responsibility to report promptly to those involved, in public and/or in
private as may be appropriate, those allegations which prove to be unsubstantiated
or substantiated.
(6) All proceedings and actions should be conducted in conformity with Revised Code
and code of federal regulations. If it becomes apparent during the course of any
review, inquiry, or investigation that there is illegal conduct or activity and/or that
the conduct indicated or complained of may be criminal in nature, the university's
general counsel will be immediately notified and provided all information and
documentation gathered during the investigatory process to date. The decision of
how the investigation should proceed, whether the investigation is taken over by the
general counsel or whether outside authorities, including police or other law
enforcement agencies, should be notified and involved will be determined by the
general counsel. Criminal investigations, when necessary, take precedence over
normal university academic or advisory reviews. Sequencing of all other reviews
which may be needed will be coordinated among the senior research officer,
provost, general counsel, and president.
(7) If a violation of this policy involves a collateral proceeding under university policies
regarding scholarly misconduct, then the provost will defer a final decision on
sanctions until the scholarly misconduct inquiry and/or investigation process is also
completed.
(8) The detailed documentation of any allegation/accusation, investigation, and
determination will be maintained by the office of general counsel of the university
for at least three years from the date of the determination, from the date of
acceptance of a final report by the federal office of research integrity or any
inspector(s) general involved, or at least three years from the termination date of any
related grant or contract, whichever date is later. Documentation must be provided
when required by law or upon request to authorized government authorities.

(9) Departmental, college, committee, and other university records are to be retained
under suitable confidentiality and may not be destroyed without the permission of
the university's general counsel and the university archivist.
(F) (E) University principles for research and sponsored programs.
(1) The university will deal legally and ethically with external sponsors of research and
sponsored programs in ways that avoid institutional conflicts of interest. The same is
expected of project personnel and sponsors.
(2) The university will not enter into agreements contrary to its mission.
(3) The university will not accept an award for a project that is unacceptable to the
principal investigator. Once an award is accepted by the university, all parties are
expected to fulfill their respective obligations under that agreement.
(4) The university, its faculty, and its students will retain the right to use all data for
research and educational purposes and to publish results in scholarly publications in
accord with university policies. A delay of no more than one year may be mutually
agreed upon to permit patent filings or other legal filings. To restrict student theses
or dissertations from public access for up to one year to permit patent or other legal
filings, a written request must be submitted to the dean of the graduate school along
with the final draft. The dean of the graduate school will then forward all copies of
the thesis or dissertation to the university archivist with a request to withhold it from
public access and the open library shelves for up to one year.
(5) Meaningful participation of university students in sponsored research is expected.
(6) In all cases, and at a minimum, the university will retain a perpetual, irrevocable,
royalty-free right to practice and use patents, copyrights, all other intellectual
property, information and/or materials resulting from or related to any sponsored
project for research, testing, and educational purposes only.
(7) The university will not enter into activities or agreements which could jeopardize its
nonprofit tax-exempt status or conflict with its required state of Ohio or federal cost
principles and/or accounting methods, including but not limited to United States
code of federal regulations title 2 part 220 regarding federal cost principles for
educational institutions and related administrative or subsequent applicable
governing regulations.
(8) The university will not enter into activities or agreements which could jeopardize its
eligibility to receive federal or state funds.
(9) The university will not enter into contracts which are not to be governed or construed
under Ohio law.
(10) The university will not accept contractual terms that require the university to

 3359-11-17

16

indemnify or hold harmless other parties.
(11) Title to intellectual property rights resulting from sponsored projects is to vest with
the university. Any transfer of these rights to non-governmental entities is subject to
specific approval by the board of trustees of the university. An option or a license
may be negotiated in good faith and under reasonable terms and rates to share rights
through a license with the sponsor, on a non-exclusive, exclusive-by-field-of-use, or
similarly limited basis.
(12) The university will not enter into agreements in which the names of the parties or the
facts and terms of the agreement cannot be revealed, but the specific topic of the
research may be kept confidential.
(13) The university will not make any warranties, express or implied, including but not
limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
(14) The university prohibits use of its name or marks or intellectual property by another
without its specific prior written permission.
(15) The university will take title to all equipment and supplies acquired under any
sponsored agreement, unless covered under a specific and separate written
agreement executed by an authorized representative of the university and that
sponsor.
(16) The university routinely utilizes the personal services of university employees,
visiting professionals, students and others who may not be United States citizens or
permanent resident aliens of the United States. Sponsoring or collaborating agencies
must assume responsibility for inquiry and/or waivers, in advance of entering into
any agreement with the university, under the federal export administration
regulations, international traffic in arms regulations, and/or similar or subsequent
regulations concerning participation in research by or dissemination of data to
foreign nationals.
(G) (F) Policies and procedures governing scholarly misconduct.
(1) While encouraging freedom of inquiry, the university of Akron is committed to the
scientific method and the ethical conduct of research. Scholarly misconduct by
employees, visiting scholars, or students in research and scholarship broadly
construed as applying to scientific experimentation, artistic expression, and all other
areas of scholarship in any disciplines not in the spirit of the mission of the
university and therefore is not acceptable. The scholarly misconduct policy governs
any type of research or scholarship that is publicly disseminated, either by
presentation (formal or informal) or publication.
(2) Investigations of alleged scholarly misconduct are conducted within the scope of the
law and limited to the discovery of information that would support or refute the

 3359-11-17

17

allegation. Adverse findings may provide grounds for disciplinary action, up to and
including dismissal from the university.
(3) Inquiry and investigation procedures for scholarly misconduct relating to
university-related research or scholarship that is publicly disseminated.
(a) Reports of alleged scholarly misconduct may be submitted in writing to, and will
be investigated under the direction of, the senior research officer. In addition,
the senior research officer, the provost, the president, or board of trustees may
themselves initiate such an investigation without a written allegation.
(b) Investigations of alleged scholarly misconduct are conducted by an impartial
inquiry committee formed by the senior research officer. The inquiry committee
is advised by the office of the general counsel. Members of the inquiry
committee are individuals with no real or potential conflict of interest with
regard to the alleged misconduct, and with the necessary background to
investigate it.
(c) If the subject of investigation is an employee or assignee of an academic unit, the
inquiry committee consists of two full-time faculty members from the college of
primary appointment of the subject of investigation and one full-time faculty
member from each of three different colleges or universities.
(d) If the subject of investigation is not an employee or assignee of an academic unit,
the inquiry committee consists of two members appointed by the vice president
to whom the subject of investigation reports and three members appointed by
the senior research officer.
(e) The composition of the inquiry committee is not necessarily limited to university
of Akron employees.
(f) The subject of the investigation may object to the selection of specific members,
with foundation, in writing to the senior research officer.
(g) Inquiry committee chairs are elected by the committee. If the subject of
investigation is a faculty member, the chair's primary appointment must be in a
different college.
(h) If the inquiry raises questions about the protection of human subjects, ethical
animal care and use, radiation safety, biohazards, and/or campus safety, the
inquiry committee will contact the appropriate university standing committee
for assistance. At the request of the inquiry committee or the senior research
officer, a member of each appropriate standing committee may be added as an
ex-officio but non-voting member of the inquiry committee.
(4) The guidelines for the operation of the inquiry committee are as follows:

 3359-11-17

18

(a) The work of the inquiry committee is divided into two processes. The process that
occurs first is the preliminary review of charges of scholarly misconduct to
determine if a charge of misconduct will stand. The second process that may
occur is a formal investigation of charges of scholarly misconduct.
(b) When charges of scholarly misconduct are filed against an individual the senior
research officer notifies the individual of the substance of the charges in writing.
(c) The inquiry committee conducts interviews with appropriate individuals and
collects relevant information. The senior research officer provides the
committee with all information provided to him/her in the filing of the charge.
The provost or senior research officer shall provide assistance and support to the
inquiry committee when requested.
(d) The individual who is charged may be accompanied by legal counsel or other
advisor during interviews with the committee and/or individual members of the
committee. The role of counsel or other advisor is limited to observation and
advising his/her client on responding to questions.
(e) After collection, review, and discussion of factual information, the committee
submits a written report of their findings to the senior research officer and the
individual charged with one of two recommendations:
(i) The charges are without merit and the matter should be expunged from all
personnel records of the individual charged and the files of the committee
sealed and delivered to general counsel or
(ii) The charges have merit and warrant a formal investigation.
(f) The written report of the committee following the preliminary review must be
completed within thirty days of the notification of charges to the individual by
the senior research officer. The formal investigation must begin within fifteen
days from the completion of the preliminary review. A written report of the
formal investigation must be completed and submitted to the senior research
officer within sixty days of the notification of the charges to the individual.
(g) Written reports of the committee must contain evidence reviewed, summaries of
all interviews conducted, and the conclusion/recommendation of the committee.
(h) The senior research officer provides a copy of the committee's report(s) to the
individual charged.
(i) The individual charged can provide written comments on the proceedings of the
committee and these comments become part of the permanent records of the
committee's proceedings.
(j) If the recommendation of the committee, at the conclusion of the preliminary

 3359-11-17

19

inquiry, is that the charges are without merit and the matter should be expunged
from the personnel records of the individual charged and the senior research
officer does not agree with this recommendation, the senior research officer
informs the provost of such and directs the committee to begin a formal
investigation of the charges.
(k) The individual charged must be notified in writing that a formal investigation is to
be conducted. This notification includes details of the charges of misconduct,
summary of the general nature of the evidence supporting the charges, and
statements as to the rights of the individual charged to i) have a hearing, ii)
confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, iii) be heard in person and iv)
present witnesses and documentary evidence, and to have legal counsel at his or
her expense with the same limitations as in the preliminary review.
(l) If a formal investigation is to be held, the senior research officer or designee takes
appropriate administrative actions to protect federal funds and to ensure that the
purposes of any federal financial assistance is being carried out. The federal
office of research integrity, located within the national institutes of health of the
public health service, is notified that an investigation is being conducted.
(i) The subject of investigation may have private legal counsel, but the role of the
subject of investigation employee's legal counsel will be limited in the same
manner as in the initial inquiry.
(ii) The inquiry committee will inform the senior research officer, who will
promptly notify the federal office of research integrity of:
(a) Any reasonable indication of possible criminal violation.
(b) Any developments during the investigation that disclose facts that may
affect current or potential federal funding for the individual(s) under
investigation or facts that the federal agency needs to know to ensure
appropriate use of federal funds and otherwise protect the public
interest.
(iii) In executive session the inquiry committee will seek, examine, and evaluate
all relevant facts, including but not limited to the charges, consider any
written responses to the charges by the subject of investigation, report by
experts, advice of consultants, etc. However, the subject of investigation has
the right to request a public hearing or a private hearing before the
committee at which time the subject of investigation will have the right to
present any explanation or rebuttal, to question any complainant, and to
question the committee.
(iv) For allegations substantiated by the formal proceedings, the senior research
officer will inform appropriate funding agencies of the allegations and

 3359-11-17

20

findings regarding the scholarly misconduct.
(v) The senior research officer will report findings and recommend further action
to the provost.
(vi) The provost may recommend to the president one or more of the following
disciplinary sanctions, for action by the university board of trustees:
(a) Formal reprimand.
(b) Suspension from the university for a definite period.
(c) Dismissal from the university.
(d) Other remedial, corrective, or other action that is deemed appropriate.
(vii) Illegal acts may also be subject to prosecution by state and/or federal
authorities.
(viii) A university employee may appeal a negative decision and/or disciplinary
sanctions in writing to the president, with a copy to the provost, within
fifteen days of receipt of the notice of the decision. The president may
consider the case in consultation with the committee, senior research officer,
provost, chair, dean or administrative supervisor, as he/she deems
appropriate; and with the general counsel. The president will provide a
decision on the appeal to the subject of investigation, with copy to the
provost, senior research officer, and the general counsel, within thirty days
of receiving the appeal.
(ix) The decision of the president will be final, subject to the approval of the
board of trustees.
(5) If, as a result of this investigation the allegations are found without merit, the matter
will be expunged from all current personnel records of the subject of investigation,
and the accusation file will be sealed and delivered to the custody of the office of
general counsel.
(6) The university will report promptly to those involved, in public and/or in private as
may be appropriate, those allegations that prove to be unsubstantiated and those
allegations that are substantiated.
(7) If it becomes apparent during the course of any review, inquiry, or investigation that
there are illegal issues and/or that the conduct indicated or complained of may be
criminal in nature, the university's general counsel should be immediately notified
and provided all information and documentation gathered during the investigatory
process to date. The decision of how the investigation should proceed will be
determined by the general counsel. Criminal investigations take precedence over

 3359-11-17

21

normal university academic or advisory reviews. Sequencing of any other reviews
will be coordinated among the senior research officer, provost, general counsel, and
president.
(8) If a violation of this policy involves a collateral proceeding under university policies
regarding a conflict of interest or conflict of commitment, then the senior research
officer will institute the conflict of interest and/or conflict of commitment review(s),
but the provost will defer a final decision or sanctions on that matter until the
scholarly misconduct inquiry and/or investigation procedure is completed.
(9) The detailed documentation of any allegation, accusation, inquiry, investigation, and
determination will be maintained by the office of general counsel of the university
for at least three years from the date of determination, date of acceptance of a final
report if any from the federal office of research integrity and/or any inspector(s)
general involved, or at least three years from the termination of any related grant or
contract, whichever date is later. Documentation must be provided when required by
law or upon request of authorized government authorities.
(a) Departmental, college, committee, and other university records are to be retained
confidentially to the extent permitted by law and may not be destroyed without
the permission of the university's general counsel and the university archivist.
(10) A whistleblower who raises or wishes to raise an allegation against a university
employee of scholarly or scientific misconduct or related wrongdoing must respect
the confidentiality of sensitive information and give legitimate institutional
structures an opportunity to function in resolution of the matter. Whistleblowers and
other witnesses have responsibility to raise their concerns honorably and only with
foundation. The university has a duty to undertake review and actions as appropriate
and not to tolerate or engage in retaliation against good-faith whistleblowers. This
duty includes providing appropriate and timely relief to ameliorate the consequences
of actual or threatened reprisals, and holding accountable those who retaliate.
Although a whistleblower enjoys a privilege to report allegations of misconduct, the
office of research integrity states (position paper #1, the whistleblower's conditional
privilege to report allegations of scientific misconduct, 1993), that abuse of the
privilege may leave the whistleblower liable for defamation. In addition, this may
subject a whistleblower who abuses the privilege to administrative action by the
university.

some of the policies, procedures, instructions, and traditions may be regarded also as

(a) Extended circulation periods and other instructional support services in university
libraries.
(b) Fee parking in specially designated university parking areas.
(c) Medical, dental, life, and long-term disability insurance in accordance with article
18 of the collective bargaining agreement between the university of Akron and
Akron-AAUP; contributions, if required, on a pre-tax basis at an amount
periodically approved by the board of trustees.
(d) Sick leave.
(e) Membership in an Ohio retirement system.
(f) Identification card. All full-time faculty members are issued photo-identification
cards.
(2) College lecturers are not eligible for the faculty improvement leave program as
defined in rule 3359-11-04 of the Administrative Code.
(3) Other privileges and benefits are listed below:
(a) Athletic and cultural events. Faculty members are granted half-price admission to
all university athletic events and special rates for certain cultural events.
(b) Recreation and fitness. The swimming pool has periods of open swimming for
faculty members and their families. Faculty members are also welcome to
participate in all intramural competitions--bowling, softball, volleyball, and
others. Wellness and supervised exercise programs are available to all faculty
and staff.
(c) Credit union. All faculty members are eligible for membership in the Akron
teachers' credit union. Payroll deductions may be made to the credit union's
savings plan.
(d) The bookstore at the university of Akron. Faculty members may purchase books
and other supplies through the bookstore, ordinarily at a discount.
(e) Notary public. Notary service is available by appointment in the office of general
counsel at no cost to faculty members.

 3359-20-06.2

annuity plan, is in conformity with current provisions of the internal revenue
code.
(ii) The university will accept an employee's voluntary authorization to divert a
portion of current compensation to the purchase of an annuity contract, the
purchase to be made through the university, but in the name of the
employee. Compensation diverted to the purchase of an annuity is
excludable from the employee's taxable income, for federal and state
income tax purposes, in the current year, but is taxed when received as
income from the annuity at the tax rates in effect at that time. Internal
revenue has placed a limitation on the amount of current compensation
excludable from taxable income. A voluntary diversion of compensation to
purchase an annuity does not reduce the current base for local income tax,
retirement deduction, or premiums paid by the university for insurance and
workers' compensation.
(iii) A current list of companies qualified to provide annuities for university
faculty and staff may be obtained from the university vice president for
finance and administration.

(i) Fee reductions for university faculty and administrative officers:

(i) Credit courses. Any college lecturer shall be permitted to take two
credit courses or six credit hours, whichever is greater, each
semester and each summer session, free of all charges, including
instructional and general fees, graduate level, laboratory, or other
fees. Unused portions of these reductions are not cumulative.
(ii) Non-credit courses. Any college lecturer shall be permitted to take
two non-credit courses per semester (i.e., combined summer I and
II, fall, spring), which shall not affect eligibility for credit fee
remission enrollment.
Some courses are not available for students using non-credit course
fee reduction (AutoCAD, 'Microsoft NT," polymer science courses,
etc.). A list of such courses will be maintained by the division of
continuing education.

 3359-20-06.2

8

placed on a waiting list in the division of workforce development

law credit hour fees for Ohio residents shall be deducted from total fee
charges for the following groups (general fees, music non-credit
courses, and other special fees not being affected):
(i) Unmarried and dependent children of all college lecturers while the
parent is in the service of the university of Akron.

the university of Akron. Spouses of college lecturers who are also

spouse.

college lecturers who have a minimum of ten years of continuous
service and who were serving the university of Akron at the time of

 3359-20-06.2

9

(iv) Spouses and unmarried and dependent children of all retired college
lecturers who retire with a minimum of ten academic years of
continuous service.
(v) For purposes of fee reductions:
(A) Spouses refer to individuals who have contracted the legal status
of a marital relationship through religious or civil solemnized

 THE UNIVERSITY OF AKRON
Term Sheet
The University of Akron
and
Dr. Gary L. Miller

The University of Akron (the “University”) and Dr. Gary L. Miller (“Dr. Miller” or
“President”), enter into this Term Sheet (the “Term Sheet”) as of this 14th day of August,
2019, for the employment as President of the University. A definitive President’s
Employment Agreement (the “Agreement”) containing these terms subsequently shall be
negotiated and executed. Both this Term Sheet and the Agreement shall be subject to formal
approval by the University’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”).

Terms
1.

Dr. Miller shall serve as President of The University of Akron, subject to the applicable
provisions of Ohio law and rules and regulations of the University and the Board,
including but not limited to O.A.C. 3359-01-05. He shall be the chief executive officer
for the University and shall serve as President under the supervision, and at the
discretion of the Board.

2.

The President's employment shall commence on October 1, 2019, unless otherwise
modified by agreement of the Parties (the “Effective Date”) and continue for a term of
five (5) years thereafter (the “Term”), consistent with the terms and incentives of the
Agreement. Any subsequent extension or term, and the associated details thereof, shall
be determined by a mutual written agreement of both Parties.

3.

During the Term,
a.

The President shall be provided with a base compensation of $475,000 annually
(the “Base Compensation”), subject to applicable taxes and withholdings,
which shall be subject to annual review by the Board and may be increased
during the Term of the Agreement at the sole discretion of the Board.

b.

The University shall establish and maintain for the benefit of the President a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under section 457(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code (the “457(f) Plan”). The University shall credit this Plan with $25,000 during
each year of the Agreement, provided that the President has remained continuously
employed by the University through the end of such year, during the Term of the
Agreement. All accrued deferred compensation that the University has credited to
the 457(f) Plan shall become fully vested and payable to the President in a single
1

 lump sum payment upon completion of the Term. If the President‘s employment
terminates for any reason before the completion of the Term, other than because of
death, permanent disability or termination without cause by the University, the
President shall forfeit all of the accrued deferred compensation and shall not be paid
any of the accrued deferred compensation.
c.

The President shall be responsible for any federal, state or local income tax
liability incurred that result from payments made as compensation or benefits
to the President pursuant to the Agreement.

4.

The President shall be a member of the administrative faculty with rank, untenured, of the
University. He shall be entitled to any and all standard benefits, subject to the terms and
conditions of the appropriate plan or policy, provided to administrative faculty with rank,
untenured, including: health insurance (dental, medical, prescription, vision and worker’s
compensation); life insurance; disability programs; retirement benefits (as elected by the
President under applicable Ohio law) under either the applicable Ohio public retirement
system or Alternative Retirement Plan (“ARP”); tax-deferred savings plans (including the
University’s 403(b) plan and 457(b) plan); flexible spending accounts; vacation and sick
leave; and fee remission.

5.

The University shall reimburse the President for reasonable moving and relocation
expenses up to an amount of $36,000, such reimbursement to be consistent with the
University’s policies concerning moving expenses. Moving and relocation expenses are
eligible for reimbursement if incurred within twelve (12) months of the Effective Date.

6.

During the Term of the Agreement, the University shall provide to the President a stipend
of $750 per month to be applied toward an automobile. Any automobile expense balance,
as well as any liability, collision, and comprehensive insurance and all additional
operational expenses associated with said automobile, shall be procured and borne by the
President.

7.

During the Term of the Agreement, the University shall provide to the President a stipend
of $3,500 per month to be applied toward housing. Any housing expense balance, as well
as any liability and comprehensive insurance and all additional operational expenses
associated with said housing, including any and all repairs, shall be procured and borne by
the President.

8.

The Board will provide the President, at the University's expense, with a family
membership at one mutually agreed upon country club in the name of (or on behalf of) the
University and shall pay monthly dues and expenses as provided under Board rules. The
parties acknowledge and agree that based upon substantiation of information to be provided
by the President, the University shall include in the President's compensation for income
tax purposes only the value attributable to the President's non-business (i.e. personal) uses
of such club. The President agrees to maintain and furnish an accounting of expenses
provided for in this Agreement in accord with standard requirements of the University.

 9.

It is expected that the President shall, from time-to-time utilize facilities on the main
campus or elsewhere, including the President’s residence, to (1) entertain various
individuals, including but not limited to dignitaries, community leaders, faculty and
other employee groups, students and student groups, friends of the University, and
political leaders; and (2) to hold receptions, meetings, fund-raising activities, and a
variety of events for mixed business and social purposes benefiting the interests of the
University. In such instances, reasonable cooking, catering, and/or housekeeping
services shall be provided to, and/or reimbursed by the University at the President's
request.

10.

The President shall be provided with a reasonable budget for staffing, entertainment and
other resources necessary for the operation of the Office of the President to carry out the
University’s development objectives as determined by the Board of Trustees. The
President shall be provided with necessary equipment (i.e. computer, printer, etc.) to
operate an office at the President’s personal residence.

11.

Travel, lodging, meals and other expenses (including reimbursement for mileage)
incurred in connection with University business by the President and his spouse shall
be reimbursed in accordance with University policy. If the President requests his
spouse to utilize her skills and talents in connection with a University-related activity
and for the direct benefit of the University, such efforts will be on a voluntary, unpaid
basis; however, expenses incurred in connection with such University-related activity
by the President’s spouse shall be reimbursed in accordance with University policy.

12.

The President may serve on one or more external, charitable or similar board positions
with the prior express approval of the Board of Trustees.

13.

As a condition of employment as President, and within ninety (90) days of the Effective
Date of employment, Dr. Miller shall have a comprehensive physical examination by a
licensed physician, mutually agreed upon by the parties. The cost of the examination and
all tests and procedures related to the examination shall be borne by the University. A
certification of his fitness for duty shall be submitted to the Board of Trustees.

14.

Upon termination of the Agreement and/or completion of the Term, the University shall
have no further obligation to the President, except as otherwise specifically required under
the Agreement. Should the President resign his position prior to the completion of the
Term other than for disability, the President will be subject to a liquidated damages clause.

15.

This Term Sheet and the resulting Agreement shall be subject to the applicable
provisions of Chapter 3345 of the Ohio Revised Code, including the performance
evaluation, suspension of authority, duties and pay, and termination provisions
required by Ohio Revised Code Section 3345.77. The Board shall conduct annual
performance evaluations and shall include discussions of same with the President. The
President shall provide such oral and written reports as may be required by the Board
to aid in conducting such job performance reviews. The President shall comply with
all provisions of Ohio's Ethics Laws.
3

 16.

Payment under this Term Sheet or subsequent Agreement is subject to appropriation
of funds by the Ohio Legislature and to the determination of the adequacy of such
funds for that purpose by the Board of Trustees. However, the Parties agree and
understand that funding for the University comes from several sources other than
appropriations by the State of Ohio. It is not the intent of the Board of Trustees to use
any reduction in appropriations as a reason to reduce compensation under this Term
Sheet or subsequent Agreement if other funds are available for such use.

17.

The Parties agree to prepare and sign an Agreement, which shall include under
what conditions the Board of Trustees may terminate the Agreement “for cause”
and “without cause,” and under which the President may terminate the Agreement,
with and without incurring a financial penalty. However, the Parties intend to be
bound, and are bound, by the terms of this Term Sheet, until such time as it is
replaced by the Agreement or is amended or superseded by a further written
agreement signed by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the University
may terminate this Term Sheet, without any further liability or obligation
thereunder, if the President is found to have engaged in any one or more of the
following before the Agreement is in place: (a) acts or omissions of gross negligence
or willful malfeasance in the performance of duties as President; (b) conviction of a
felony, or a guilty or no contest plea to a felony charge; (c) acts or omissions that
materially harm or reflect negatively upon the University undertaken or omitted
knowingly; (d) material misrepresentation of credentials or background; or, (e) a
knowing and material violation of Ohio Ethics Laws. This “for cause” provision
shall be replaced by a mutually-agreed provision in the Agreement.
