property within this Plan will facilitate ?nancing of environmental response and other
eligible activities at eligible properties, and will also provide tax incentives to eligible
taxpayers willing to invest in revitalization of eligible sites, commonly referred to as
?brown?elds.? By facilitating redevelopment of brownfield properties, this Plan is
intended to promote economic growth for the bene?t of the residents of the City and all
taxing units located within and bene?ted by the DBRA.

This Plan is intended to apply to the eligible property identi?ed in this Plan and, if tax
increment revenues are proposed to be captured from that eligible property, to identify and
authorize the eligible activities to be funded by such tax increment revenues.

This Plan is intended to be a living document, which may be modi?ed or amended in
accordance with the requirements of Act 381, as necessary to achieve the purposes of Act
381. The identi?cation or designation of a developer or proposed use of the eligible
property shall not necessitate an amendment to this Plan, affect the application of this Plan
to the eligible property or impair the rights available to the DBRA under this Plan. The
applicable sections of Act 381 are noted throughout the Plan for reference purposes.

This Plan describes the project to be completed (see Attachment C) and contains all the
information required by Section 13(2) of Act 381.

they include demolition and asbestos abatement, site preparation activities, infrastructure
improvements, and the preparation and implementation of a brown?eld plan and 381 work
plan.

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity intended
to be paid for with tax increment revenues (as de?ned by Section 2(ss) of Act 381) from
the Property are shown in the table attached hereto as Attachment E. The eligible activities
described in Attachment are not exhaustive. Subject to the approval of DBRA staff in

Exhibit A
Proposed Chemical Bank Headquarters
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall commence
within eighteen (18) months after the date the governing body approves this Plan and be
completed within three (3) years after approval of the Michigan Strategic Fund work plan,
if applicable, or three (3) years after execution of the Reimbursement Agreement (as that
term is defined below). Any long-term monitoring or operation and maintenance activities
or obligations that may be required will be performed in compliance with the terms of this
Plan and any documents prepared pursuant to this Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities incurred by it as
described below. Some eligible activities may commence prior to the adoption of this Plan
and to the extent permitted by Act 381 shall be reimbursable pursuant to the
Reimbursement Agreement. Tax increment revenue generated by the Property will be
captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible activities completed
on the Property pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by
the DBRA and the Developer after approval of this Plan (the ?Reimbursement
Agreement?), to the extent permitted by Act 381. In the event this Plan contemplates the
capture of tax increment revenue derived from ?taxes levied for school operating purposes?
(as defined by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and hereinafter referred to as ?School Taxes?), the
Developer acknowledges and agrees that obligation to reimburse the Developer
for the cost of eligible activities with tax increment revenue derived from Local Taxes, or
Specific Taxes that are considered Local Taxes, (as these capitalized terms are de?ned by
Act 381) is contingent upon: the Developer receiving at least the initial applicable work
plan approvals by the Michigan Strategic Fund and the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality, as may be required pursuant to Act 381, within 180 days after the
date this Plan is approved by the governing body, or such other date as the DBRA may
agree to in writing or (ii) the Developer providing the DBRA with evidence, satisfactory
to DBRA, that the Developer has the ?nancial means to complete the project without the
capture of, and subsequent reimbursement with, the contemplated School Taxes.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending on the nature and extent of environmental contamination and other unknown
conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities
encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax increment revenues
of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the Reimbursement
Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be quali?ed for reimbursement except to
the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Reimbursement
Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the
total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement, provided that the total
cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the Reimbursement
Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment B. As long as the
total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be adjusted after the
date this Plan is approved by the governing body, to the extent the adjustments do not
violate the terms of the approved MDEQ or MSF work plan.

Impact of Tax Increment Financing on Taxing Jurisdictions {Section 

This Plan anticipates the capture of tax increment revenues to reimburse the Developer for
the costs of eligible activities under this Plan in accordance with the Reimbursement
Agreement. Subject to Section 13(b)( 16) of Act 381, a table of estimated tax increment
revenues to be captured is attached to this Plan as Attachment F.

 

Tax increment revenues are projected to be captured and applied to reimbursement of
eligible activity costs and payment of DBRA administrative and operating expenses, (ii)

TOTALS $16,700,493* $2,575,672 $1,821,662 $0

In addition, the following taxes are projected to be generated but shall not be captured during
the life of this Plan:

City Debt $3,968,927
School Debt and Judgment $7,370,864
DIA Millages $113,398
Zoo Millages $56,699
Downtown Development $17,822,579
Authority

Total $50,430,293

*The total not to exceed amount requested for approval is $25,000,000. The eligible expenses are well in excess of this amount so should
revenues be available, the developer is requesting up to $25,000,000 be reimbursed.

In no event shall the duration of this Plan exceed thirty??ve (35) years following the date
of the governing body?s resolution approving this Plan, nor shall the duration of the tax
capture exceed the lesser of the period authorized under subsection (3) and (5) of Section
13 of Act 381 or 30 years. Further, in no event shall the beginning date of the capture of

Exhibit A
Proposed Chemical Bank Headquarters
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

tax increment revenues be later than ?ve (5) years after the date of the governing body?s
resolution approving this Plan. The beginning date of the capture of tax increment revenue
shall be the 2022 tax year (commencing with the Summer 2022 property taxes).

The Project is anticipated to have $37,096,150 in eligible expenses; however, it is projected
that only $16,700,493 will be captured and available for reimbursement under this Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, should more tax increment revenue be available
for capture than what is currently projected, the Developer is requesting that $25,000,000
be approved as the maximum reimbursement amount under this Plan. This requested
maximum allowance would ensure that should projected taxable value be higher than
projected or a PA210 tax abatement not approved, the Developer is able to capture
available Tax Increment Revenues.

E. Plan of Financing (Section Maximum Amount oflmlebtetlness (Section
13(211en

The eligible activities are to be ?nanced by the Developer. The DBRA will reimburse the
Developer for the cost of approved eligible activities, but only from tax increment revenues
generated from the Property. No advances have been or shall be made by the City or the
DBRA for the costs of eligible activities under this Plan.

All reimbursements authorized under this Plan shall be governed by the Reimbursement
Agreement. The inclusion of eligible activities and estimates of costs to be reimbursed in
this Plan are intended to authorize the DBRA to fund such reimbursements and does not
obligate the DBRA or the City to fund any reimbursement or to enter into the
Reimbursement Agreement providing for the reimbursement of any costs for which tax
increment revenues may be captured under this Plan, or which are permitted to be
reimbursed under this Plan. The amount and source of any tax increment revenues that
will be used for purposes authorized by this Plan, and the terms and conditions for such
use and upon any reimbursement of the expenses permitted by this Plan, will be provided
solely under the Reimbursement Agreement contemplated by this Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan, the
DBRA shall not incur any note or bonded indebtedness to ?nance the purposes of this Plan.

Interest shall be paid under this Plan as provided in the Reimbursement Agreement,
provided that to the extent that the Michigan Strategic Fund or Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality does not approve the payment of interest on an eligible activity with
school taxes, interest shall not accrue or be paid under this Plan with respect to the cost of
such eligible activity. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the
State of Michigan, the DBRA may approve interest on the local portion of the
reimbursement to the extent that the projected internal rate of return to the Developer does
not exceed twenty as more speci?cally stated in the Reimbursement Agreement.

Reimbursements under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the cost of eligible
activities permitted under this Plan.

Exhibit A
Proposed Chemical Bank Headquarters
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

F. Duration of Plan (Section 

Subject to Section 13b(16) of Act 381, the beginning date of capture of tax increment
revenues for each eligible property shall occur in accordance with the Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) table described in Exhibit F. In no event, however, shall this Plan extend
beyond the maximum term allowed by Section 13(2)(f) of Act 381 for the duration of this
Plan.

Furthermore, this Plan, or any subsequent amendment thereto, may be abolished or
terminated in accordance with Section 14(8) of Act 3 81 in the event of any of the following:

a. The governing body may abolish this Plan (or any subsequent amendment
thereto) when it ?nds that the purposes for which this Plan was established have been
accomplished.

b. The governing body may terminate this Plan (or any subsequent amendment
thereto) if the project for which eligible activities were identi?ed in this Plan (or any
subsequent amendment thereto) fails to occur with respect to the eligible property for at
least two (2) years following the date of the governing body resolution approving this Plan
(or any subsequent amendment thereto), provided that the governing body ?rst does both
of the following: gives 30 days? written notice to the Developer at its last known address
by certi?ed mail or other method that documents proof of delivery attempted; and (ii)
provides the Developer with an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.

Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the contrary, this Plan (or any subsequent
amendment thereto) shall not be abolished or terminated until the principal and interest on
bonds, if any, issued under Section 17 of Act 381 and all other obligations to which the tax
increment revenues are pledged have been paid or funds suf?cient to make the payment
have been identi?ed or segregated.

G. Effective Date of Inclusion in Brownfield Plan
The Property will become a part of this Plan on the date this Plan is approved by the

governing body.

H. Disnlammenti'Rclocation of Individuals on Eligible Property (Section 
No displacement of residents is expected as part of this project. There are no residential
individuals on the Property; however, there are currently two of?ce tenants within the
current building. Developer represents that prior to the Developer taking any action on this
Plan, these tenants had already established plans to relocate into the adjacent building once
their current leases end. An additional lease for the surface parking exists on the Property,
however, this lease contains no contractual option to renew and will expire on its own terms
before Project commencement. Developer represents and warrants that all proper notices

Project Description

Proposed Chemical Bank Headquarters

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Project Synopsis

The proposed Development will create an anchored office space for Chemical Bank?s
new headquarters. The project proposes the demolition of the current building at 25
West Elizabeth Street and surface parking at 2047 Woodward Avenue for the new
construction of a 20 story office building, with ten stories of parking, nine stories of
Class-A office space, and ground floor retail space anticipated to house a bank branch
and potentially an additional retail tenant. Chemical Bank will occupy six to seven
stories within the building and will plan to expand into the remaining floors or the
property will be leased to other office tenants. The entire building is anticipated to
consist of the following estimated square footages:

- Nine floors of office space, totaling approximately 185,000 square feet

. Ten floors of parking, totaling approximately 227,000 square feet

. Ground floor retail, totaling approximately 7,500 square feet

The developer will create a terrace level atop the building, to provide skyline vantage
points and outdoor space for tenants.

Upon completion, this project will replace a functionally obsolete building and bring the
property into a higher use that will support the current market. Creating the space for
up to at least 500 new jobs in the City of Detroit, it will further catalyze economic
development in the area, significantly increasing the daytime foot traffic and consumer
spending in the Central Business District. The project is slated to commence Summer
of 2019 with a completion goal of Fall/Winter of 2021.

Economic Benefit

Upon successful redevelopment, the Development will generate increased income
taxes, through the new jobs and residents that the project will create. It will also create
much needed multi-story parking to service entertainment and sporting events at
nearby venues including the Fillmore Theater, Fox Theater, Comerica Park, and Ford
Field.

On a short term basis, approximately 380 temporary construction jobs will be created
during demolition and new construction activities. The proposed redevelopment
associated with the new headquarters will relocate 300 existing Chemical Bank jobs to
Detroit and is anticipated to create approximately 200 new jobs in Detroit over the next
five years. Chemical Bank anticipates creating an additional 100?200 additional jobs
throughout Michigan, which would total 300-400 new jobs state-wide, as a result of
planned growth which is largely attributable to building its headquarters in Detroit. In
addition, the leased retail and office tenants are anticipated to create additional spin-
off jobs in the City. Chemical Bank is experienced in employing local residents on their
projects and will utilize available City led programs meant to connect them to the local
job seekers and contractors such as the D2D program and 3 Skilled Trades Task Force
to ensure Detroit-based contractors and workers benefit from the redevelopment.

Attachment 
Page 1

The Development is also anticipated to generate new income tax in addition to the jobs
created. Investments in the community such as this that will have positive long-term
effects and secure the vibrancy of the Central Business District. The increase in
banking and tenant based jobs within the building will increase City collected income
tax at a 1.2% rate for non-residents and 2.4% rate for Detroiters.

Project Investment Estimates to Date

Hard Costs: Approximately $71-72 million
Total Costs: Approximately $104 million

Additional Financing Incentives Associated with the Redevelopment

The Developer is also pursuing the following at this time:
. A Commercial Rehabilitation Act (CRA) Tax Exemption (Public Act 210)

Development Team and Company Synopsis

Sterling Group, which has been actively involved for over 25 years and has participated
in some of the regions most significant projects from historic restorations and
renovations to operating in all real estate sectors, is the project developer. Sterling
Group was founded in 1988. Sterling Group is skilled at new construction adaptive
reuse/restoration techniques including the redeveloping of historic or challenged
buildings.

Chemical Bank, the proposed tenant and project partner has also made significant
contributions to growing business in the City of Detroit. In the Marygrove
Neighborhood, just south of Marygrove College, Chemical Bank launched the
Marygrove Renovation Project to assist Detroit homeowners with home renovation
grants and partnered with a local non-profit to development move-in ready homes in
the neighborhood. These efforts help to stabilize the neighborhood by improving
property values and spurring additional development. In addition, Chemical Bank
assisted in the creation of the Detroit Home Mortgage program, designed to enable
banks to lend to qualifying homebuyers when a discrepancy exists between the actual
cost of a home and, often, a lower appraised value. Chemical Bank also provides
various other special lending programs within the City that ensure a path towards home
ownership and rehabilitation in Detroit.

RE: City of Detroit and Chemical Bank

City of Detroit. The services provided by Chemical Bank will include deposit solutions (ACH,
deposits, lockbox, etc.), disbursements as well as online banking. In addition, Chemical Bank
is collaborating with the Of?ce of the Treasury to streamline processes and create ef?ciencies
in the City?s Treasury Operations. The City of Detroit looks forward to a long-standing
relationship with Chemical Bank.

Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Kanalos:

Please receive this letter in eager anticipation of the new development of Chemical Bank?s Headquarters, in
the city of Detroit. The city of Detroit is on a grand economic journey to rebuild not only downtown but
hopefully our neighborhoods as well. Chemical Bank?s commitment to the city of Detroit would include its
national headquarters and also retail, commercial, and residential space. It will offer even more economic
advantage to the citizens of Detroit.

The Chemical Bank organization has made more than just an economic development initiative in our city. We
remain optimistic about the bank?s commitment to offer educational services, financial literacy, and to
increase job opportunities in our city. Chemical Bank and its leadership have a track record of being
community sensitive and involved with neighborhood revitalization, as well as youth educational scholarship
and support. There are unlimited possibilities of having a bank that is not only concerned about product but is
also very clearly concerned about people.

Chemical Bank and its proposed new headquarters, located at 2047 Woodward Ave., serves as a signal to
companies and businesses standing at the brink of whether or not to invest in the city of Detroit. Hopefully this
new entity presenting such a unique opportunity to the city and its people will lead to even enhanced
development from the riverfront to Eight Mile Road. We are in full support of Chemical Bank and what this
opportunity represents. We are pleased for the city of Detroit and its people for the increased opportunities in
the area of economic and community benefits in orderto make a significant difference. If you need any further
information, I am only too pleased to provide the same. I may be reached at (313) 347-2820 or

Yours for Our City,

Ms. Kanalos:

Real Times Media/The Michigan Chronicle is in full support of Chemical Bank?s proposed
development for its new Detroit headquarters located at 2047 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan.

The move of Chemical Bank?s headquarters to Detroit and its subsequent development is an
added value to Detroit?s economy, growth and future progress. With the hundreds of new jobs
and employees moving to Detroit through the potential development, it continues to help
enhance Detroit?s attractiveness to businesses and people across the globe.

Chemical?s new development also opens the doors for newjobs, financial literacy and
education as well as small business, commercial and personal development opportunities. Its
ongoing dedication to the city of Detroit exemplified in its move and the development - will
be an asset to this community. We also believe Chemical Bank has an awareness,
understanding and respect for Detroit?s diversity and will create an infrastructure that
embraces the needs of Detroit citizens, businesses and partners.

As a neighboring business/property owner, we appreciate the inclusion of the community in
the planning processes and are excited to see the economic and community bene?ts of the
new Chemical Bank Detroit headquarters.

Re: 25 W. Elizabeth Street Annex Building and Chemical Bank Mixed Use project
DearJennifer:

On behalf of the Detroit Theatre District Association and the Grand Circus Park Conservancy, please
accept this letter of support for the proposed Chemical Bank Mixed Use project which also involves the
removal of the Elizabeth Street Annex building to allow the new construction. The Elizabeth Street
Annex building (25 W. Elizabeth Street), a 1950 addition to the historic 1922 Grand Park Centre building
(28 W. Adams Street), is a deterrent to the major improvement program of the Chemical Bank Mixed
Use building (2047 Woodward Avenue) that will be of substantial benefit to the community.

The Chemical Bank project solidifies a density of development adjacent to our Theatre District?s
northern edge which extends the substance of the Grand Circus Park Historic District. The stabilization
of the Grand Centre Building through the transfer of the mechanical and electrical systems in the
Chemical Bank project, will allow this major high occupancy facility to continue its contributions to the
Park district.

For the foregoing reasons, I strongly support the proposed Chemical Bank Mixed Use project.

Sincerely

..

Ms. Kanalos,

When I heard of a major bank like Chemical Bank choosing downtown Detroit as its new home, I was extremely
elated. I would like to express my full support for Chemical Bank?s proposed new headquarters located at 2047
Woodward Avenue in the Foxtown neighborhood. The decision to move Chemical Bank?s headquarters to Detroit
and its subsequent development is a signi?cant and historic moment for the economy in the City of Detroit.

I believe Chemical Bank?s attention to the unique needs of Detroit?s Citizens and Stakeholders will prove to be an
invaluable asset that will serve all Detroiters. With its ability to offer ?nancial literacy and educational services,
commercial and personal development opportunities, and an increasing number of jobs in Downtown Detroit.

Chemical Bank?s commitment to the City of Detroit illustrated through the development of its Headquarters will
continue to lift Detroit towards even more success. The Development will also offer additional retail, commercial,
and residential space, offering more economic advantages to its neighbors. As a neighboring business owner we
appreciate the inclusion of the community in the planning process and are excited to see the economic and
community bene?ts of the new Chemical Bank Headquarters. I remain;

Sincerely Yours,

RE: 25 West Elizabeth Street, Detroit, Michigan
Dear Ms. Kanalos:

The Office of the Financial Of?cer, Of?ce of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed project for the property located at 25 West
Elizabeth Street, Detroit, Michigan (the ?Property?) in anticipation of the Property being included in a brown?eld plan.

The Brown?eld Redevelopment Financing Act (?Act 381?) requires that a level or IV assessor make a ?nding that the Property is
?functionally obsolete?, as de?ned by Act 381, and provide the underlying basis for that opinion.

Section 2(s) of Act 381 de?nes ?functionally obsolete? as property that is ?unable to be used to adequately perform the function for
which it was intended due to a substantial loss in value resulting from factors such as overcapacity, changes in technology, de?ciencies
or super adequacies in design, or other similar factors that affect the property itself or the property?s relationship with other surrounding
property.? MCL 

The Assessors Manual de?nes functional obsolescence as ?a loss in value occurring in a structure caused by changes in design,
overcapacity, or inadequacy.? Michigan Assessors Manual, Vol. I Glossary, p. 239.

The Property was originally intended for of?ce use over the above ground parking structure, and without substantial updates and
renovations, the Property is not able to meet market demand for its future of?ce use for several reasons, including, but not limited to:
existing electrical and mechanical systems are severely antiquated and the cost to replace/update these systems is extremely cost
prohibitive; elevator systems must be updated and brought up to code; utilities for the Property are not energy ef?cient and the cost to
update would be cost prohibitive; interior ?nishes have been stripped and are in need of signi?cant repair; column placement on many
?oors impact the functionality of the space and ?oor plans and overall building design does not support maximal utility or modern
demands; above ground garage is need of repair and presence of asbestos which must be remediated.

The Finance Department Assessment Division ?nds the Property to be functionally obsolete within the de?nition of the Assessors
Manual and the Brown?eld Redevelopment Financing Act.

1. What is the plan for hiring Detroiters?

The development team has presented at a D2D session following determination of the bid needs and procedures to
obtain Detroit?based contractors for this project. The development team plans to also present at a Skilled Trades Task
Force, to assist in connecting with additional Detroiters for the project. The development team is committed to the City
of Detroit. Sterling Group has operated within the City for a long time and is committed pursuing local workforce
trades.

Sterling Group and Chemical Bank will work closely with DEGC to ensure job opportunities are created for Detroit
residents and that they will be included in the planning processes of the project.

2. Please give a detailed description of the jobs available as listed in the above chart, i.e: job type, job
quali?cations, etc.

In the short-term, approximately 275 construction jobs are anticipated to be created. The proposed
redevelopment associated with the new headquarters will relocate 300 existing jobs and is anticipated to create
an additional 200-300 jobs in the city of Detroit over the next five years. Chemical Bank anticipates creating 100-
200 additional jobs throughout Michigan.

The Construction jobs will consist of;

Abatement Asbestos workers

Demolition - Laborers

Workers, Roofers, Painters, Tile Setters

. Elevators Elevator Constructors

. Fire Protection Pipe Fitters

- Mechanical Pipe Fitters, Sheet Metal Workers

- Plumbing - Plumbers

- Electrical Electricians

3. Will this development cause any relocation that will create new Detroit residents?

This development is not anticipated to cause any relocation as existing tenants have plans to establish
leases in the adjacent building once current leases expire. The creation of approximately 500 new positions
in the City will likely result in the retention of or creation of new residents (estimated at a retained 300 jobs
and up to 200-300 new jobs)

4. Has the developer reached out to any community groups to discuss the project and/or any potential
jobs?
Yes. We have discussed with the DEGC the need to participate in their D2D program. The development
team has presented at a D2D session January 2019 to ensure Detroit-based contractors and workers bene?t

from the project. Support letters have also been received by nearby businesses such as the Detroit Theater
District Business Association, NAACP, Michigan Chronicle, and City Market.

I. INTRODUCTION

 

In order to promote the revitalization of environmentally distressed and blighted areas
within the boundaries of the City of Detroit, Michigan (the ?City?), the City has
established the City of Detroit Brown?eld Redevelopment Authority (the 
pursuant to Michigan Public Act 381 of 1996, as amended (?Act 381?).

In 2010, a Brown?eld Plan entitled ?Brown?eld Plan for the 3800 Woodward Avenue
Redevelopment Project?, and dated October 1, 2010, (the ?Original Plan:?) was approved
by the DBRA and the City of Detroit City Council (approved by City Council on
November 30, 2010). In connection with the Original Plan, an Act 381 Work Plan (dated
July 8, 2014) and a Michigan Business Tax (MBT) Brown?eld Credit (the ?Credit?) were
also approved by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, predecessor to the
Michigan Strategic Fund The MBT Credit was amended on July 22, 2014 to
extend the date of completion by ?ve years to June 10, 2021.

The subject property was then the subject of an amended and restated Brown?eld Plan
dated March 12, 2014 and approved by the City of Detroit City Council on May 27, 2014
(the ?Modi?ed Plan?) which replaced the Original Plan. The Original Plan and Modi?ed
Plan were for a single parcel which has subsequently been split into the current 3800
Woodward and 3750 Woodward parcels.

The project included in the Modi?ed Plan failed to commence, and a portion of the
eligible property, subject to the Modi?ed Plan, was subsequently acquired by 3750
Woodward Avenue, LLC. 3750 Woodward Avenue, LLC desires to utilize the Credit,
upon approval by the MSF, and amend and restate the Modi?ed Plan to address, among
other things, the scope of the Project, the eligible activities, and the eligible investments
that were included in the aforementioned approvals.

The primary purpose of this Brown?eld Plan (the ?Plan?) is to amend, restate and
replace, in its entirety, the Modi?ed Plan. This Plan shall promote the redevelopment of
and private investment in certain ?brown?eld? properties within the City. Inclusion of
property within this Plan will facilitate ?nancing of environmental response and other
eligible activities at eligible properties, and will also provide tax incentives to eligible
taxpayers willing to invest in revitalization of eligible sites, commonly referred to as
?brown?elds.? By facilitating redevelopment of brown?eld properties, this Plan is
intended to promote economic growth for the bene?t of the residents of the City and all
taxing units located within and bene?ted by the DBRA.

This Plan is intended to apply to the eligible property identi?ed in this Plan and, if tax
increment revenues are proposed to be captured from that eligible property, to identify
and authorize the eligible activities to be funded by such tax increment revenues.

This Plan is intended to be a living document, which may be modi?ed or amended in
accordance with the requirements of Act 381, as necessary to achieve the purposes of Act
381. The identi?cation or designation of a developer or proposed use of the eligible
property shall not necessitate an amendment to this Plan, affect the application of this

Plan to the eligible property or impair the rights available to the DBRA under this Plan.
The applicable sections of Act 381 are noted throughout the Plan for reference purposes.

A. Description of the Eligible Pronertv (Section 13 (2mm and the Project

Proposed Redevelopment and Future Use For Each Eligible Property

The property comprising the eligible property consists of two parcels: 3750 Woodward
Avenue and 3800 Woodward Avenue. The parcels and all tangible personal property
located thereon will comprise the eligible property and is referred to herein as the
?Property.? The boundaries of the Property are shown in Figure 2.

3800 Woodward Avenue includes the completed rehabilitation of an existing l2-story

approximately 225 rooms. The residential component will include approximately 180
multi-family units (of which 36 will be affordable), 198 housing units targeted toward
students, and 60 condominiums. It is currently anticipated that construction will begin in
the summer of 2019 and eligible activities will be completed within two (2) years. 3750
Woodward Avenue, LLC is the project developer (?Developer?) for the Project and
owner of the Property at 3750 Woodward Avenue.

The project description provided herein is a summary of the proposed development at the
time of the adoption of the Plan. The actual development may vary from the project
description provided herein, without necessitating an amendment to this Plan, so long as
such variations are not material and arise as a result of changes in market and/or
?nancing conditions affecting the project and/or are related to the addition or immaterial
removal of amenities to the project. All material changes, as determined by DBRA in its
sole discretion, to the project description are subject to the approval of the DBRA staff

included auto repair and painting operations, a hospital, an electronics school, and a
funeral home. The original commercial buildings were demolished in 1964-65 for the
construction of a 12-story of?ce building and a 2?story mixed-use building, which were
constructed in 1965. The 12?story building was used as of?ce space for various tenants
including physicians, dentist, laboratories, attorneys, and the Detroit Carpenters Union.
The 2-story building was used as physician of?ces, a bank, and restaurants. The two-
story of?ce building was recently demolished to prepare the site for redevelopment, and
some foundations and utilities were installed for a previous site plan. The 12?story of?ce
tower was redeveloped from commercial to residential.

Second Amended and Restated Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

B. Basis of Eligibility (Section 13 and Section 2 

The Property is considered ?eligible property? as de?ned by Act 381, Section 2 because:
the Property was previously utilized for a commercial purpose; it is located within
the City of Detroit, a quali?ed local governmental unit under Act 381; the parcel at
3750 Woodward Avenue was determined to be a facility in accordance to Part 201 of Act
451, and the parcel at 3800 Woodward Avenue is adjacent and continuous and the
development of the adjacent or contiguous parcel is estimated to increase the captured
taxable value of the remainder of the eligible property.*.

*Prior to the tax split, the Original Plan quali?ed the Property as eligible property
because it was: previously utilized or is currently utilized for a commercial
purpose; located within the City of Detroit, a quali?ed local governmental unit
under Act 381; (0) determined to be functionally obsolete as de?ned by Act 381;
and also quali?ed as a facility in accordance to Part 201 of PA 451. The
buildings were de?ned as functionally obsolete because the con?gurations did not
meet current market demand for modern medical facilities or of?ce and retail
space. The mechanical and electrical systems were inef?cient and inadequate to
support current technologies used in commercial and medical of?ces. In addition,
the in?exible ?oor plate of the core was dominated by a central elevator which
prevents more ef?cient of?ce layouts that tenants demand.

Soil investigations were conducted in at least 1997 and 2010. The parcel at 3750
Woodward Avenue is a facility in accordance to Part 201 of PA 451 and the subject of
four Baseline Environmental Assessments (BEAs). The ?rst BEA for Professional Plaza,
LLC was af?rmed on April 18, 1997. The second BEA for Woodward Of?ces, LLC was
af?rmed on March 13, 2003. The third BEA for Midtown Project, LLC was submitted
on June 5, 2013. The most recent BEA will be submitted for disclosure for 3750
Woodward Avenue, LLC.

The most recent Phase I environmental site assessment (BSA) was completed for 3750
Woodward Ave, LLC on August 28, 2018. The Phase I revealed the following
recognized environmental conditions (RECs) on the Property:

?The Subject Property has been determined to be a facility under Part 201, based
on environmental investigations completed during 1996, 2003, and 2010. Facility
status is likely the result of historical occupants (ex. Auto services, hospital,
undertaker/funeral home) that utilized hazardous substances and petroleum
products.?

The most recent BEA was completed for 3750 Woodward Ave, LLC on September 24,
2018. The BEA determined the following:
?The Subject Property is a ?facility? as de?ned in Section 20126 of Part 201 based
on the presence of benzo(a)pyrene in soil at concentrations exceeding the
Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) GRCC for

C. Summary of'Eligible Activities and Description of Costs (Section 13 
The ?eligible activities? that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
?eligible activities? as de?ned by Section 2 of Act 381, because they include
environmental assessments, site demolition, public infrastructure, site preparation,
preparation of a Brown?eld Plan and 381 Work Plan, and associated professional and
project management costs as described herein. Some of these activities were completed
before approval of the Plan as part of the Modi?ed Plan or as necessary to conduct
environmental due diligence for this Plan.

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity
intended to be paid for with tax increment revenues from the Property are shown in the

Second Amended and Restated Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall
commence within eighteen (18) months after the date the governing body approves this
Plan and be completed within three (3) years after approval of the Michigan Strategic
Fund work plan, if applicable, or three (3) years after execution of the Reimbursement
Agreement (as that term is de?ned below). Any long-term monitoring or operation and
maintenance activities or obligations that may be required will be performed in
compliance with the terms of this Plan and any documents prepared pursuant to this Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities incurred by it
as described below. Some eligible activities may commence prior to the adoption of this
Plan and to the extent permitted by Act 381 shall be reimbursable pursuant to the
Reimbursement Agreement. Tax increment revenue generated by the Property will be
captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible activities completed
on the Property pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by
the DBRA and the Developer after approval of this Plan (the ?Reimbursement
Agreement?), to the extent permitted by Act 381. In the event this Plan contemplates the
capture of tax increment revenue derived from ?taxes levied for school operating
purposes? (as de?ned by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and hereinafter referred to as ?School
Taxes?), the Developer acknowledges and agrees that obligation to reimburse
the Developer for the cost of eligible activities with tax increment revenue derived from
Local Taxes, or Speci?c Taxes that are considered Local Taxes, (as these capitalized
terms are de?ned by Act 381) is contingent upon: the Developer receiving at least the
initial applicable work plan approvals by the Michigan Strategic Fund and the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality, as may be required pursuant to Act 381, within
180 days after the date this Plan is approved by the governing body, or such other date as
the DBRA may agree to in writing or (ii) the Developer providing the DBRA with
evidence, satisfactory to DBRA, that the Developer has the ?nancial means to complete
the project without the capture of, and subsequent reimbursement with, the contemplated
School Taxes.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending on the nature and extent of environmental contamination and other unknown
conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities
encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax increment
revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the
Reimbursement Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be quali?ed for
reimbursement except to the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Reimbursement Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and this
Plan will dictate the total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement,
provided that the total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement
under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in
Attachment D. As long as the total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible
activities may be adjusted after the date this Plan is approved by the governing body, to
the extent the adjustments do not violate the terms of the approved EGLE or MSF work
plan.

The Developer anticipates approval of property tax abatements for various portions of the
Project. The retail and student housing portions of the Project are anticipated to have an
Act 201 tax abatement for up to 10 years. The multi-family and remaining residential
portions (excluding any affordable housing component) of the Project are anticipated to
have an Act 147 (Neighborhood Enterprise Zone) tax abatement for new construction for
up to 15 years. The hotel portion of the Project is anticipated to have an Act 255 tax
abatement for up to 12 years. In the event the above referenced abatement are approved,
the tax abatements will reduce the property tax obligations of Property for the periods
applicable under the applicable abatement certi?cate, thereby reducing the amount of tax
increment revenues available under this Plan. These abatements are included in the tax
capture assumptions provided with this Plan.

In no event shall the duration of this Plan exceed thirty-?ve (35) years following the date
of the governing body?s resolution approving the Original Plan, nor shall the duration of
the tax capture exceed the lesser of the period authorized under subsection (3) and (5) of
Section 13 of Act 381 or 30 years. Further, in no event shall the beginning date of the
capture of tax increment revenues be later than ?ve (5) years after the date of the
governing body?s resolution approving this Plan.

E. Plan of Financing (Section Maximum Amount of Indebtedness
[Section 

The eligible activities are to be ?nanced solely by the Developer. The DBRA will
reimburse the Developer for the cost of approved eligible activities, but only from tax
increment revenues generated from the Property. No advances have been or shall be
made by the City or the DBRA for the costs of eligible activities under this Plan.

All reimbursements authorized under this Plan shall be governed by the Reimbursement

Agreement. The inclusion of eligible activities and estimates of costs to be reimbursed in

this Plan are intended to authorize the DBRA to fund such reimbursements and does not

obligate the DBRA or the City to fund any reimbursement or to enter into the

Reimbursement Agreement providing for the reimbursement of any costs for which tax
9

increment revenues may be captured under this Plan, or which are permitted to be
reimbursed under this Plan. The amount and source of any tax increment revenues that
will be used for purposes authorized by this Plan, and the terms and conditions for such
use and upon any reimbursement of the expenses permitted by this Plan, will be provided
solely under the Reimbursement Agreement contemplated by this Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan,
the DBRA shall not incur any note or bonded indebtedness to ?nance the purposes of this
Plan.

Reimbursements under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the cost of
Eligible Activities permitted under this Plan.

The Property is included in this Plan to enable ?quali?ed taxpayers? as de?ned by
Michigan Public Act 36 of 2007, as amended (the ?Michigan Business Tax Act?) to avail
themselves of eligibility for a credit against their Michigan business tax liability for
?eligible investments?, as de?ned by Section 437(31) of Michigan Business Tax Act,
incurred on the Property after the adoption of this Plan. Eligible investment is estimated
at $195,800,000. The project is expecting to receive the 20% credit with a cap of $9
million for eligible investments.

By approval of this Plan, the DBRA and the City neither intend to make nor have made

Second Amended and Restated Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

Captured Taxable Value and Tax Increment Revenues Estimates

The initial taxable value will be the taxable value of the Property at the time the Original
Plan was approved, as shown by the 2010 assessment role at $1,650,000. For illustration
purposes only, this Plan uses a projected future taxable value of $46,085,000, not
including any affordable units, which is the estimated future taxable value of the Property
at the time of the next assessment roll after project completion. The captured taxable
value will be the difference between the initial taxable value and the actual taxable value
for each year for which this Plan is in effect.

A table of the total estimated tax increment revenues to be captured for the entire project
is attached to this Plan. Tax capture required for reimbursement of Eligible Activities as
described in this Plan is estimated at 25 years from 2020 using both Local Taxes and
School Taxes. Conservative assumptions were included in the captured taxable value and
tax rates. These assumptions are used for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended
to limit reimbursement of the actual annual tax capture amount. In the event that the
actual incremental tax capture is greater than the amount illustrated in the attached tables,
the Project will be eligible for reimbursement of the Eligible Activities described in this
Plan up to the actual incremental tax capture after contributions to the DBRA
administrative, and will not be limited to the amount illustrated for reimbursement in this
Plan. The following assumptions were used to develop the attached tables.

1. The capture of both Local Taxes and School Taxes are included in calculating
recapture.

2. Annual appreciation in taxable value is assumed at 

3. This Plan assumes a Act 210 tax abatement for the hotel, retail and student
housing components of the Project for the ?rst 10 years of capture and a
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) tax abatement for new construction for
the remaining residential components (not including any affordable housing
components) of the Project for the first 15 years of capture. These are
illustrated on the attached Brownfield TIF Capture table as Tax Capture Period 1
and Tax Capture Period 2, respectively.

RE: 3750 Woodward Avenue LLC Brownfield Redevelopment Plan

Dear Mr. Vosburg,

On behalf of the Midtown Detroit, Inc. (MDI), I would like to express our support for the redevelopment
of 3750 Woodward Avenue. MDI recognizes that this project is eligible for brownfield redevelopment
tax credits. These credits will provide a valuable financial benefit to support the completion of the
project, which will be a much-needed benefit to the surrounding neighborhood.

The development site is in a great, centralized location within the Midtown District. This proposed $175
million mixed-use project aims to further develop Midtown by bringing a 225-room boutique hotel; 60
luxury condos,- 200 apartment units; 500 beds of student housing; 100,000 square feet of retail; and a
750-space parking deck.

New for-sale, rental housing, and student housing options will support the growing residential demand
of a neighborhood facing 98% occupancy. The hotel and retail components will create new economic
opportunities for all. The various elements of this project will contribute to the revitalization taking

place in the area.

3750 Woodward is currently an underutilized property with the potential to become a thriving part of
the neighborhood. MDI is encouraged by the proposed development of 3750 Woodward Avenue and
believe it will have a meaningful impact on the surrounding neighborhood. MDI offers its full support of
this project. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 313.420.6000.

Sincerely,

7_

RE: Petition for the Establishment of a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone District at 3750
Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan.

Honorable City Council:

On behalf of 3750 Woodward Avenue, LLC, please accept this letter as a request to establish a
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone for the mixed-use development proiect knows as ?The Mid"
(3750 Woodward Avenue) in Midtown Detroit, located between Woodward and John and shown
more precisely on the map in Attachment A.

The Mid will be a 3.8-acre mixed-use development carefully planned to offer diverse programs;
including retail, hotel, housing, and dining experiences with interwoven public spaces for community,
resident, and visitor engagement and connectivity. The Mid?s planned investment exceeds $350
million, and will create over 1,800 construction iobs and 400+ full-time equivalent positions (FTEs).
The proiect is expected to commence construction in the 3rd quarter of 201 9 and be fully completed
by 2024.

This development aims to unite the surrounding community and residents across a range of
backgrounds and lifestyles. The Mid plans to incorporate hundreds of multi-family residences,
affordable housing, co-living housing units, and 60 residential condominiums to accommodate
Detroit?s rapidly growing demand for diverse housing and living types in a meaningful way. These
two melded residential towers will offer alternatives for family and communal living supported by
eateries, entertainment and public amenities.

The Mid requires significant investment and development risk and would not be possible without
incentives, including the property tax exemption certificates provided for under the establishment of
a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone.

We are requesting that the NEZ be applicable for the residential components of the development
proiect (both ?for rent" and ?for sale" components) for a period of fifteen (15) years. The
development area is eligible for NEZ designation pursuant to Section 3(1) of Public Act 147 of
1997, the Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Act (the The district, which is located in a
"Qualified downtown revitalization district" within the meaning of MCL will include at
least one new facility. The requested district is both compact and contiguous as understood
under the Act.

STEWARDS OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENTTM

7-May-i 9

The NEZ will lead to construction of new residential housing in keeping with the city of Detroit
Master Plan and the Woodward Avenue Gateway Radial Thoroughfare Overlay.

We respectfully request your consideration of a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone for the proiect.
Please do not hesitate to call me at 31 3-408-5384 with any questions.

RE: Request for the Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District at 1401 Vermont Street, Detroit, MI

Honorable City Council:

Please accept this letter as a request to establish an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
Development District for the property located at 1401 Vermont Street and described on

Attachment A.

This request is made on behalf of 4405P, LLC, a Nassif Holdings Company, which
acquired the property on February 15, 2019. As will be shown in this application, it is the
intent of this development to honor the building?s unique and colorful history, while
creating a modern and safe work environment that will allow neighborhood and city
residents the opportunity to expand their professional skills, increase home ownership,
and blend in with the art-filled building facades found in Corktown.

We will renovate the existing structure and site, while working diligently to repair and
maintain the exterior and interior art installations. We are retaining Detroit based
professional ?rms for the renovation and on-going management of the facility. We are
targeting tenants that have a positive impact on their communities; ones that create
opportunities for City and neighborhood residents to expand their professional skill sets
and increase home ownership opportunities.

We have demonstrated the ability to execute on this commitment through our recent
redevelopment of 42 Watson Street, which is now fully occupied and has generated many
jobs, two new businesses, one business relocation from Livonia, and one from Royal

Oak.

This request corresponds to MCL 125.2783 Sec. 3. (1) A quali?ed local governmental
unit, by resolution of its legislative body, may establish 1 or more obsolete property
rehabilitation districts that may consist of 1 or more parcels or tracts of land or a portion
of a parcel or tract of land, if at the time the resolution is adopted, the parcel or tract of
land or portion of a parcel or tract of land within the district is either of the following: 
Obsolete property in an area characterized by obsolete commercial property or
commercial housing property.

We appreciate City Council?s review of this application as the redevelopment is not
possible without the 12-year abatement.

The capital investment in this project, including acquisition, exceeds $4,500,000. Tenant
improvement allowances could require an additional $500,000. The capital stack for this
is comprised of owner?s equity, a ?rst mortgage from CinnairefDevelop Michigan, and a
second mortgage from Invest Detroit. The debt service For this project is high, as a 13%
return minimum is required by the lenders. Without the tax abatement we not be able to
obtain rent levels to make this feasible.

The development team is creating extensive Detroit?based job growth through this
venture. For example, the real estate brokerage ?rm listing the asset (De?ne Real Estate)
is a new company based in Detroit (and owned by a Detroit resident). The listing of this
building has allowed the owner to hire a junior broker and lease of?ce space in Brush
Park. The property manager (Beanstalk) will have stall" dedicated to this asset increasing
their full-time employment. Likewise, other Detroit-based firms are active in the

redevelopment.

Given the nature and amount of capital investment over the next ?ve years at the subject,
we request a twelve-year abatement.

As stated above, it is the intent of this development to have a sustained impact on not
only the Corktown neighborhood, but the City of Detroit in its entirety. We are targeting
tenants that will ?give-back? to the city, either through new job growth or through
training Detroiters to fill the fast-growing (and underserved) technology industry. it is our
hope that the people who come through this building will ?ll other new jobs in Detroit,
and that the capital improvements required to bring the building up to standard will
enable a number of new Detroit companies to grow and expand.

The ?nancial discipline of the development team, including maintaining the current
property taxes being paid in full, will enable this growth.

Thank you again for your time and consideration. This exciting development will enable
a generation of Detroiters to seek their own futures and expand into newr career paths. We
will add a splash of art and color to a very concrete colored street. With the assistance of
City Council, we will be able to build a ?nancially feasible development.

Exhibit Property Description: The building was built in two phases, with the ?rst
occurring in the early 1930?s as a print shop. Later, sometime between 1955-195 8
an addition was added to the building on the northern side. The building was
owned and operated from its original construction until 2011 with the current
seller (Ponyride) acquired it. Since 2011 the seller has subleased portions of the
building to a variety of tenants. Over the last eight years Ponyride has tied the
building to local and national artists through the commissioning of interior and
exterior murals. It is our hope and desire to maintain the existing artwork. In 2018
the seller decided to vacate and sell the building (please see attached letter
verifying the sale was voluntary and best for the ?nances of Ponyride).

Proposed Use: Upon completion of the proposed renovation the subject will be
used mainly as of?ce and showroom space. We have been approached by a
number of restaurants to occupy the building. We are targeting business that will
provide a positive bene?t to the community. In one case we are working with a
?rm that does adult bootcamp style coding training to help adults enter tech
positions. In another case we are discussing options for two ?rms currently
located in the suburbs to move to Detroit and help ?rst-time home owners.

Proposed Renovation: The renovation will include a full demolition of the
interior, recon?guring and new construction of all interior partitions, renovation
or replacement of the existing elevator, painting and repairing the murals on the
exterior of the building, a partial roof replacement (over the 1950?s portion of the
building), new windows on the ground floor, and exterior work including

repairing the parking lot.

Building Equipment Detail: Very little to none of the existing personal property
will remain in place at the subject. We are planning on retaining some compressed
air lines at the property for future use, but little to no other personal property will

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Of?ce of the Chief Financial Of?cer, Of?ce of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District located at 1401 Vermont, 1435 Vermont, 1443 Vermont and 1442 Wabash near the West Side Industrial area.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the

anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or signi?cant rehabilitation of existing

commercial property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
marketxalue. . .. - -.

4405P LLC plans to rehabilitate the building for use as mainly of?ce and showroom space. The two-story building at 1401
Vermont is currently vacant, has 28,363 square foot of?ce building area, built 1923 with additional building area added in
1955, and situated on .489 acres of land. The other addresses consists of parking lots on a total of .275 acres of land.
Rehabilitation will include a full demolition of the interior, recon?guring and new construction ofall interior partitions,
renovation or replacement of the existing elevator, partial roof replacement, new windows on the ground floor and
exterior work including repairing the parking lot.

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore Or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically ef?cient condition. Rehabilitation also includes
major renovation and modi?cation including, but not necessarily limited to, the improvement of floor loads, correction of
de?cient or excessive height, new or improved ?xed building equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reducing multistory facilities to 1 or 2 stories, adding additional stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same
floor level not to exceed 100% of the existing floor space on that floor level, improved structural support including
foundations, improved roof structure and cover, floor replacement, improved wall placement, improved exterior and
interior appearance of buildings, and other physical changes required to restore or change the obsolete property to an
economically efficient condition.

A ?eld investigation indicated that the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District located at 1401 Vermont, 1435
Vermont, 1443 Vermont and 1442 Wabash is eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act under P.A.
146 of 2000, as amended.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District (PA 146) at 1401, 1435, 1443
Vermont Street and 1442 Wabash
DATE: May 6, 2019
CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

In order to ensure that the creation of an Obsolete Property District is in conformance with the City?s
Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity; create,
retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents in a
community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 146 of 2000 (section 125.2788), the Planning and
Development Department submits the following interpretation. The Petitioner of this project is Nassif
Holdings LLC.

Location and Project Proposal: 1401 1435, 1442 Vermont Street and 1442 Wabash; Project seeks to
renovate existing structure and site that honors the structure?s unique history while also creating a
modern and safe work environment that targets professionals that wish to support professional
skills/development, home ownership resources, or services that support community and resident good.
Project will provide office and showroom space. Project will also repair and maintain exterior and
interior art installations.

Existing Site Information: The building was built in two phases, with the first occurring in the early
19305 as a print shop. Later, between 1955-1958 an addition was added to the building on the northern
side. The building was owned and operated from its original construction until 2011 with the current
seller (Ponyride) acquired it. Since 2011, the seller has subleased portions of the building to a variety of
tenants. Over the last eight years Ponyride has tied the building to local and national artists through the
commissioning of interior and exterior murals. In 2018, the seller (Ponyride) decided to vacate and sell
the building.

Interpretation

impact on Sarroandina Land Use

According to the Master Plan Future Land Use Map, the project site is bounded by areas designated as
Light Industrial (IL). The zoning of the project site is M4 (Intensive Industrial District), to the north and
the east of the project site is also classified as to the west of the subject site the block is zoned M3
(General Industrial District) and M2 (Restricted Industrial District). The project site is surrounded by
large "big box? operations and fenced perimeters. The proposed project would help the area?s public
aesthetic by injecting a set of neighborhood-friendly operations than what currently exists in the area
impact an Transportation

The project site has access to one bus line and a MoGo bike-share station on Bagley Street to the north
and access to one bus line along Rosa Parks Blvd. The project site's proposal could attract ridership to
these existing lines. Contingent on the number of employees and emerging volume of
retail/restaurant/hospitality destination interests in the area of Corktown bounded by the rail line,
Bagley, Sixth Street, and Fort, DDOT may consider adding a stop on Rosa Parks at Porter Street to
further support access to surrounding businesses.

 

 

Master Plan Interpretation

The subject site area is designated Light Industrial (IL). Light Industrial areas should generally consist of
industrial uses of low intensity that have minimum undesirable effects on adjacent residential or
commercial land uses. Small-scale industrial uses may include machine shops, small scale assembly or

packaging, warehousing or technology parks.

While the proposed project is not industrial by nature, the proposed uses on the .77 acre site will not
negatively impact nor drastically change the character of the current surroundings. As neighborhood
destinations continue to emerge in the area, a Master Plan Amendment may be explored in the future
to better align with anticipated future land uses and future planning recommendations. In the interim,
further discussion regarding the future land uses of this area will be explored during the City?s upcoming
Corktown Neighborhood Planning Process.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the
area.
