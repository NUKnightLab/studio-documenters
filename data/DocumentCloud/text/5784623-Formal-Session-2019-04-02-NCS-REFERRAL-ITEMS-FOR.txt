Dear Ms. Anderson,

On behalf of the Chandler Park Conservancy, I am writing to offer our full assistance in
designing and installing the Marshland at the southeast corner in Chandler Park. The costs,
approximately $1.1 Million, will be funded through grants and donations made to the Chandler
Park Conservancy. These improvements will take place Spring 2019 through Spring 2020. We
have worked with community representatives to ensure these improvements are desired and are in
accordance of the Chandler Park Master Plan.

The installing contractor will maintain the marshland and all mechanical features for the ?rst 3
seasons (2020, 21, 22) and we ask that GSD take over at the 4th season to remove invasive
species and trash, clean out debris from the pump vault, remove accumulated sediments in the
marsh conveyance basin to maintain this site throughout the year.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

 

Alex J. Allen, 111, President CEO
