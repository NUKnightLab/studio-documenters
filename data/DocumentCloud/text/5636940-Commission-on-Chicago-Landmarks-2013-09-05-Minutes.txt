historic building and plaza, both of which are significant features of the
landmark designation.

Proposal:

Proposed revisions to previously reviewed 1-story rooftop addition and

and,
3. A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing how the historic
facades to remain should be supported, braced and protected, in-situ,
during the demolition of the exterior portions of the building and the
interior structure and the excavation and construction of the new
addition as well as during the foundation work, shall be included on
the permit plans. The recommended measures, sequencing, and

drawings.

7.

approximate the window heights of nearby historic buildings.
Dimensions of the adjacent historic windows shall be included with
the permit plans for comparison. All window details shall be
submitted for review and approval with the permit plans.

9.

2064 N. Humboldt
(Logan Square Boulevards District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of a 3-story masonry residential building and rear
detached garage including removal of existing curb-cut, driveway and
non-historic garage.

Action:

Approved 4-1 (with Commissioner Smith voting against) with the
following conditions:
1. The north side façade, which is visible due to the lower adjacent
building, shall be clad with utility-sized brick to match the color and
texture of common brick. The stair enclosure at the north side of the
roof, proposed to be clad in stucco, shall be in a stucco color to match
the utility-sized brick;
2. Window and door details shall be included with the permit plans; and,
3. The project requires a zoning variation and/or administrative
adjustment review for the proposed side yard setbacks. The
Committee supports the 1’-3”-wide side yards as proposed so that the
width of the new house can be consistent with the scale of the historic
houses in the district.

10.

(Wicker Park District – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of a 2-story masonry single-family residence and

residence shall be submitted with the permit application for Historic
Preservation staff review and approval.

11.

4058 S. Lake Park
(Oakland Multiple Resources District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: Proposed door replacement, window alterations, and trim
installation to address work done contrary to approved permit.

Action:

The Committee found that the project as proposed does not meet the
criteria set forth in the Commission’s Rules and Regulations, the
Commission’s Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings and New
Construction, and Standard 6 of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings and therefore, the
project would have an adverse effect on the significant historical and
architectural features of the landmark property and district.
The Committee advised the applicant to submit a permit application to
remove the non-conforming windows, and meet the permit approval by
installing new windows and trim to match the historic design, operation,
and profiles. Should Historic Preservation staff receive a permit
application for the project as currently proposed, staff shall issue a
preliminary disapproval of the application. A preliminary disapproval of
the application would trigger an informal conference and, if the informal
conference does not reach an accord, a public hearing on the permit
application would be scheduled in accordance with the provisions of the
Chicago Landmarks Ordinance.
