APPROVE RENEWAL OF ISBE WAIVERS

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Chicago Board of Education (the ?Board?) approve the renewal applications for three waivers of Illinois
State Board of Education rules and state mandates. The three Waivers are: (1) to allow CPS to distribute
supplemental general state aid (SGSA) based on its formula for student attendance; (2) to allow CPS more

4 ?exibility in procuring food services; and (3) to allow CPS more ?exibility in scheduling school improvement days.
Upon approval of this Board Report, the renewal waiver applications described below will be fomrarded to the


PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICES: A Public Hearing on the renewal waiver applications will be held on
November 18, 2015, in accordance with Section 2-3.25g of the illinois School Code. Notice was posted on the
CPS and Board websites and published in a 'Chicago newspaper and provided to illinois state legislators who
represent Chicago and collective bargaining agents as required by Section 2-3.25g of the illinois School Code.

OF THE RENEWAL WAIVERS:
1. Supplemental General State Aid Waiver

Section 203.20a of the 23 Illinois Administrative Code requires the school district to use the total number of
students receiving free and reduced meals from December 1 of the year preceding the school year as the date to
determine the school allocation of SGSA funds. CPS past practice has been to use the schools 20th day of
instruction?s free and reduced meals count of previous'year to determine initial allocation of SGSA funds for
current year. A ?nal SGSA allocation is based on the number of Eligible students as of 20th day of the current
school year. The district holds a waiver that allows CEO or designee to continue the' practice of using the 20"1 day
model until the end of this school year. In order to continue this practice, the district needsto renew this waiver
for two years. 

2. Food Service Procurement
Section 34-213 of the illinois School Code onlyallows for food services to be procm'ed asa request for bid
(RFB). The USDA federal regulations allow school districts to procure the expertise of a management or vended 

meal company using a request for bid (RFB) or request for proposal (RFP) process. The renewal of this waiver
for ?ve years will allow CPS to continue to cheese either an RFB or RFP to procure food services. - .

16

November 18, 2015

3. School Improvement Waiver

The school improvement waiver will allow the CEO or designee to schedule school improvement plan activities for
teachers in full day sessions rather than half day sessions. Section of the Illinois School Code
relates to the calculation of student attendance days and the requirements for accumulating extra student
attendance hours during a speci?ed period of time to schedule half day sessions. The waiver would replace a
half day session with a full day session and may be counted as a day of student attendance up to four times a
school year as long as the req'uired ?ve clock hours of student instruction time is provided to students throughout
the school term. The renewal waiver application shall request a ?ve year waiver period, beginning during the
2017 school year and ending after the 2021 school year.

AUTHORIZATION: Authorize the Chief Executive Of?cer or designee to execute the renewal of the waiver
applications described above and submit it to in accordance with Section 2-325g of the School Code.

Attn: Susan Marek

DESCRIPTION: in 2008, the Board of Education of the City of Chicago (the ?Board?) and the City of
Chicago (?the City?) embarked on a joint program to rehabilitate public schools to increase 
within the meaning of the Americans With Disabilities Act (the and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act (?Section 504?) and in accordance with Board Policies 501.1 and 501.3 (the "Program",
as authorized by Board Report 08-0423-R821). The Board committed to spend $20 million per year for 5
years for a total of $100 million and the City committed to spend $14,250,250 the first year and $5 million
per year for the next 4 years for a total of $34,250,250. CPS has met its $100 million commitment. This
Board authority addresses reimbursement for the City?s commitments for all future agreements related to
the Program.

On April 9, 2008, the City Council of the City (the "'City Council") approved an Ordinance (the "2008
Ordinance'), a copy of which ordinance is on ?le with the Secretary of the Board, in which the City
Council, among other matters, directed the City to use a portion of tax increment ?nancing monies
to fund 15 school rehabilitations. Pursuant to the 2008 Ordinance, the City and the Board entered into an
Intergovernmental Agreement dated October 28, 2009 (the ?2009 Intergovernmental Agreement"),
specifying certain schools to be rehabilitated for improved accessibitity, including certain rehabilitation
projects that would receive a speci?ed portion of tax increment ?nancing and certain schools to be
rehabilitated using Board funds or a combination of both sources of funds.

To continue the Program, on April 13, 2011, the City Council approved an Ordinance (the "2011
Ordinance"), a copy of which Ordinance is on ?le with the Secretary of the Board. Pursuant to the 2011
Ordinance, certain additional schools were identi?ed to be rehabilitated for improved accessibility and
which will receive a speci?ed portion of tax increment ?nancing; and certain additional schools which
were rehabilitated using Board funds or a combination of both sources of funds.

Prior to the execution of the intergovernmental agreement authorized by the 2011 Ordinance,
programmatic changes to schools, school closures, and changes in projections of tax increment ?nancing
revenues resulted in changes to the approved list of projects to be funded by the City. The 2008
Intergovernmental Agreement does not address these changes. The Board is requesting reimbursement
from the City of up to the maximum allowed for completed projects through the execution and delivery of
additional intergovernmental agreements.

district. The term of each intergovernmental agreement shall be a maximum. of twenty-six (26) years from
the date of execution of the agreement by both parties.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARTIES: The City has stated in the 2008 Ordinance and in the 2011
Ordinance its intent to use a portion of available increment under 65 to pay
quali?ed redevelopment project costs (the "City Funds"), to pay .to or reimburse the Board for the quali?ed
costs of such projects, to the extent that such costs constitute TlF-Funded Improvements as defined in
the applicable intergovernmental agreement. The Board agrees that it has completed or shall complete
the Projects and provide a list of total project costs and qualified reimbursable costs to the City.

CONTRIBUTION: No additional Board funds are needed to complete projects identi?ed in the 2008
Ordinance or the 2011 Ordinance.
