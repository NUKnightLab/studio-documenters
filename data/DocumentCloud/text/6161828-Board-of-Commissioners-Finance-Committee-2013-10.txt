 Justice Advisory Council – FY2013 Accomplishments
FY2014 Budget Presentation

Fiscal Responsibility: In 2013, the JAC worked to broaden the pool of applicants for the
Recidivism Reduction grants and utilized a rigorous RFP process to award violence reduction
grant dollars in conjunction with the newly established Violence Prevention, Intervention &
Reduction Advisory Committee.
Innovative Leadership: In 2013, JAC hosted its third “Barriers to Reentry” forum and continued
to provide demographic information and data to help support communities in obtaining funding for
needed services.

Transparency & Accountability: In 2013, JAC began to examine the issue of the increasing
length of stay at the Cook County Jail. This included hosting a forum, co-sponsored by the
American Bar Association and Loyola University, on Court Efficiencies. Commissioned a study by
Prof. Don Stemen of Loyola University and convened stakeholders to discuss felony case
processing in the Circuit Court of Cook County.
Improved Services: In 2013, the JAC continued efforts to reduce reliance on pretrial detention at
the Cook County Jail and Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, including capital
improvements to the interview space at Bond Court. Working with juvenile justice stakeholders
and advocate in preparation for “Raise the Age” implementation.

• Lead an intergovernmental effort to provide law enforcement led street level diversion for
women arrested for prostitution, which will reduces court involvement for a vulnerable,
victimized population and streamlines service delivery
• Conduct seminars for grant applicants to increase fiscal capacity and accountability, and better
target resources for recidivism reduction, strengthening our community partnerships
• Lead a foundation funded effort to reduce pretrial detention by providing judges with better
information, acquired and assembled by a new, cross professional team, which will reduce
detention for Cook County residents and improve indigent defense
• Funding, directing and sharing high quality research findings, by qualified academics,
illuminating case processing in Cook County and the sources of court delay, which is vital to
laying the foundation for data driven collaboration among criminal justice stakeholders
