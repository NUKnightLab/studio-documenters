HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Request of Mona Ross-Gardner to amend Article XVII, District Map 4, of the
1984 Detroit City Code, Chapter 61, Zoning, to modify the provisions of the
existing PD-H (Planned Development District-Historic) zoning classi?cation
established by Ordinance 25-96 at the property commonly known as 2458 Brush
Street and also 419 and 429 E. Fisher Fwy to allow for a standard restaurant as
defined in Sec. 61-16-41 of the Detroit Zoning Ordinance, including the sale and
consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises (RECOMMEND
APPROVAL CONDITIONS).

DATE: October 8, 2018

NATURE OF REQUEST
Before this Honorable Body is the request of Mona Ross-Gardner to modify the provisions of an

existing PD (Planned Development District-Historic) zoning classi?cation established by
Ordinance 25 -96 at the property commonly known as 2458 Brush Street and also 419 and 429 E.
Fisher Fwy. to allow for a standard restaurant as de?ned in Sec. 61-16-41 of the Detroit Zoning
Ordinance, including the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises. A public
on this request is set for your next meeting on August 6, 2018.

BACKGROUND AND PROPOSAL
The subject property exists as a community center owned and operated by Mrs. Ross-Gardner in

the Brush Park Historic District. Previously, the building?s permitted use was that of a dry
cleaners facility.

Currently, the petitioner proposes to develop the property at 2458 Brush Street, 419 and 429 E.
Fisher Fwy,. as a standard restaurant (without drive-through) to allow for the sale and
consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises. Two of the lots in this proposal function as
a parking lot that lies to the east of the existing facility.

The proposed use is subject to a PD modi?cation because it is currently not allowed on the
subject parcel under the Brush Park Third Modi?ed development plan which are the provisions
that currently govern the site. The modi?cation to allow for this use, would amend the current
PD to allow for the requested land use on the subject properties.

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS
Surrounding Zoning and Land Use
The zoning classi?cation and land uses surrounding the subject area are as follows:

North: Unoccupied parcels
East: Unoccupied parcels
South: Fisher Fwy?gp
West: Unoccupied parcels

Master Plan Consistency

The subject site is located within the Lower Woodward area of Neighborhood Cluster 4 of the
Detroit Master Plan of Policies (MP). The Future Land Use map for this area shows High
Density Residential for the subject property. CPC staff considers this proposal to conform with
the MP.

COMMUNITY INPUT AND PUBLIC HEARING RESULTS

The petitioner has submitted a letter of support from the Brush Park CDC in regard to the
proposed restaurant use. The CDC unanimously voted to support the proposed use and the letter
indicates that community members have made favorable comments in regard to the project.

No members of the public spoke at the August public hearing.

Proposed orm Based Zoning Consistency

Staff has evaluated the proposed use and ?nds that it is consistent with the intent of the draft of
the forthcoming Form Based Code proposal that has been circulated amongst the community and
City epresentatives. The plan gives provision for ?standard restaurants? and ?brewpubs,
establishments for the sale of beer or intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises, and
SDM uses on the ground ?oor? given that they front a north/south street or streets? as the
regulating plan of the FBC draft calls out. In which case, the subject Brush Street would qualify
as a location for the standard restaurant use and allow for the sale of beer or intoxicating liquor
for consumption on the premises.

APPROVAL CRITERIA

According to the approval criteria outlined in Sec. 61-3 -96 of the Zoning Ordinance, staff points
to criterion (4) which asks, ?whether the location of the proposed planned development district
is appropriate. 

Staff believes that the proposed use is appropriate because of its location and frontage being on
the north/south thoroughfare of Brush Street, which is one of the locations that the City and
community envisioned for such uses to be placed according to the proposed Form Based Code
and other past planning efforts.

Criterion 7) states that, ?the proposed type and density of use shall not result in an
unreasonable increase in tra??ic or the use of public services, facilities and utilities, that the
natural features of the subject site have the capacity to accommodate the intended development,
and that the development shall not place an unreasonable burden upon surrounding land or land
owners. 

The location of the facility as exists today will be conducive to the amount of traf?c that will be
drawn to this use. The property lies on the north/south thoroughfare of Brush Street, which has a
higher capacity for traf?c than the surrounding residential streets. It is also bounded by the
Fisher Fly Service Drive, which eliminates possible nuisances to the residential community
because there are no residences in the immediate vicinity. The ingress to the proposed restaurant
use would also be located on the service drive, limiting deleterious impacts to any adjacent
property owners. The proposed use is also intended to cater to the residents of the community.

Criterion (8) asks ?whether the proposed Planned Development is consistent with the Master
Plan, as determined by the Planning and Development Department?

CPC considers the subject request to be consistent with the Master Plan designation for the
subject area.

RECOMMENDATION

CPC staff recommends approval of Mona Ross-Gardner?s request to modify the provisions of the
existing (Planned Development District-Historic) zoning classi?cation established by
Ordinance 25-96 at the property commonly known as 2458 Brush Street and also 419 and 429 E.
Fisher Fwy. to allow for a standard restaurant as de?ned in Sec. 61-16-162 of the Detroit Zoning
Ordinance, including the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises with the
following conditions:

. No drive-up or drive-through facilities are allowed.

. The developer must work with the immediately adjacent community to minimize disruption to
the neighborhood during construction and address impacts that may arise;

. Final site plans, elevations, lighting, landscape and signage plans be submitted by the developer
to the staff of the City Planning Commission for review and approval prior to making application
for any necessary permits.

Petition for Section 711 Property Tax Exemption

Detroit, MI 48226

Re: Rock Economic Development Group Petition for Property Tax Exemption
Pursuant to MCL 211.7tt

Honorable City Council:

In connection with the development of the new Wayne County Criminal Justice Center,
Rock Economic Development Group hereby requests that this Honorable Body adopt
a resolution pursuant to Section 7tt of the General Property Tax Act (MCL 211.7tt) to exempt the
property described on Exhibit A (collectively, the ?Property?) from the collection of property
taxes. The Property consists of Wayne County?s ?failed jail? site, the Frank Murphy Hall of
Justice, the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center, and the Wayne County Division 1 and
Division 2 Jails. The Property has long been exempt from property taxation.

Background

REDG is a non-pro?t, unincorporated association whose primary purpose is assembling or
combining parcels of real property for economic development purposes.

As has been widely reported, the Property is being conveyed to REDG as consideration
for the agreement of other Rock entities to construct the new Wayne County Criminal Justice
Center for Wayne County (the ?County?), and to bear the cost in excess of the available County
funds. Because the Property serves as the consideration, conveyance of the Property at this time
(long before the Property will be available for redevelopment) is necessary to make the
construction of the new Wayne County Criminal Justice Center possible.

With the exception of the failed jail site, the County will continue to operate the Property
until the completion of the new Wayne County Criminal Justice Center. Speci?cally, REDG has
leased back the currently operational criminal justice facilities (the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice,
the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center, and the Wayne County Division 1 and Division 2
Jails) to the County for $1.00, and these properties will continue to operate as public criminal
justice facilities. (See Lease of Operational Criminal Justice Facilities, attached hereto as Exhibit
B). For all practical purposes, they remain County facilities.

Due to Wayne County?s previous issuance of tax-exempt bonds for the jail construction,

the failed jail site had to be separately conveyed to REDG to comply with IRS requirements. It
will not be subject to the $1.00 lease, as it is not an operational facility. However, the failed jail

CLERK 4 2018 

 

Rock Economic Development Group
Petition for Section 7tt Property Tax Exemption

site will be held by REDG on a non?pro?t basis and will not be redeveloped until the entirety of
the Property is vacated by the County and available for comprehensive redevelopment.1

Recognizing that the conveyance of the Property is necessary to enable delivery of the
new Criminal Justice Center, (2) because of this necessity, the conveyance is occurring well in
advance of the ability to redevelop the Property, and (3) the Property will remain substantially
occupied by the County, the Wayne County Criminal Justice Center deal contemplated that the
Property would remain exempt from taxation pursuant to Section 7tt of the General Property Tax
Act for the ?holding period? during which REDG is holding the Property on a non-pro?t basis for
future redevelopment. (See Section 8.12 of the Development and Purchase and Sale Agreement,
attached hereto as Exhibit D). REDG now seeks this Honorable Body?s consideration and
approval of this exemption.

Exemption for Property Held by a Non-Profit Economic Development Group

Section 7tt of the General Property Tax Act, MCL 211.7tt, permits the City Council to
adopt a resolution exempting, for up to seven years, real property that is owned by an ?eligible
economic development group?. MCL 211.7tt(8) de?nes an ?eligible economic development
group? as ?a nonpro?t organization, the primary purpose of which is the economic development
of real property or combining parcels of real property for economic deve10pment purposes.?

REDG quali?es as an economic development group under the statute because it is a non?
pro?t, unincorporated association forrned under Delaware law whose primary purpose is the
economic development of real property or combining parcels of real property for economic
development purposes. (See Agreement of Members of Rock Economic Development Group,
attached hereto as Exhibit E.)

The exemption is requested for the seven year allowable period or until such time as the
development of the Property is commenced, whichever is earlier. Accordingly, the exemption
would be effective December 31, 2018 and would remain in effect until December 30, 2025 or
until such time as development of the Property commences, if earlier. If development of any
portion of the Property commences prior to December 31, 2025, the exemption for that portion
would terminate.

It is important to emphasize that the exemption is only for the period of time the Property
is held by REDG pending future development (the ?holding period?) and will end when
development commences. Any tax abatement or other incentives for ?iture development would
have to be sought in connection with the future redevelopment.

 

1 REDG and a Rock af?liate (1208 Woodward LLC) have entered into an agreement whereby the Rock
af?liate has the right to use the failed jail site for construction parking for other projects in downtown Detroit in
exchange for funding the demolition of the partially completed jail. This arrangement provides the means for the
failed jail site to be cleared for future redevelopment, in furtherance of non-pro?t economic development
purpose. (See Demolition Agreement Gratiot Jail Site, attached hereto as Exhibit C.)

Rock Economic Development Group
Petition for Section 7tt Property Tax Exemption

As a ?nal matter, it should be noted that Section 7tt(6) allows the county in which the
exemption is being granted to withdraw its millages from the exemption, such that those mills
would continue to be levied. Wayne County has agreed that it will not withdraw its millages if the
exemption is approved, and that property taxes levied by Wayne County be subject to the
exemption. (See Section 8.12 of the Development and Purchase and Sale Agreement, attached

hereto as Exhibit D).

The requested exemption is an integral part of proj ects that will have a substantial positive
impact on economic development in the City. The construction of a new Wayne County Criminal
Justice Center is a major public works project that will generate signi?cant economic impact while
consolidating and modernizing criminal justice operations, meeting critical capacity needs, and
improving conditions. Moreover, once that project is completed, the Property will be available for
productive redevelopment.

REDG appreciates the City Council?s consideration of this important matter.

Sincerely,

Rock 15ch ?n Group

RE: Eligible Economic Development Group Property Tax Exemption (MCL 211. 7tt) Rock Economic Development Group
Property Address: 570 Clinton, 525 Clinton, 1326 St. Antoine, 1441 St. Antoine, 1400 St. Antoine
Parcel Number: 03000240-1, 03000279?88, 03000239., 03000278., 03000244-77

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the request by Rock Economic Development Group, a
non-project, unincorporated association whose primary purpose is assembling and combing parcels of real property for economic
development purposes, for the proposed Eligible Economic Development Group Property Tax Exemption under MCL 2117.tt for the
properties located at 570 Clinton, 525 Clinton, 1326 St. Antoine, 1441 St. Antoine, 1400 St. Antoine.

The rationale for granting the Eligible Economic Development Group Property Tax Exemption under MCL 2117.tt is based on
exempting real and personal property of the eligible economic development group is deemed necessary to reduce unemployment,
promote economic growth, and increase capital investment in this state. An "eligible economic development group" means a
nonprofit organization the primary purpose of which is the economic development of real property or combining parcels of real
property for economic development purposes. The resolution to adopt the exemption may include terms and conditions of a
development agreement with the eligible economic development group that owns the specifically identi?ed real and personal

property.

The properties are being conveyed to Rock Economic Development Group (REDG) as consideration for the agreement of other
Rock entities to construct the new Wayne County Criminal Justice Center for Wayne County and to bear the cost in excess of the
available County funds. The County will continue to operate the current operation criminal justice facilities (Frank Murphy Hall of
Justice, Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center and Wayne County Division 1 and Division 2 Jails) with the exception of the
discontinued jail site under a $1.00 lease back to Wayne County until completion of the new Wayne County Criminal Justice
Center. Due to the Wayne County?s previous issuance of tax-exempt bond for the jail construction, the discontinued jail site had
to be separately conveyed to REDG to comply with IRS requirements and will not be subject to the $1.00 lease as it is not an
operational facility. The discontinued jail site will be held by REDG, will be demolished and will not be redeveloped until the
entirety of the current operation of the criminal justice facilities is vacated by Wayne County.

In addition, Wayne County has agreed that it will withdraw its millages from the exemption if the exemption is approved and
that property taxes levied by Wayne County be subject to the exemption. MCL 211.7tt (6) state not more than 45 days after
the state treasurer approves under subsection (5) a resolution adopted under subsection (1), the county in which the local tax
collecting unit that adopted the resolution under subsection (1) is located may by resolution elect to withdraw all mills levied by
that county from the exemption under this section. if a county elects to withdraw all mills levied by that county from the
exemption under this section, the local tax collecting unit shall levy and collect all mills levied by that county on the real and
personal property owned by an eligible economic development group identified in the resolution adopted under subsection

The properties meet the criteria set forth under MCL 211.7tt for the Eligible Economic Development Group Property Tax Exemption
based on exempting real and personal property of the eligible economic development group is deemed necessary to reduce
unemployment, promote economic growth, and increase capital investment in this state.

RE: Community Benefits Ordinance process analysis for the Ford Motor Company

Michigan Central Station/Corktown Development Project

BACKGROUND AND PROPOSAL

In November of 2016, the Proposal ballot initiative passed with 53% of the vote, effectuating
the enactment of the City of Detroit?s Community Bene?ts Ordinance (CBO) Ordinance No. 35-
16. The expressed purpose of this ordinance is to garner ?outreach and engagement that
promotes transparency and accountability and ensures development projects in the City of

Detroit bene?t and promote economic growth and prosperity for all residents. 

Section 14-12?3, subsection of the ordinance states that, ?the City Council shall appoint a
liaison from the Legislative Policy Division to monitor the community engagement process and
provide updates to the City Council. This report has been prepared by the Legislative Policy
Division (LPD) to provide an update as contemplated by the ordinance prior to Council?s

consideration of any ?nancial incentives associated with these developments.

The developer is seeking an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act Abatement (PA 146 of 2000),
Commercial Rehabilitation Act Abatement (PA 210 of 1995) and a Renaissance Zone Tax
Abatement (PA 376 of 1996) which would be applied respectively to various aspects of the
development, inclusive of the former Michigan Central Station, the former Brass Factory, and
the former DPS Book Depository Building, all of which are located in City Council District 6,
.which in addition to the anticipated investment amount of over $700 million dollars collectively,
quali?es these proposed developments as a Tier 1 development project and triggers the CBO

process. See. 14-12-2 of the CBO Ordinance de?nes a Tier '1 project as follows:

..




'3

?Tier 1 Development Project means a development project in the City that is expected to
incur the investment of Seventy?five Millions Dollars 75,000,000) or more during the
construction of facilities or to begin or expand operations or renovate structures where the
developer of the project is negotiating public support for investment in one or both of the
following forms.

(1 Any transfer to the developer of City-owned land parcels that have a cumulative
market value of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or more (as determined by the City
Assessor or independent appraisal) without open bidding and priced below market
rates (where allowed by law) or

(2) Provision or approval by the City of tax abatements or other tax breaks that abate
more than One Million Dollars $1 ,000,000) of City taxes over the term of the
abatement that inure directly to the Development, but not including Neighborhood
Enterprise Zone tax abatements.

Staff would also note that, while Neighborhood Enterprise Zone tax abatements are exempted as
being a qualifying factor for the CBO process, a Rehabilitation NEZ is being requested as a
?nancial tool for the redevelopment of the Michigan Central Station, located in City Council
District 6, given the residential component contemplated for the existing tower.

Ford Motor Company is seeking the transformation of the iconic Michigan Central Station,
located in City Council District 6, into the centerpiece of an innovation hub. Ford?s proposed
investment will include the development of a total of 1.2 million square feet of of?ce, retail,
parking and residential space to be housed in new and existing buildings within the Corktown
neighborhood. Ford Motor Company?s plans are centered around the rehabilitation of the historic
Michigan Central Station, located in City Council District 6, which is expected to include retail
and public Spaces in the Grand Hall, and commercial of?ce and residential space in the tower.

The subject requests to establish the respective districts for the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District, commercial rehabilitation district, Neighborhood Enterprise Zone, as well as the
Renaissance Zone will be before Your Honorable Body on Thursday, October 11, 2018 for their
respective required statutory public hearings.

The remainder of this report includes the analysis and conclusions of Council?s liaison?s report
for the proposed Michigan Central Station/Corktown redevelopment projects CBO process
which concluded on September 24, 2018. See details below:

COMMUNITY BENEFITS ORDINANCE PROJECT DETAILS
Proposed Development(s) and Location(s):

Michigan Central Station Parking Deck

The Michigan Central Station is located at 2001 15th Street in the Corktown neighborhood in
Southwest Detroit, located in City Council District 6. The rehabilitation is anticipated to include
retail and public spaces in the Grand Hall and commercial of?ce and residential space in the
tower. The upper floors consisting of the mezzanine through the eleventh floors is anticipated to
be developed as of?ce space. Floors twelve through thirteen are anticipated to be redeveloped as

2

for sale, market rate residential condominiums. The former concourse is anticipated to be
repurposed as a market space for local, regional and national retailers. A four story parking deck
is anticipated to be erected to the south of the subject property atop existing rail lines.

Former DPS Book Depository Building

The former DPS Book Depository Building is located at 2231 Dalzelle and also in the Corktown
neighborhood in Southwest Detroit adjacent to the Michigan Central Station site, located in City
Council District 6. This Albert Khan building is proposed to be rehabilitated to accommodate a
mixed-use development consisting of three stories of of?ce space and commercial and/or retail
space on the lower level.

Former Brass Factory Building

The former Brass Factory Building is located at 2200 Rosa Parks Boulevard in the Hubbard-
Richard community. Given the amount of environmental contamination associated with this site,
the property is slated for deconstruction and demolition. Embedded in the interior of this
commercial structure is a 19th century single family home, one of the oldest remaining examples
of 19th century architecture in the City of Detroit. Upon completion of the demolition, the site is
anticipated to be redeveloped into a multi-story mixed use of?ce/laboratory space.

North Michigan Avenue Parking Deck

This site is located near the intersection of Rosa Parks Boulevard and Cherry Avenue in the
Hubbard-Richard community. The site is currently vacant and undeveloped; however it is
anticipated to accommodate a multi-story parking deck.

Current Zoning:

Michigan Central Station M4 Intensive Industrial District. This district permits uses which
are usually objectionable and, therefore, the district is rarely, if ever, located adjacent to
residential districts. A broad range of uses is permitted in this district. New residences are
prohibited with the exception of loft conversions of existing buildings and of residential uses
combined in structures with permitted commercial uses. These requirements are to protect
residences from an undesirable environment and to ensure reservation of adequate areas for
industrial development.

Multiple use permits would have to be issued in order to accommodate the developer?s plan for
this proposed development. In order to facilitate a less laborious and multi?faceted permitting
process, the development might benefit from a Planned Development District zoning
classi?cation, in which speci?c stipulations and deve10pment standards may be imposed by City
Council.

Former DPS Book Depository Building Former Brass Factory Building M3 This district
is composed of property so situated as to be suitable for industrial development, but where the
modes of operation of the industry may affect any nearby residential uses. The purpose of this
district is to permit the normal operation of a majority of industries, subject only to those
regulations needed to control congestion and to protect nearby residential districts. No new
residential construction is permitted in this district with the exception of loft conversions of
existing buildings and of residential uses combined in structures with permitted commercial uses.

These requirements are to protect residences from an undesirable environment and to ensure
reservation of adequate areas for industrial development.

North Michigan Avenue Parking Deck B4 The B4 General Business District provides for
business and commercial uses of a thoroughfare-oriented nature. In addition to these uses, other
businesses, which may bene?t by drawing part of their clientele from passing traf?c are
permitted. Additional uses, which may be successfully blended with permitted by-right uses, are
conditional.

Developer Representatives:

Richard Bardelli (Ford Land), Mary Culler (Governmental Affairs), Gabby Bruno
(Governmental Affairs), Kelli P. Murphy (Of?ce of Tax Counsel), Shawn H. Wilson (Ford
Fund), and Aniela Kuzon (City of Tomorrow Challenge) on behalf of Ford Motor Company.

Estimated Cost:
$700,000,000.00 which quali?es this project as a Tier 1 project.

Census Tract(s):
5214 in addition to portions of 5215 to the north and 5208 and 9853 to the south.

Impact Area Boundaries:

The impact area, determined by the Planning and Development Department, is de?ned as Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard on the north, West Grand River Avenue and the northbound John C.
Lodge Service Drive on the east, W. Lafayette Boulevard on the south, and the 1-75 
Freeway and 21St Street on the west.

This report serves the following purposes:

1. Provides an update relative to the standing of the CBO process and to inform the City
Council as to what has transpired as a result of several meetings that have been held
thus far.

2. Provides the additional perspective of the legislative staff which may be considered
alongside the mandated PDD Director?s report submitted to Your Honorable Body for
review to complete the initial engagement phase of the CBO requirements.

3. The Legislative Policy Division respectfully offers recommendations to this
Honorable Body for potential areas of improvement in the CBO process based upon
observations and input during CBO proceedings.

CBO FIRST PUBLIC MEETING

The legally required public notice of the inaugural meeting (as required by Ordinance No. 35-16)
was mailed out to tax payers of record, occupants, and business owners within 300 radial feet of
the aforementioned impact area by the City Clerk?s of?ce on June 29, 2018. The notice was sent
to approximately 2,000 residents within the impact area. According to signatures collected by
PDD, one-hundred ?fty (150) assumed residents of the City of Detroit and the impact area were
recorded as having attended the ?rst meeting. Additionally, attendees were noti?ed of
subsequent NAC meetings slated to be held on July 30th, August 14th, August 27th, September
September l7?? and September 24th.

In addition, two separately held NAC meetings took place on Monday, July 16, 2018 and
Monday, July 30, 2018, The meeting schedule for the NAC was as follows: July 30, 2018,
August 14, 2018, August 27, 2018, September 27, 2018, September 10, 2018, September 14,
2018, September 17, 2018 and September 24, 2018.

The initial meeting was held on Monday, July 16, 2018 at 6:00 pm. at the Detroit Police Athletic
League (PAL) located at 1680 Michigan Avenue. Approximately one-hundred ?fty (150)
persons, inclusive of residents were in attendance at the initial meeting. Among those in
attendance were R. Steven Lewis (former PDD Central District Design Director), District 6
Council Member Raquel Casta?eda-L?pez, Mr. Vince Keenan of the Department of
Neighborhoods, and Ms. Sarah Pavelko a Director of Real Eastate and Financial Services for the
Detroit Economic Development Corporation.

At the initial meeting, an overview of the process was given by Ms. Gage which consisted of a
detailed overview of the ordinance, purpose and role of the NAC, all of which were clearly and
expertly articulated. Of concern was the fact that the dates for the proposed NAC meetings had
been predetermined, as had a number of concerns and impacts regarding the proposed
development, which the PDD presented as ?Identi?ed Potential Impacts for the Michigan Central
Station? as shown on page 11 of initial presentation. LPD staff is of the opinion that,
while the list of potential impacts as presented by PDD may have been relevant, such comments,
so early on appeared to direct the NAC towards a certain conclusion in regards to what bene?ts
and/or mitigating factors should be considered.

LPD staff is of the opinion that, while the ordinance only speci?cs one meeting as being required
between the NAC and the developer, that the NAC should have the authority and autonomy to
selected their own meeting dates and times.

The boundaries of the impact area were identi?ed as consisting of the Corktown, North
Corktown and the Hubbard?Richard communities being generally described as the area bounded
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard on the north, West Grand River Avenue and the northbound
John C. Lodge Service Drive on the east, W. Lafayette Boulevard on the south, and the 1-75
Freeway and 21St Street on the west. It was stated that anyone within the impact area
was eligible to be on the NAC. It was clearly stated that the role of the NAC was to serve the
greater community by representing those in the impact area by engaging and negotiating with the
administration and the developer to garner meaningful mitigation of issues and concerns which
may arise during the development process, and not to angle or negotiate for fringe bene?ts for
personal gain.

Arthur emison, Chief of Services and Infrastructure for the City of Detroit was in attendance at
the inaugural meeting of the Ford CBO process as well as at the Monday, July 16, 2018
independent NAC meeting as the of?cial representative for the administration, although the CBO
does not identify or recognize his role in the Community Bene?ts process. Mr. Jemison,
speaking on behalf of the administration, made some clarifying points, stating that the NAC
should consider other factors beyond mitigating factors associated with the proposed
developments. It was communicated by Mr. emison that there exists opportunities to realize
community bene?ts through the Strategic Neighborhood Core City Fund, the Affordable
Housing Leveraging Fund and Workforce Training and Development.

There were a number of concerns and considerations which were raised by members of the
public at the initial meeting, inclusive of but not limited to the following:
I The Impact area boundaries and whether they could be expanded.
Location of parking, traf?c impacts, the ownership of park lands.
Construction timeline.
Air-quality/demolition.

A cursory overview was given of the proposed developments by Mr. Richard Bardelli of Ford
Motor Company. The phasing and anticipated timelines, as well as impacts of all four
developments were articulated and reviewed with as much detail as was available. One omission
that LPD staff would like to note for future consideration is how the proposed development
meets the criteria of the CBO ordinance in terms of either investment amount, or tax incentive
being sought. In regard to this development, as well as others Book Tower, Monroe Block,
Wiggle, York/Cass) the CBO process has been initiated in order to meet State mandated ?ling
deadlines, prior to the developer having completed proforrnas, OPRA, Commercial
Rehabilitation, or other ?scal analysis, resulting in the prolonging or expediting of the CBO
process.

The timeline proposed for the NAC process associated with the Michigan Central Station and
Corktown DeveIOpment Projects in staff 8 assessment was enacted prematurely. As previously
stated, of concern was the fact that the developer did not have their proforma complete at the
onset of the CBO process, nor did they have a complete list of the tax incentives being sought,
nor the total investment amount for their proposed deveIOpments.

SELECTION OF THE NAC

At the initial CBO meeting held on Monday, July 16, 2018, approximately twenty?six (26)
residents of the Corktown, North Corktown and Hubbard-Richard neighborhoods expressed an
interest in serving on the Michigan Central Station/Corktown NAC. At the second CBO process
meeting which was held on July 30, 2018 approximately twenty-four (24) residents from the
respective communities expressed a continued interest in serving on the NAC. The twenty-four
(24) residents who expressed an interest at the July 30, 2018 meeting were from among the
initial twenty-six (26) residents from the July 16, 2018 meeting. In addition to hearing the
names, neighborhoods, and credentials for each of those interested in serving on the NAC for a
second time, another overview of the process and proposed developments was given, which in
essence protracted the process.

LPD staff would note, that many of previous recommendations have been incorporated
into the CBO process in terms of presenting information about the process, role of the NAC,
documents germane to the review and negotiations, etc.

The second meeting had four primary objectives:

1) Re-introduce the CBO process and legislation (again, repetitive and not all together
necessary).

2) Re-present the various aspects of the projects, i.e. the Michigan Central Station, the
former DPS Book Depository Buildings, the form Brass Factory Building and the
Michigan Avenue parking deck, located in City Council District 6.

3) Conduct the public selection process for two NAC members to be selected by the
community present.

4) Announce the selection results for two community selected NAC members.

Residents living in the impact area, who were interested in being a part of the NAC, were
advised to nominate themselves to serve on the NAC. Each candidate was required to provide
two nominations never selecting the same person twice, nor nominating themselves twice. Each
nominee also presented the case for their candidacy to serve on the NAC. Nominees names were
collected and documented by PDD staff.

Once all ballots were received from voting residents residing in the defined impact area, the
votes were tallied by PDD with members of Council staff, LPD, DON, and the Mayor?s of?ce
overseeing the nominee selection tally. The selections for both Council President Jones and
Council Member Ayers were also announced at the meeting of July 30, 2018. While the two
appointees from the two At?Large Council Members did not self?nominate, past practice has
allowed Council Members to select residents from within the impact area to serve on the NAC.
If this practice is to continue into the future, staff is of the opinion that it should be codified in
the Community Bene?ts Ordinance.

MICHIGAN CENTRAL STATION CORKTOWN NEIGHBORHOOD ADVISORY
COUNCIL MEETINGS

During the NAC meetings, there were several themes, or major points of concern and discussion
including but not limited to:

i The amount of parking and where parking will be located within the project area,

I Construction and the development schedule,

I Completion of construction and the move in date for future tenants/residents,

I The number of affordable units and the de?nition of what is considered affordable,

. The possibility of the deconstruction of the former Brass Factory rather than demolition
given the historical home which the factory was built around,

I The status of and future plans for Roosevelt Park, etc.

Attached please ?nd the PDD report which accurately details all of the NAC concerns and the
developer?s responses. In all there were a total of ten (10) community meetings held in regards
to this CBO process.

COMMUNITY BENEFITS

The Ford Neighborhood Advisory Council submitted a letter of support for the Ford Motor
Company?s commitments to the CBO requests, dated September 27, 2018. The letter is
attached as a part of the PDD CBO staff report. The letter states in part:

?The M4 is pleased to offer this letter of support to confirm the attached "Ford-?Cit? Responses
to Impacts as identified :51? Ford Neighborhood .ldi't'smj: Committee September 2016??
document accurately reflects our understanding of the agreed upon community bene?ts to be
included in the development agreement for this project. 

Ford Motor Company has committed to making a signi?cant investment of over $700 million
dollars in the Corktown campus which is anticipated to bring 5,000 jobs to Detroit and revitalize
one of the City?s greatest historical assets, the Michigan Central Station, located in City Council
District 6. Ford?s proposed investment is intended to make Detroit ?the center of the ?lture of
mobility.? In addition, by leveraging available incentives, it is anticipated that the development
of the long vacant Michigan Central Station will generate $300 million dollars of new tax
revenue for the City of Detroit.

Ford has committed to invest in key programs that meet the needs of Corktown and Southwest
Detroit such as the Strategic Neighborhood Core City Fund, the Affordable Housing Leveraging
Fund and Workforce Training and Development as detailed below. With an initial commitment
of $10 million dollars, the funds proposed to be provided by Ford are anticipated to leverage
other available public and private resources for a total investment of $22.5 million dollars
according to the Duggan administration.

Speci?cally, Ford?s investment in the community will include the following funding and is
anticipated to accomplish the following goals:

Create and protect affordable housing in the impact area to help existing residents
0 $2.5 million dollars to the Affordable Housing Leveraging Fund to
Preserve and/or create approximately 200 new units of affordable housing in impact
area.

Support neighborhood development

- Neighborhood park improvements, to be determined through the neighborhood
planning process.

- Streetscape and mobility improvements, including traf?c engineering studies,
pedestrian and cyclist improvements and other changes to be determined through the
neighborhood planning process.

- Financial support to help income eligible homeowners secure 0% home repair loans
and help eligible seniors secure emergency home repair grants.

Financial support for a facade improvement program for impact area businesses
through Motor City Restore.

- Set aside portion for a community advised fund.

Ensure impact area residents have increased access to training and job opportunities
0 $5 million dollars for workforce training, education and development.

- $1 million dollars to Vocational Center to help train both adult and youth
for emerging technology jobs.

- $1 million dollars to Grow Detroit Young Talent.

- $1 million dollars to support other training programs for in demand skilled trades jobs
through Detroit at Work.

- $2 million dollars in funds to be invested in: workforce development programs;
scholarships and programs for impact area youth pursuing careers in 
entrepreneurship and other community programs to be decided upon with community
input.

I Create a local hiring hall, an established entry point for Detroit residents with priority to
impact area residents to apply for Ford jobs openings and to be referred to job training
resources as needed. *This location will be identi?ed at a later date.

Ford is also proposing a number of additional community bene?ts for the impact area which are
detailed in the attached PDD report beginning on page 24.

ANALYSIS

CBO Timeline

Both the public and the NAC members raised concerns about the aggressive timeline in the CBO
process for the NAC to meet and produce recommendations for a list of community bene?ts.
However, there were considerations given to the NAC, as well as to the developer to allow for
additional time when needed. At the scheduled fourth meeting the NAC was expected to provide
a draft list of concerns and recommendations to the developer; however, by this point, they still
had not been informed of all of the abatements being sought, nor the extent of the demolition and
remediation needed at either the Michigan Central Station or the former Brass Factory building.

CBO Process

Many of the observations stated in this section of the report are duplicative of those expressed in
previous LPD reports, sach as those regarding the Detroit Pistons, Palace Sports and
Entertainment Corporate Headquarters and Practice Facility, Herman Kiefer Complex, Hudson
Site Transformative Brown?eld and OPRA redevelopment CBO process.

1. Extend the CBO meeting timeline

CBO development projects should be granted more time for a more extensive
engagement and negotiation process. The timeline as it stands does not have the
necessary amount oftinie built in for thoughtful requests or responses from either the
NAC or developer. The language in the CBO does state in part . .the Planning Director
where possible shall submit the initial Community Bene?ts Report within six weeks from
the date the notice is sent of the public meeting.? While this language does allow for
some ?exibility, the six week timeline was ultimately adhered to in this case, in order to
present these items to the City Council prior to your winter recess. LPD staff strongly
believes that the CBO process should not begin until the proforma and all applications for
establishment of districts are complete.

Re?ne the process

There are portions of the ordinance that leave much to interpretation, such as if the
requests of the NAC should be limited to the remediation plan of the developer or
germane to employment opportunities for members of the community as a result of the
project. One interpretation has been that any bene?t conceived by the community is ?fair
play" and should be considered by the developer. Staff would request Your Honorable
Body to further deliberate on the intent of the CEO in this respect. One sentiment that
was repeated time and time again during this process is that the role of the NAC does not
end with the issuance of the Community Bene?ts Report, however, should continue
through the course of the development. Is it the expectation of Council that the appointed
NAC members remain empaneled for the duration of the development or that a sunset
provision be added to the ordinance as it relates to the role of the 

If the Department of Neighborhoods (DON) is to play a vital role in the CBO moving
forward, then their role needs to be de?ned and codi?ed in the Ordinance.

vary from project to project in terms of composition and utility. In the case of the
Michigan Central Station/Corktown CBO process, the NAC opted to select a chair to
facilitate the meetings and move the NAC towards their ultimate recommendations. In
other CBO processes, there was no clear or de?ned chair, and the administration served
more of a role in guiding the discussion for the NAC, rather than the NAC. Staff is of the
opinion that the NAC selection process should be amended so a chairperson is identi?ed
for the NAC in order to ensure that there is no undue influence from non-NAC or impact
area third parties.

CONCLUSION

Ford Moto Company has submitted their commitments in regards to the Michigan Central
Station CBO process, which are being incorporated into a development agreement between the
developer and the administration. This report has been submitted in an effort to aid Your
Honorable Body in your deliberations ahead of the Thursday. October 1 l, 2018 Planning and
Economic Development Standing Committee, at which time. Your Honorable Body will he
considering the request of Ford Motor Company in regards to the establishment of a PA 210 Tax
Abatement District, PA 146 OPRA Tax Abatement District, NEZ Rehabilitation Tax Abatement
District and Renaissance Zone Tax Abatement District respectively.

Should you have any additional questions in this regard, please contact the of?ces of the
Legislative Policy Division directly.

Mobility Agreement

 

Ford agrees to communicate its intended mobility experiments in the
neighborhood. including automated vehicles and vehicle sharing. and to offer
opportunities for feedback and first-access to pilot programs designed at the
Corktown campus. The impact area wants the opportunity to try something first, or
to say it doesn't want to try something.

 

Bene?ts and agreements that are provided directly by Ford

 

Ford agrees to recognize the NAC as an official decision-making council and to
meet on a regular basis for at least the next 10 years (the governance of which is
outlined below in section 4).

 

- Ford agrees to communicate its intended mobility experiments in the
neighborhood. including automated vehicles and vehicle sharing. and to offer
opportunities for feedback and ?rst-access to pilot programs designed at the
Corktown campus (the impact area wants the opportunity to try something first. or
to say it doesn't want to try something).

 

- Ford will assess the ability to save the John Warren House that was built in
approximately 1870 (making it one of the oldest houses in Corktown and in the city
as a whole). that was originally occupied by a co-founder of the Detroit institute of
Arts, and that exists inside of the Lincoln Brass Factory that it plans to demolish
and build over. If the house is found to not be contaminated, Ford will either
deconstruct and salvage its materials. build around the house, or move the house
to a new location. See 
treasure.html for history on and images nf the hnlicn

Agreements on the future governance of the NAC, its relationship with
Ford. and its guidance of the funds

 

 

 

Ford Community Bene?t Agreement - September 16, 2018

 

This is a for-example scenario to illustrate what a future NAC might look like: The
NAC consists of 9 members and 1 alternate, 2 of which were elected and 8 of
which were appointed by City Council and the Planning Department. Moving
forward the NAC will consist of 9 members with 6 members appointed by the
Corktown, North Corktown, and Hubbard-Richard community organizations (each
choosing 2), and 3 members selected by a combination of City Council and the
Planning Department. The neighborhood organizations can choose to have a
popular vote in whatever format they wish. Elections and appointments will
happen on an annual basis starting in January of 2019. The original NAC will
serve until then to help the process transition. Original NAC members can run
again if they choose. NAC members appointed by the City Council or Planning
Department will be term limited to one year unless they are voted in. The NAC will
relate community concerns to Ford and vice versa, and will be responsible for
directing the annual expenditure of the Grant Fund within the bene?t areas outline
in section 1. Expenditures will be agreed upon if they receive a 5-4 vote. The NAC
will not directly receive applications or make decisions about the loans coming out
of the Permanent Fund, which will be managed by a trusted third-party chosen by
the NAC, but it will monitor the kinds of loans being given and the success of their
repayment as well as the overall growth of the fund. Allowable uses of the
Permanent Fund can be edited, removed, or added to by a 7-2 vote of the NAC,
including voting to change who manages and administers the loans. The NAC
cannot vote to spend down the principal in the fund as its foundational intent is to
survive into the future, even if Ford were to leave and the train station was to go
empty again 100 years in the future.

FORD COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROPOSAL

 

Ford?s significant investment of over $700 million in a Corktown campus will bring 5.000 jobs to Detroit and revitalize one
of the City's greatest historic assets, Michigan Central Station. Ford's investment will make Detroit the center of the future
of mobility. In addition, by leveraging available incentives, the development of the long vacant Michigan Central Station
will generate $300 million of new tax revenue for the City of Detroit.

Ford Motor Company was built on the belief that freedom of movement drives human progress. It is a belief that has
always fueled our passion to create great cars and trucks, a thriving workplace and a commitment to the communities in
which we do business.

The Corktown community is a critical partner in our vision as we create an innovation hub for the future of transportation
and we make a commitment to join the community as a neighbor for many years to come. Ford is excited about the oppor-
tunity to continue to work to make people?s lives better. and we believe that with other partners and the community, we
can build tomorrow together.

Under Detroit's Community Benefits Ordinance. Ford proposes the following community benefits and construction impact
mitigation to the Neighborhood Advisory Council. These benefits both respond to the community?s requests and build on
Ford?s values which include putting people first, equity. inclusiveness. and innovation. These investments complement our
already $l4+ million annual support from Ford?s philanthropic arm, the Ford Fund. to Detroit.

Re: Neighborhood Advisory Council Letter of Support for the Ford Community Benefits Proposal
Mr. Jemison:

The Ford Neighborhood Advisory Council (the was established on Tuesday, August 14, 2018
forthe purpose of participating in the Community Benefits Process, as required by the Detroit
Community Benefits Ordinance. As part of the Community Benefits Process, the NAC meet with Ford
Motor Company, City staff, and members of the public to better understand Ford Motor Company's
proposed Corktown investment project, hear community concerns, and ultimately provide a list of
concerns to the development team.

Ford Motor Company has acquired the iconic Michigan Central Station and plans to transform it into
the centerpiece of a vibrant innovation hub for the future of transportation. This hub will provide an
opportunity for Ford and its partners to work on autonomous and electric vehicles and design urban
mobility solutions. Ford Motor Company's Tier 1 Development Project (the ?Project") will include the
development of 1.2 million square feet of office, retail, parking, and residential space to be housed
in new and existing buildings within the Corktown neighborhood.

The NAC is pleased to offer this letter of support to confirm the attached "Ford/City Responses to
Impacts as Identified by Ford Neighborhood Advisory Committee September 26th, 2018"
document accurately reflects our understanding of the agreed upon community benefits to be
included in the development agreement for this project.

The NAC supports this package with the commitment that a rticipatory budgeting"
allocation of Ford?s Strategic Neighborhood Fund donation (g?jmillion) will be placed into a fund
managed by a to be named independent fiduciary. Th' cl will grow over time from interest
proceeds and from voluntary contributions by indiviggals. businesses, and organizations who care to
donate to the fund, and the original prinmp kwiifl?b?? preserved. Proposals for grants from the fund
will be submitted by community 3 within the impact area, who will be kept informed
about the size of the fund and how??(?u (h of it is available for grants in a given year. The chosen
fiduciary will allocate grants ning projects on an annual basis through a participatory process
to be determined with @?rr?iut and feedback of the community. Further, the NAC supports this
package with the comm tmentfrom the Ford Motor Company to continue engagement with the NAC,
Impact Area residents, and the broader community for as long as the Company in the neighborhood,
even though the formed community benefits proposal development process has come to an end.

The Ford Neighborhood Advisory Council Est. 2018

The NAC actively engaged the public throughout this process to solicit community feedback about
the Project via Facebook, email, conversations with residents, community surveys, and public
community meetings. The purpose of this engagement was to develop an informed Community
Benefits proposal that best represents our understanding of community needs. As a result, the Ford
Neighborhood Advisory Committee provided the Community Impacts matrix to Ford Motor Company
and City of Detroit staff on September 16, 2018. This document was reviewed with the public on at
the Community Benefit Public Meeting held on Monday, September 17, 2018, from 6:00pm to
8:00pm at IBEW on 1358 Abbott St.

At the Community Benefit Public Meeting held on Monday, September 24, 2018, at IBEW, the
NAC met with Ford Motor Company, City staff, and members of the public to review the Ford Motor
Company Community Benefits Proposal, Ford's response to the NAC Community Impact matrix. After
reviewing the proposal and public comment the NAC voted unanimously to support Ford Motor
Company Community Benefits Proposal.

The NAC welcomes Ford Motor Company to Corktown and looks forward to working with members of
theCity's administration and the Ford Motor Company team to create a stronger community for all.

Sincerely,

text message alert, in addition to coordination with Police and Fire, in an event of a leak
that would require an evacuation.

House located within Brass Factory was raised by NAC as an important artifact. Could these
materials be tested for contamination and if safe, deconstructed to be reconstructed, or the
materials repurposed at the site in some manner to preserve the old home and the historic
legacy of the community.

Can the Corktown Historical Society be involved in the evaluation of old home, or the
materials of the old that do remain?

Public Questions

Issues relative to truck traffic raised, particular to Rosa Parks and North Corktown
Community member states that he understood that vapors were detected at 44 times the
allowable State level at the Brass Factory and is concerned about gasses during demo

A number of questions relative to known contaminates in the building, what happens if
there is a leak or spill over (evacuation plan), and associated alerts and clean up activates.
These questions will all be addressed in the Environmental Protection Plan that 
will produce and post publicly on the CBO site and facebook. This plan will include a plan
should a natural disaster, such as a tornado, were to interfere with remediation at the site.
Asbestos is raised as a concern and remediation of asbestos will take place in a vacuum,
contained environment. Asbestos wet to prevent fibers to spread. Special disposal of
asbestos required in certified landfill. Air and all surfaces inspected after remediation.
Requests for clarification around about hours of operation due to construction noise.
Damage to roads from construction and installation of fiber or other underground repairs.

Incentives Breakdown, Timeline DEGC

Sarah Pavelko of the DEGC provides an overview of the incentives being requested for the
Ford?s Corktown investment

DEGC utilizes a model that includes factors such as investment cost, jobs, development
square footage, utility costs to determine a report of the net benefit the City will receive
from a project. The benefit is calculated by an evaluation permit fees, sales tax, property
tax value, income tax, etc.

A breakdown of each incentive and the anticipated request under each program provided

Location - IBEW: 1358 Abbott St, Detroit, MI 48226
Meeting Notes

Community Roundtable Discussions - Breakout Tables

Meeting participants broke out into a number of small groups of 4 or 5

Breakout activity led by NAC members, City staff, and Citizen Detroit to gather top three
concerns per resident under two topics what construction related issues are most
concerning and what benefit would be most valued in the community.

Reports collected to be summarized and discussed at CBO Meeting #6 at the Gaelic League
on Michigan Avenue on Friday, September 14 at 6pm.

Public Comment

Community residents from outside of the Impact Area, but also residents of Southwest
Detroit, felt that the community engagement activity was exclusive in that the activity sheet
expressly asked for benefits that would only impact neighborhoods within the impact area.
Residents complained that Southwest Detroit is larger than just Corktown and that other
areas should have been considered for the receipt of benefits and the input activity
excluded residents who came to participate from outside of the Impact Area.

Comment was made that there has been no negotiation with the developer on the
community benefits. The back and forth of negotiation has been lost and it is a key to the
process.

The survey that was distributed by the NAC did not have a location on the flier on where to
return the flier to.

embarked upon to collect feedback including community meetings, Facebook, phone calls,
conversations, a survey, and email.

All of this information collected via these various methods were collected into a spreadsheet and
arranged in buckets of similar type. The NAC then took this information and began developing
proposals for Ford. These proposals included several main themes and commitment amounts for Ford to
consider funding. The purpose ofthis meeting was to review these proposals in a public form and collect
comments from the community.

The NAC reviewed the proposals that were to be considered, such as, but not limited to: funds for home
repair, childhood development and educational programs, workforce development and training,
resident driven funds for various projects, a communication plan with Ford with emphasis on
environmental plan, park improvements, programs to impact retention of neighborhood character,
residents, and small businesses.

RE: Real Property at 12412, 12418, 12420, 12430 and 12436 Van Dyke, Detroit, MI

48234 and if any Medical Marihuana uses under the MMFLA would be

permissible.

This report is in response to an inquiry made by Council Member Scott Benson at the Flaming
and Economic Development Standing Committee meeting of Thursday, October 4, 2018 in
regarding to the above referenced properties, which are subject to a pending purchase agreement

between the City of Detroit and Mr. Ryan Riddle.

The question at hand is whether the subject properties could at any point and time be utilized for
a medical marihuana related use under the provisions of the Medical Marihuana Facilities
Licensing Act (MMFLA) and the City of Detroit Zoning Ordinance. LPD staff has reviewed the
provisions of the City of Detroit?s Medical Marihuana provisions which will take effect on
Monday, October 15, 2018 and have determined that two of the five medical marihuana related

uses may be permissible.

The current zoning classification of the subject properties is B4 (General Business District)
which could allow either a Provisioning Center Facility, or a Safety Compliance Facility.

Sec. 61-3-355 states:

?Medical marihuana provisioning center facilities may be permitted on a conditional basis and SD2 zoning districts but must not be permitted in any
zoning district if the citywide total number of legally established provisioning centerfacilities

and medical marihuana caregiver centers for which a building permit or certi?cate of
compliance has been issued is equal to or greater than seventy-?ve 75 

While the City of Detroit has yet to issue licenses for medical marihuana provisioning centers
under the newly adopted zoning scheme, LPD staff notes that there is a religious institution
within 1,000 radial feet of the subject properties which would preclude the property owner from
establishing a provisioning center at the subject location. Exodus Missionary Baptist Church
located at the intersection of Castle Avenue and Kenney Street is approximately 960 radial feet
from the subject parcels. Sec. states:

medical marihuana caregiver center or medical marihuana provisioning center facility must
not be located in any of the One thousand (1,000) radial feet from any zoning
lot occupied by any religious institution identified as exempt by the City 

The City of Detroit Assessor?s Of?ce shows Exodus Baptist Church being located at 8173
Kenney Street as being tax exempt. Should at any point in time the property located at 8173
Kenney Street lose its tax exempt status, there does not appear to be any other barriers to the
subject properties located at 12412-12436 Van Dyke being utilized as a medical marihuana
provisioning center.

Sec. 61-3-355 states: ?Medical marihuana safety compliance facilities may be permitted
on a conditional basis and SD2 zoning districts,?

Given that there are no spacing or concentration restrictions associated with medical marihuana
safety compliance facilities under the provisions of Chapter 61 of the Detroit City Code, should
the property owner be able to secure licensing from the State of Michigan, they could be
permitted to operate such a facility at this location.

If Council has any other questions or concerns regarding the subject, LPD will be happy to
provide further research and analysis upon request.
