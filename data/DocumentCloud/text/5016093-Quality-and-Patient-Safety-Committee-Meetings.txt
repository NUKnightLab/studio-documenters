Star Ratings Overview;
Scoring and Weighting is Complex;

 Interventions by Measure Group.

Following the review of the information, Director Junge inquired further regarding engaging leadership as
an intervention. She asked whether the administration will be walking union leadership at all levels
through the scores and explaining what they mean. Dr. Shannon responded that the administration is
trying to do this across the organization. It has been shared at the monthly leadership forum and with
physician leadership and nurse managers; it will also be shared at the upcoming monthly labor leadership
meeting.
Director Driscoll inquired whether any of the hospital-wide committees are led by registered nurses; she
also offered this as a suggestion, if not currently being done. Dr. Shannon stated that there are several
sub-groups within nursing that are working on the nursing-sensitive indicators - hospital-acquired
conditions, in particular. As part of this, periodically the executive sponsor is sitting down with the
manager of each unit to discuss unit performance. Information is shared with each unit about not only
their patient experience scores but also other dimensions. It is stressed to them that the information that
the nurse managers receive should be shared with their bedside nurses at their huddles. This information
includes not only the local scores on patient experience surveys, but also includes specific information,
positive or negative, that the patients reflect in the free-text areas of the surveys.
