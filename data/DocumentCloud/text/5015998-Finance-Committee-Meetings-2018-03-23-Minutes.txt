 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Douglas Elwell, Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided additional information.
With regard to request number 3, Mr. Jones noted that an error was corrected on the transmittal. The correct grant
renewal amount is reflected as $88,125.00, and the correct contract period is from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2020.
Director Richardson-Lowry stated that she is recusing herself from the discussion and vote on request number 4.
Mr. Jones commented on requests 5 through 13; these consist of increases and extensions to existing contracts. They
are listed as non-competitive processes, because although the original contracts are procured under a competitive
methodology such as a Request for Proposals or under the Group Purchasing Organization, when it is subsequently
extended or increased, it is done so based on Supply Chain Management’s knowledge of needing to leverage the
existing contract. The Procurement Policy allows for this to be done, with Board approval when necessary. In most
cases, the cost basis for services and unit pricing for supplies are the same.
With regard to request number 12, Mr. Elwell provided information on the different components to be received under
the request, relating to licensing fees, adding or changing interfaces, and those needed due to regulatory requirements
that did not exist at the time the original contract was negotiated and executed. Director Richardson-Lowry noted that
there are other methodologies, such as fixed price and sum certain, that can be employed when negotiating contracts
like this to reduce the likelihood of coming back with contract increases/amendments; she encouraged him to think
about utilizing the methodology of sum certain with module changes in future contracts. Mr. Elwell noted that the
administration is still negotiating with the vendor; this was originally a request for a $9 million increase but was
reduced by $4 million.
Donna Hart, Chief Information Officer, provided additional information. In response to a question regarding whether
CCHHS’ costs for these services are comparable to what other institutions pay, she stated that she is currently
exploring that question. She stated that CCHHS has a full suite of products; she needs to compare it to an institution
using the same components/products/interfaces.
With regard to request number 13, Director Richardson-Lowry requested information on the original Minority and
Women-Owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) goals set and status of the vendor’s compliance. Mr. Jones responded
that he will provide this information.
With regard to the subject of Contract Compliance and M/WBE goals, Acting Chairman Hammock inquired whether a
report will be provided going forward to track Contract Compliance efforts more closely. Mr. Jones responded
affirmatively; he stated that he is developing metrics that he plans to present in the near future.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Reiter, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 24, as amended, and subject to completion of review by
Contract Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Richardson-Lowry abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 4.

C. Any items listed under Section III

 IV. Report from Chief Procurement Officer
A. 1st Quarter FY2018 Report of Purchases made under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer
(Attachment #2)
B. Report of emergency purchases
Mr. Jones provided an overview of the 1st Quarter FY2018 Report of Purchases made under the authority of the
Chief Executive Officer.
There were no emergency purchases that were recently made.

V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
• Metrics
• Financials through January 2018
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the information contained in his report. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Mr. Elwell noted that, in the future, they are going to break the financials down to show: 1) financial information
regarding activities relating to detainees and Public Health; 2) financials as a provider; and 3) financials as
CountyCare. By being able to see all three (3) pieces, it will make it easy to track where problems may exist.
During the discussion of the CountyCare financials, it was noted that March 31st is the last day for members to
change plans. Mr. Elwell stated that the administration should receive the data relating to membership changes
some time before the April Finance Committee Meeting. Acting Chairman Hammock requested that a budget line
that reflects year-to-date data be added to the CountyCare financials so there is a benchmark to measure against.

VI.

Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Acting Chairman Hammock declared the meeting
ADJOURNED.

Respectfully submitted,
Finance Committee of the
Board of Directors of the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System
