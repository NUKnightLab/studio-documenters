Funding Source: Road and Bridge Fund
Thomas Pavich, Department of Public Works, presented. Dennis Kennedy asked Lenora Lockett if she was
comfortable with this previously held award recommendation and the process utilized for this purchase.
Lenora Lockett said that the department did their additional due diligence to reach out to a wider
audience to provide the opportunity to counter the trade-in value, which received no response, but
believes this is the best option available to complete this purchase. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve
the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-540 was unanimously approved.
The following item was held at the request of the Board members.
BC2019-541
Department of Human Resources, recommending an award on RQ45827 and enter into a sole source
contract with The Jellyvision Lab, Inc. in the amount not-to-exceed $132,972.00 for ALEX virtual benefits
counselor software subscription services for Cuyahoga County Employee Benefits Open Enrollment for
the period 7/22/2019 – 10/7/2020.
Funding Source: Benefits Administration
Holly Woods, Department of Human Resources, presented. Dale Miller asked if the next Open Enrollment
is ready for implementation and asked how individual users of this software could feel confident that they
are being directed to the best plan rather than the plan that is more advantageous to the County; and
asked what the difference between the Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and Exclusive Provider
Organization (EPO) Plans are.
Joseph Nanni asked who determines what type of data goes into the system, which is the core component
of the software, as it is relative to the recommended plan offered to the employee, which could potentially
favor the County’s interests; asked if County costs are analyzed when recommending a plan; asked if the
recommendation is based solely on the best plan for the employee relative to health care services and
cost; asked if there is a link between this system and the Infor system; and asked if employees are required
to use this software.
Trevor McAleer asked if the cost is on a per employee basis or flat fee per year; asked what is the cost per
employee and if this will be available year round and not just during Open Enrollment; asked if there will
be tracking on employee use and if the County will be charged for only those employees utilizing the
system; and asked for clarification on the sole source procurement process and asked how the County
can be sure that this is the only provider for these services.
Lenora Lockett confirmed that this was posted to the County’s website for the required 5-day period as a
sole source purchase, as stated in Ms. Woods presentation.

 Mr. McAleer asked how the department became aware of this this vendor and determined them to be a
sole source provider of these services; and asked if the vendor’s claim as a sole source provider is due to
the ability to recommend a plan based on the data input.
Ms. Lockett explained that the sole source process is based on specific needs to achieve the overarching
goal of the department and a process including a public posting to solicit responses to services being
sought; and stated that the vendor must provide a sole source affidavit stating that no other vendor can
provide services.
Mr. McAleer agreed with Ms. Lockett that this is the policy to conduct a sole source purchase but posting
to the website for 5 days is not a guarantee that the purchase is a true sole source because it may not be
viewed by all potential vendors in the 5-day period; asked if Oswald Companies, the County’s healthcare
consultant, has reviewed this request.
Joseph Nanni asked if registered Buyspeed vendors for related services are also contacted in addition to
the sole source posting.
Ms. Lockett stated that is not a requirement of the standard procedure for a sole source purchase and
restated that it is based on the department’s specific service need.
Mr. Miller asked if this is the first time the County will be using this tool and if the contract provides for
renewal options if this system proves beneficial; and asked why benefit counselors were not well-received
by employees in prior years.
Dennis Kennedy asked if this vendor is insured for liability in the event a recommendation may not be
suitable for the employee in terms of cost and services; asked if costs are incorporated into the
recommendation and how does the system know what the costs will be to the employee; asked if the
system will store the employee information and if there is the potential for privacy issues in the event of
a security breach.
Mr. Kennedy asked for clarification on the backup materials and for confirmation that this received
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) approval.
Mr. McAleer asked why the system would recommend any other plan besides MetroHealth, which is the
least expensive plan offered to employees; and expressed his concern over identifying this contract as a
sole source.
Mr. Kennedy asked if the Department of Law has an opinion on this issue. Jered Zibritosky, Department
of Law, indicated that he would need to research this matter and did not have an opinion at this time.
Ms. Lockett stated that the Board has the discretion to proceed with an award based on an RFP exemption
rather than sole source and they also have the option to hold this item; said that there are additional
procurement methods that may be utilized such as a formal Request for Proposals; however at this point
there is not enough time to conduct a formal process; and further stated that a Request for Proposals
should always be the default procurement process.

 Mr. Kennedy asked if this contract must be effective on 7/22/2019 or can this be delayed; asked when
Open Enrollment begins; asked why this request had not been submitted earlier to allow for potential
delays, which would not interfere with Open Enrollment.
Mr. McAleer recommended that this item be held for one week. Mr. Miller asked if a one-week delay
would still allow for Open Enrollment to occur on time.
Mr. Kennedy stated that he will work with County Council members to resolve the outstanding questions
related to this item and recommended to hold the request for one week. The remaining Board members
concurred with Mr. Kennedy’s recommendation.
BC2019-542
Department of Public Safety and Justice Services/Office of Emergency Management, recommending an
award on RQ45489 and enter into a contract with JH Consulting, LLC of West Virginia in the amount notto-exceed $26,046.00 for Multi-Regional Emergency Operations Center Exercise services for the period
7/22/2019 – 2/28/2020.

 Mark Griffin, Agency of the Inspector General, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if this service is similar to
a contract with Everlaw for the Department of Law that was previously approved by the Board and
commented that this contract appears to be less costly than Everlaw. Dale Miller asked if this is a new
service. Dale Miller motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-545 was
unanimously approved.
