The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records evidencing
payments and a balance in the account as of June 10, 2013 in the amount of $166,222.06

Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the SelfInsurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator in accordance
with the terms of the aforementioned court order. From July 22, 2008 to date, inclusive of

special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County
Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not
be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application
with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class
change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at
that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case
may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
Sspecial circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification
(TEERM) Program:
In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under
the TEERM Program if there has been no purchase for value and
the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for
at least 12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along
with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program.

Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program:
In the instance where real estate does not meet the

municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify finding that the
property is deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the
SER Program if:
A.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has
been at the same location for a minimum of ten years prior
to the date of application for the SER Program;

B.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises
submits evidence of hardship supporting a determination
that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the

imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused; and

C.

The applicant is not receiving another Cook County
property tax incentive for the same property.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the
specification of the special circumstances, and a determination

the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of
the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant
must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal
Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior
to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b
and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of
an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances
exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed

of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal
is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is
not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall
instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the
County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program
under a Class 6b application must be received by the Assessor’s
Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual
reports by recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the
SER Program as to the use of the property and the number of
persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients
shall be required to certify whether the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues
its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required
to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise
that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application
ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be
forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of the County
Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the
affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor’s rules shall result in loss of the
incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling. Additionally, if
the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of

 FINANCE AGENDA
JULY 17, 2013
PAGE 54
the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the
Class 6b incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall
terminate.
d. e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the
date such new construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such
substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or
in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial
reoccupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the
TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the
case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this
classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date
of the notice of approval, or until the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases
operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the
SER Program, Tthis incentive may be renewed during the last year
a property is entitled to a 160 percent assessment level pursuant to
section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:

e. g.

1. A.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor’s Office of intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality or
the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2. B.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board, if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating
that the municipality or the County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and
supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b; and

3. C.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal
application are filed with the Office of the Assessor’s
Office before the expiration of the 160 percent assessment
level period.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM
Program or SER Program are not renewable. For all other Class 6b
incentives, tThe number of renewal periods is not limited as long
as the property continues to apply and qualify meet the
requirements for Class 6b. Any property owner that applies for
Class 6b treatment on or before the adoption date of this
Ordinance change will be eligible for this renewal term at the end
of their original incentive period subject to the above
requirements. If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving
Class 6b treatment, but the assessment level is higher than 16
percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above

 FINANCE AGENDA
JULY 17, 2013
PAGE 55
and receive a 16 percent assessment level for the prescribed period
beginning after the filing and approval of the Resolution and
renewal application. However, if, as of November 23, 1999, the
taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is
granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no
reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the
incentive will be granted.

f. h.

A copy of tThe notice of intent to request for renewal which is
filed with the Assessor's Office of the incentive will be forwarded
by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to members of the County Board from the eaffected
districts.

g. i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over
the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64(7). After expiration
of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

h.

Additionally, for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated
buildings and other structures to qualify for a Class 6b
classificationincentive, an eligibility Class 6b application must be
made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement
of such new construction or substantial rehabilitation. With
respect to abandoned property, the eligibility Class 6b application
must be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the
reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

i. j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection
necessary to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to
determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 6b.

j. k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial
reassessment reports by all Class 6b recipients as to the use of the
property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site.
A copy of sSuch reports shall will be verified forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to members of the County Board from the affected
districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by
the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the
period relating to the nonfiling.
