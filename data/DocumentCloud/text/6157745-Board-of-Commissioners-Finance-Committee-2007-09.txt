PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO CHAPTER 2
ARTICLE VII OF THE COOK COUNTY CODE
WHEREAS, it is crucial that the people of the County of Cook have trust,
respect and confidence in those who are elected to public office; and
WHEREAS, it is equally crucial that the citizenry have absolute faith in the
integrity of the electoral process by which our public officials are chosen ; and
WHEREAS, to accomplish this, the County of Cook has adopted certain rules
and regulations including campaign finance laws that establish, among other
things, limitations on the amounts of political contributions that may be made by
individuals and entities doing business with the County, reg istered lobbyists and
other entities that have an interest in influencing the policies and decisions of
County government; and
WHEREAS, these laws limit the amount of money that such individuals and
entities may contribute to candidates for public office to $1 ,500 during a single
candidacy and $3,000 during an election year; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the elected officials within the County of Cook to
reduce the ability of entities to brazenly ignore these limitations, thereby
restoring faith in the integrity of the electoral process and the candidates who
might otherwise benefit from these abuses; and

contribution methods; and
WHEREAS, this ordinance is intended to put an end to this untenable situation,
to close any real or perceived loopholes, and to avoid future abuses of the
County's campaign finance laws by the very people these laws were intended to
constrain.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Chapter 2, Article VII, Sections 2-561, 2-585 and 2-601 of
