and replaced pursuant to Section of the Illinois School Code and that her contract be terminated
pursuant to Section of the Board?s Uniform Principal's Performance Contract.

August 24. 2011


l. Legal Framework

The Illinois School Code grants the Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Public Schools the
authority to place schools on probation to correct deficiencies in their academic performance (105 ILCS
5/3483). The Illinois School Code further grants the Chicago Board of Education ("Board?) the authority
to establish guidelines to determine the factors for placing an attendance center on probation 105 ILCS


Pursuant to that authority. the Board has in place policies under which Doolittle East was placed on
probation. The Board recently adopted the "School Performance. Remediation and Probation Policy for
the 2010-2011 School Year." (Board Report 10-0728-PO3) and Doolittle East will remain on Probation in
accord with the terms of that policy.

The School Code provides that when a school on probation fails to make adequate progress to correct
deficiencies within one year. the CEO. with the approval of the Board and after an opportunity for a
hearing. may remove and replace the school?s principal. 105 ILCS 5134-8 Pursuant to Section 
of the Board?s Uniform Principal's Performance Contract. a principal?s contract may be terminated before
the expiration of its four-year term based upon the principal's removal pursuant to Section 34-8 Std)

presided over the Doolittle East principal removal hearing on Thursday. August 4. 2011. in an 
and impartial manner.

The Law Department. representing the CEO. presented the statements of the Area 15 Chief Area Officer
and the Manager of Performance Policy for the Chicago Public Schools as well as dOCumentation to
support a recommendation to remove Lori Lennix as Doolittle East's principal to the hearing officer The
hearing was contested.

The hearing officer has submitted a written report to the CEO summarizing all relevant evidence offered
during the hearing. making ?ndings of fact. and advised the CEO that Sufficient evidence exists to support
the removal of Lori Lennix as the principal of Doolittle East.

Ill. Chief Executive Officer?s Recommendation

The CEO has reviewed the Hearing Officer's report and hereby recommends that Lori Lennix be removed
and replaced as the principal of Doolittle East effective on August 31. 2011. The CEO further
recommends that Lori Lennix's Uniform Principal?s Performance Contract, with a term beginning October
23. 2009. and ending October 22. 2013. These recommendations are based upon the following factors

A. Doolittle East has a history of poor performance. Doolittle East has been on probation for the
past seven (7) consecutive school years, including the 2010-2011 school year. Ms Lennix has
served as principal at Doolittle East for the past 14 school years.

8. Doolittle East's 2010-2011 performance on the ISAT Composite. which is the combined result of
the ISAT reading. mathematics. and science assessments. was 49%. compared to a District
average of 75.6%. In reading. the percentage of Doolittle East students meeting or exceeding
state standards was 47.6%. compared to a District average of 72.8%. In mathematics Doolittle
East's performance was 53%. compared to a District average of 79.5%. In science Doolittle
East's performance was 41%. compared to a District average of 72.4%.

C. The gap between Doolittle East and the District has been persistent over time. and in recent
years has been widening. Since the 2005-2006 school year. Doolittle East's performance on the
Composite increased 9.4 percentage points. from 39.6% to 49%. while the District average
increased 13.8 percentage points. from 61.8% to 75.6%.

D. The performance gap between Doolittle East and the District is consistent across subjects In
reading. the percentage of students meeting or exceeding at Doolittle East increased from 43.5%
in 2005-2006 to 47.6% in 2010?2011. an increase of 4.1 percentage points. Over that same time
period. the District average increased from 59.1% to 72.8%. an increase of 13.7 percentage
points.

E. Mathematics is the one subject in which Doolittle East has narrowed the gap between it
and the District average. Between the 2005-2006 school year and the 2010-2011 school year.
Doolittle East?s math score increased from 36.5% to 53%. an increase of 16.5 percentage points.
Over that same time period. the District average increased from 64% to 795%. an increase of
15.5 percentage points.

13

August 24, 2011

F. In science, the percentage of students meeting or exceeding at Doolittle East increased from
36.8% in 2005-2006 to 41% in 2010-2011, an increase of 4 2 percentage pomts Over that same
time period, the District average increased from 63 3% to 724%. an increase of 9 1 percentage
points.

G. In addition to standardized test scores. the CPS Performance Policy evaluates schools on
attendance rate. The attendance rate for Doolittle East has been consistently lower than the
District average. Between the 2001-2002 school year and the 2010-2011 school year, Doolittle
East's attendance rate has not been above 92%, and in 2010-2011 was 91.4%. Over that time
period. the District average for elementary schools has been consistently at or above 94%. and
was 94.8% in 2010-2011. Doolittle East's 2010-2011 attendance rate of 91 4% was lower than all
but 10% of elementary schools in the District.

H. Doolittle East is on probation in accordance with state law and the CPS Performance Policy The
school has low performance. this performance is consistently low across subject areas. and the
school is not making significant progress in catching up to the District

If the Board adopts the CEO's recommendation to remove the Doolittle East principal. the following
actions will occur;

1. The CEO will appoint an interim principal for Doolittle East. based upon the recommendations of
the Chief Education Officer. The interim principal will serve at the pleasure of the CEO, and

2. The LSC shall have no authority to select a new four-year contract principal until Doolittle East
makes sufficient academic progress to be removed from probation.

FINANCIAL: The interim principal position will be filled at a cost wrthin current budget appropriations
PERSONNEL IMPLICATIONS: An Interim Principal will be selected. who will serve at the pleasure of the

CEO. Until the school cemes off probation. the Local School Council of Doolittle East will have no
authority to select a new four-year contract principal. as required by Board Policy

CONSIDERATION OF FACTORS IN THE SELECTION PROCESS: The
District's magnet and selective enrollment admissions processes consider socio-economic status 
factors that relate to the census tract in which an applicant resides at the time of application
Parents/guardians are responsible for providing a true and correct address on all applications and
updating their current address with the Chicago Public Schools on a timely basis. The application address
will update a student?s address with the system of record (IMPACT), CPS utilizes data in the following six
areas to calculate SES scores and designate an 858 tier for each census tract: (1) median family
income. (2) adult educational attainment. (3) the percentage of single-parent households. (4) the
percentage at home ownership. (5) the percentage of the population that speaks a language other than
English; and (6) a school performance variable. Results from these six SES factors will be combined to
create a composite census tract score for each census tract in Chicago.

The first five SES factors are derived from data gleaned from the S. Census Bureau and other updated
sources of reliable and relevant information. Although the US. Census is administered every 10 years.
current estimates of data tracked by the census are made available through updates published by the
US. Census Bureau and through reliable commercial demographic marketing firms that use a variety of
supplemental data scurces. These data are widely used in retail. health care. telecommunications. real
estate. and economic development industries. among others. The sixth factor. the school performance
variable. is calculated annually from ISAT scores for attendance area schools in each census tract, The
SES tier assignment for each census tract is published on the Office of Academic Enhancements website

$50,000 or 10% of the original contract amount, whichever is less. or. as provided under Section 7-5 of
the Rules. are necessitated by an unforeseen combination of circumstances or conditions calling for
immediate action to protect Board property or to prevent interference with school sessions.

Note on Appendix that a project is listed for Board approval with a cumulative change order rate of
52%. which is 3% over the maximum allowable change order rate (Clemente 2010-51091-PLS). This
work was authorized by CIP and completed in July 2011 based on an incorrect calculation of the
cumulative change order rate at 46.23%. This rate was calculated based on the total project complete
cost (construction. architects. engineers. environmental consultants) rather than on the construction cost
of the project. This error in the calculation methodology within the database has been fixed so future
errors will not occur.
