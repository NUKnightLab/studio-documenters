STATEMENT FROM COOK COUNTY BOARD PRESIDENT JOHN H. STROGER, JR.
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 17, 2003 from
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
The process of building a new hospital began ten years ago. It entailed hundreds of pages of
documentation to get the Certificate of Need (CON) from the State of Illinois.
As early as 1994, in the CON documentation, it was anticipated that the main hospital structure would be
demolished. Furthermore, the demolition of the children's hospital and the power plant was always part of
the plan to make way for Phase Two of the parking structure. This has long been the plan and for Board
Members to claim that they were unaware of these plans suggests they have not done their homework.
This project was not planned in a vacuum. There were any number of County, City and State agencies
involved.
A 1998 letter from then Commissioner Christopher Hill of the City's Planning Department, laid out very
clearly the conditions upon which the City would issue the final building permits. The Jetter specifically
states, "The City agreed to issue the Superstru.cture Pem1it approval with the understanding that the
County will approve the demolition of the existing hospital and develop a park in its place". The letter
further states, "The commitment to demolish the existing building will be necessary before the City will
issue the final building permit for the new hospital...".
Additionally, we have been granted interim zoning relief for the period after completion of the new
hospital up until the demolition of the old structures as we are in violation of the site coverage
requirement.
Planned developments are just that, planned. These have been the plans for years based on agreements
and commitments we have made. At this point, I have not been told that these agreements can be
dismissed or even overlooked. These are legal matters that I have asked State's Attorney Devine to
review.
That being said, the recent media attention placed on the concept of preserving the building has not
yielded a single development plan which sufficiently addresses the site coverage requirement and finds a
suitable use of the property which is consistent with the statutes guiding development in the Illinois
Medical District.
If a cooperative proposal came forward that satisfied the needs of the Illinois Medical District and
addressed the City of Chicago requirements, I would be open to reviewing it. But understand that I will
not compromise the construction of Phase Two of the parking garage.

I appreciate, as much as anybody, the rich history of Cook County Hospital. But as the Chief Executive
of this County, it is my job to carry out the commitments made to develop the hospital campus within the
rules and regulations as agreed upon.

LETTERS
December 9, 1998
John H. Stroger
President
Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 North Clark Street
Suite 537
Chicago, Illinois 60602
Dear President Stroger:
As you are aware, the Department of Planning and Development has approved the
issuance of several pennits for the construction of the new Cook County Hospital. The
Site Plan and Foundation Permit was approved on May 29, 1998, and the Superstructure
Pennit was approved on September 2, 1998.
A specific condition to the Superstructure Permit approval, as evidenced in the attached
letter to Paul Woznicki, Zoning Administrator for the City, was the issue of interim
zoning relief for the period after completion of construction of the new hospital but prior
to demolition of the old hospital. During this interim period, the county will be in
violation of the zoning allowed in the Medical District and on this site (the allowable
coverage ratio for this site is 40%, but with both buildings in place, the coverage ratio
will be 40%). The Illinois Medical District, the administrator of PD #3 0, agreed to the
current county hospital site plan with the understanding that the site of the existing
hospital will become a park, causing the final site coverage ratio (with the new hospital)
to be below 40%.
The City agreed to issue the Superstructure Permit approval with the understanding that
the County will approve the demolition of the existing hospital and develop a park in its
place. The City respectfully requests that the County Board take this action as soon as
possible. The commitment to demolish the existing building will be necessary before the
City will issue the final building pennit for the new hospital, which we understand will be
submitted just after the first of the year, 1999.
Christopher R. Hill

Re:

Issuance of a "Superstructure Pem1it" for Institutional Planned
Development No. 30, as Amended, Sub-Area 2A
Proposal: The construction of the new Cook County Hospital
Location: The southeast comer of Darnen Avenue and Polk Street

1704

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2003

Dear Mr. Woznicki:
We have received an Interim Stage Part II submittal for the construction of the shell and
core for an eight story new Cook County Hospital building, at the southeast comer of
Darnen A venue and Polk Street in Sub-Area 2A of Planned Development No. 30. These
plans, prepared by CCH Design Group, are dated June 15, 1998.
The Department of Planning and Development has previously issued Site Plan approval
(May 29, 1998) and Foundation Permit approval (also May 29, 1998) for the proposed
construction. The current submittal for a "Superstructure Permit" would consist of work
on the core and shell, i.e., the superstructure, deck, building cores and exterior enclosure.
The superstructure permit would specifically exclude tenant "fit-up" work, including but
not limited to interior electrical, plumbing, and mechanical work, partitions, elevators or
other equipment, and interior finishes. Such work would need to be authorized by final
Part II and building permit approvals.
Please not the status of two issues referred to in the Site Plan approval letter by
Commissioner Hill. Regarding parking, traffic management and traffic improvement:
Tom Kaeser from COOT and George Davis from the Illinois Medical District (IMO)
have confirmed that the City and County have reached an agreement on these issues. The
second issue concerns interim zoning relief for the period after construction of the new
hospital but prior to demolition of the old hospital and to completion of phase 2 of the
parking garage. Per the Applicant, we understand that future plans for the existing
hospital are still being studied. Although we agree to allow the project to proceed while
this study continues, the issue must be resolved before we will issue our final Part II
approval for the building. During this interim period described above, the percentage of
land covered will temporarily exceed the maximum pem1itted for Sub-Area 2A of the
Planned Development and the amount of parking will fall short of the required level. We
will appreciate the Applicant's cooperation in resolving this issue as soon as possible.
Subject to the aforementioned caveats pertaining to future approvals, the Department
hereby approves the Superstructure Permit submissions for the new Cook County
Hospital. Upon completion of our review of a full Part II submittal, and resolution of the
outstanding issues, we will inform your Department. In no way does this letter absolve
the Applicant from obtaining a full Part 11 approval or other approvals as required by
Chicago City Code.

RESOLUTION

THE HONORABLE JOHN H. STROGER, JR., PRESIDENT, JERRY BUTLER,
ALLAN C. CARR AND JOHN P. DALEY, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, on June 22, 1994, this Honorable Body approved Resolution 94-R-252,
supporting the proposed plan to construct a new Cook County Hospital as a replacement
for the faci lity located at 1835 West Harrison Street (the "Existing Hospital") and
identifying a source of funding for design and construction; and

1705

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2003

WHEREAS, the age and obsolescence of the Existing Hospital were major factors in
establishing the need for the New Cook County Hospital; and

WHEREAS, construction of the New Cook County Hospital began in Spring 1998 and
the estimated completion date is Spring 2002; and

WHEREAS, upon completion of the New Cook County Hospital, all operations currently
located in the Existing Hospital will be relocated to the New Cook County Hospital, and
the Existing Hospital will be excess property, of no further use as a medical facility; and

WHEREAS, due to the age and obsolescence of the Existing Hospital and the Power
Plant and the specialized nature of the structures, conversion of the Existing Hospital or
Power Plant to another use would be very costly; and

WHEREAS, a non-medical use for the Existing Hospital would not fit the character of
the Medical District; and

WHEREAS, the site of the Existing Hospital and the New Cook County Hospital (the
" Site") falls within City of C hicago Planned Development No. 30, which is adm inistered
by the Illinois Medical District; and

WHEREAS, the Medical District Master Plan allows for a site coverage of 40% for the
Site, and such Master Plan further delineates the site of the Existing Hospital as open
space or park space; and

WHEREAS, upon completion of the New Cook County Hospital, the ratio of the
building area of County facilities, including the Existing Hospital and Power Plant, to the
area of the site will be 45% thus exceeding the allowable ratio of 40%; and

WHEREAS, the City of Chicago has agreed to issue initial permits, including a
"Superstructure Permit" to allow the construction to proceed and has agreed to interim
zoning relief to allow such excess site coverage for a period of time after completion of
the New Cook County Hospital to allow for demolition of the Existing Hospital; and

WHEREAS, the City of Chicago has expressly conditioned such permits upon the
prompt resolution of the Board of Commissioners of the disposition of the Existing
Hospital, and final permits will not be issued until this issue is decided; and

WHEREAS, the appropriate County departments have been in consultation with the
Illinois Historic Preservation Agency with regard to the possible demolition of certain
structures on the Cook County Hospital Campus; and

1706

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2003

WHEREAS, the County will comply with parameters established in the Illinois Historic
American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record Standards and
Guidelines for documenting buildings to be demolished.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the following actions be hereby
approved and authorized in order to save the County the extremely high cost of
renovation and reuse of the Existing Hospital and Power Plant, and the order to satisfy the
City of Chicago zoning requirement that the site coverage be reduced to no more than
40%: the appropriate County departments commence planning for the eventual
demolition of the Existing Hospital; that the appropriate County departments provide for
an appropriate means of documenting and preserving a record of the Existing Hospital;
that the retention of consultants, at the appropriate times, to assist in such historic
documentation and in planning for demolition and design is hereby authorized.
Approved and adopted this 6th day of April 1999.
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President
Cook County Board of Commissioners
Attest: DAYID ORR, County Clerk

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered . The motion carried unanimously.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the decision to demolish Cook County Hospital was made in 1999 based on a 1988 study
and a limited examination of space alternatives to meet zoning requirements; and
WHEREAS, that decision was based primarily on a 1988 study that focused on the rehabilitation and
reuse of the structure for the purposes of a hospital or for educational and offices uses for the hospital;
and
WHEREAS, in 1988 there was not a significant track record of redevelopment of buildings of this size,
and since that time, great strides have been made in the rehabilitation/reuse of large historic structures,
such as Medinah Temple, the Reliance Building, the Montgomery Ward Warehouse, Chicago's Theatre
District, and the Milwaukee County Hospital; and
WHEREAS, federal and local tax credits and incentives of more than $20 million are in place now that
did not exist when the study was done, drastically improving the economic feasibility of such a project
that can have mixed uses, including medical offices, clinic space, medical conference space, retail for
medical staff and the community and residential units; and

1714

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2003

WHEREAS, Cook County Hospital is significant both as one of the city's best examples of Beaux Artsstyle architecture and for its national historic significance treating the indigent and developing innovative
treatments for such things as bums and sickle cell anemia; and
WHEREAS, every new citizen group of Cook County was treated with dignity and medical expertise at
Cook County Hospital from 1914 to 2003 ; and
WHEREAS, in part because of its architectural and historic significance, Cook County Hospital was
chosen to be the model for the television series "ER'', and the fac;ade of the hospital has since become a
symbol of Chicago recognized around the world; and
WHEREAS, in addition to historic and architectural benefits, preservation of such structures serves as an
economic catalyst to the area; and
WHEREAS, redeveloping the main hospital site excluding the Children's Hospital, power plant, 12KV
Building and other additions would put the two-block-long property on the tax rolls and meet all required
zoning; and
WHEREAS, much of the "demolition preparation contract" (approved 8/ 1/02) focused on planning
efforts, including building documentation, utility relocation plans, and asbestos and other environmental
removal, initiatives that would have to be done regardless of whether the building is demolished or
reused; and
WHEREAS, a contract for the actual demolition has not been proposed, reviewed or approved; and
WHEREAS, actual demolition will cost the County from $20-$30 million and the actual tax credits a
developer could pay the County are in excess of $20 million, in addition to future real estate tax revenues;
and
WHEREAS, demolition and creation of another passive park, similar to Pasteur Park will have no direct
community benefits; and
WHEREAS, a reuse of the building has many direct community benefits; and
WHEREAS, although the discussion to consider demolislunent of the hospital goes back as far as 1988,
the demolition or preservation of the structure will be a major decision of this Board of Commissioners,
many of whom have little to no information about the project.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County hold a hearing to discuss the demolition or reuse of the hospital and to consider the cost savings
that cou ld result from the main hospital bui lding' s reuse, in whole or in part without any financial
contribution from the County of Cook, prior to proceeding with a demolition contract.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
referred to the Committee on Construction (Comm. No. 259882) and the Committee on Health and

The Honorable,
The Board of Commissioners of Cook County

ATTENDANCE
Present:

Chairman Daley, Vice-Chairman Steele, Commissioners Butler, Claypool, Collins,
Gorman, Goslin, Hansen, Maldonado, Moreno, Murphy, Peraica, Quigley, Sims,
Suffredin and President Stroger (16)

Absent:

Commissioner Silvestri (I)

Also Present:

Grace Colbert - Director, Department of Budget and Management Services; Thomas
J. Glaser - Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance; and John F. Chambers,
County Comptroller

Court Reporter:

Anthony W. Lisanti, C.S.R.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, June 10, 2003 at the hour of I 0:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois, to consider the transfer of funds between accounts, as requested by
various departments of county government.
Sandra K. Williams, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners, announced two pages have been
distributed which should be added to the respective volumes, as follows: page 94A (Department 312 Forensic Clinical Services) shou ld be inserted in Volume One; and page 761A (Department 130 Recorder of Deeds) should be inserted in Volume Two.
Chainnan Daley announced that he submitted a list of ten questions to all departments and agencies
requesting approval for a transfer of funds. Their responses are included in the appropriate sections of
Volume One and Volume Two. Chairman Daley further stated that prior to a transfer being approved by
the Budget Department, the departments and agencies had to comply in responding to the ten questions.
Chairman Daley noted for the members an agenda has been distributed which outlines the order of
consideration of the transfer of funds.
At the request of Chaimrnn Daley, Grace Colbert, Director, Department of Budget and Management
Services, gave an overview of the transfer of funds. Ms. Colbert explained that each volume includes a
table of contents. Additionally, Volume One includes transfer requests under $25,000 from those over
$25,000, as well as, an overview of the last six years of transfers. She fu1ther commented that this year' s
transfers represent a 1.3% change in line items from what was originally approved and adopted in the
budget. She explained that prior to the past ten years, transfer meetings were held at numerous times
throughout the year. She further commented that the County Board monitors the transfer process much
more closely than required by statute; the statute requires that the County Board approve transfers only
across object classifications, whereas the County Board approves transfers within, as well as across,
object classifications. Ms. Colbert concluded by explaining that when a position is vacant it does not
necessarily mean that it is available to be filled, because the budget only funds 97% of the total dollars
needed to fill all positions. Therefore every department head and elected official is required to fill no
more than 97% of their positions at any given time.

1778

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2003

Commissioner Quigley remarked that it appears that there is a recurring trend that the same positions are
vacant every year, the same funds are transferred every year, and overtime is transferred into the same
accounts every year. He asked why these funds couldn't be integrated outright into the budget for the
subsequent year.
Ms. Colbert replied that these trends relate to the manpower accounts, and that it is not advisable to fund a
vacant position and fund overtime simultaneously, because this would result in duplication and inflation
of the budget. For example, in those areas where it is difficult to recruit, such as nursing, the requisite
number of jobs need to be funded in order to continue to recruit for them. Should the position not be
filled, some of the vacancy money needs to be transferred to cover the overtime.
Commissioner Quigley commented that regarding positions where the likelihood is high that the position
will not be filled, the budgetary process would be more transparent if it allowed for more realistic
overtime appropriations. He further commented that perhaps the category of overtime work should be
adjusted, for example, perhaps overtime should not be awarded to a person who works weekends yet only
works 40 hours, and perhaps compensatory time should be awarded instead of overtime in certain
situations.
Ms. Colbert replied that even by private industry standards, a 1.3% transfer rate is outstanding. She
explained that she did not want to unnecessarily inflate the budget, and that in terms of transparency, the
budget book reflects historical spending. She also explained that a position cannot be recruited for if
there are no funds with which to recruit.
Vice-Chairman Steele asked whether it is difficult to estimate how much overtime will be needed, and
whether therefore it is better to transfer the exact funds from the vacant position.
Ms. Colbert replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Suffredin commented that in the Illinois state government, transferring funds between
personnel and operational funds is restricted. He asked whether this is being considered for the county
budget.
Ms. Colbert replied in the negative, noting that such transfers do, however, require board approval.
Commissioner Suffredin asked whether industrial engineers are involved in analyzing overtime transfers.
Ms. Colbert replied that industrial engineers are involved with the budget and with overtime issues.
Commissioner Hansen commented that the transfers before the board are significantly under 2%, whereas
the average corporation allows 5%. Also, he stated that because personnel accounts for 75% of all
expenditures, it would be prudent to examine the overtime situation.
Commissioner Claypool asked what the vacancy allowance is for the budget and whether it varies by
department.
Ms. Colbert replied that the rate is 3% for any department that has a budget over $1.5 million.
The Committee considered requests from various departments to transfer appropriations between
budgetary accounts. Chairman Daley proceeded to the requests for transfers of funds under $25,000.
They are as follows:

Also Present:

Michael L. LaMont - Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy; Zelda Whittler Undersheriff; Superintendent Holmes - Division XI; and Michael Henson - Phillip
Swager Associates

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Tuesday, June I 0, 2003 at the hour of 11 :30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
259626

OFFICE OF CAP ITAL PLANNING AND POLICY by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated May 12, 2003:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a
professional services contract with PHILLIPS SWAGER ASSOCIATES, for
architectural/engineering services for the Department of Corrections, Division Xl Security
Renovation Project. lt is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this
request.

1842

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2003

This project provides for renovation of the existing security system to replace the current,
outdated system. The work includes replacement of all Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLC), touch screens, computers and associated software, replacement of existing intercom
system and replacement of the existing CCTV system in order to support the operational
requirements of the facility.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $297,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 6/3/03.
Commissioner Hansen asked when the current CCTV system was installed in Division XI.
Michael LaMont responded that the current system was installed in 1993. He stated that the new security
system technology is six or seven generations beyond the technology of the existing system. He said that
a generation is eighteen months to two years and noted that the existing security system installed in
Divis ion XI is a DOS-based system, which is outdated and parts are not available.
Chairman Sims stated that current technology is growing fast and anything purchased today becomes
outdated quickly.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the color monitors, Zelda Whittler of the
Sheriff's Office stated that Division XI is a keyless division and monitors are used in order to scan
throughout the facility. She stated that color resolution monitors allow for a more clear picture. As the
officers are looking at strategically placed cameras they can clearly see the individuals who have
requested access to certain areas. Ms. Whittler further stated that the Sheriff's Office has learned that a
custom system has limitations. She said the Sheriff's Office and the Office of Capita l Planning and
Policy are working on installing a new system where there can be certain parts that would be available
through other vendors, which does not exist with the custom system.
Commissioner Hansen asked who was responsible for the initial television system.
Zelda Whittler stated that she couldn't respond to this question at this time.
Chai rman Sims asked Zelda Whittler to respond by letter to Commi ssioner Hansen's question.
Michael LaMont stated that the prime contractor on the original project was Knight/Roula . Mr. LaMont
further explained what the Undersheriff meant by "out-of-date. " He noted that the system specifications
were done prior to 1993.
Commissioner Moreno stated that add-ons and upgrades should be built into future specifications for this
equipment.
Chairman Sims stated that the county should look at projects that allow easy upgrades and add-ons
throughout the entire county system.
Commi ssioner Hansen asked why the Sheriff's Office requested color monitors and not black and white,
and why were fifty to sixty new cameras necessary.

1843

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2003

Zelda Whittler stated that an assessment was made of the facility and it was detenllined that the cameras
did not cover certain areas. Ms. Whittler noted that the high-resolution color allows the officers to have a
clearer picture.

In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question regarding Biometric devices, Michael LaMont stated that
generally a Biometric device involves an eye scanner, fingerprint scan, or other sca1ming device.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the advantage of using biometric devices.
Michael Henson of Phillip Swager Associates, stated that the advantage of having a biometric reader is
that it reads some kind of physical characteristic and makes it difficult to pass a card or a pin number. He
stated that this technology and application were identified and developed through the design process.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the fire alarm system and interlocking,
Michael LaMont stated that the security system and the fire alarm in each building are currently
interlocked. The request includes making certain that the security system is interlocked to the fire alarm
system that is currently installed.

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the impact of the upgrade on other Depa1tment
of Corrections buildings, Michael Henson stated that the idea is to have a robust design that is nonproprietary and easily supportable.
Commissioner Butler asked what is the estimated cost once the design is completed.
Michael LaMont stated that the estimate is $2.6 million, but the cost will be continually reviewed through
the design process.
259627

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated May 12, 2003:

1844

OLD BUSINESS
Commissioner Hansen reiterated his concern about the blinds and windows in Stroger Hospital of Cook
County.
Michael LaMont stated that he would provide a written response for Commissioner Hansen.

MAY 9, 2003 PROJECT REPORT
Commissioner Hansen asked the status of the upgrade and renovation of the mechanical systems at
Provident Hospital of Cook County.
Michael LaMont commented that in the course of obtaining permits for the project from the City of
Chicago and the Illinois Department of Public Health, there were a number of additional items that had to
be put into the project, which are being evaluated. The prime contractor also had to replace the
mechanical sub-contractor. The Office of Capital Planning and Policy is now looking at how to have the
work completed, but it will not be completed this spring.
Commissioner Hansen asked how much the additions will cost as requested by the City of Chicago.
Michael LaMont responded that it is in the range of $300,000 to $400,000.
In respo nse to Commissioner Hansen ' s question regarding the structured wmng system at Stroger
Hospital of Cook County, Michael LaMont stated that the work is complete except for the punch list. At
this time the Office of Capital Planning and Policy is trying to close out the project with the contractor,
but is having difficulty because the contractor has submitted sixteen different change orders, which are
now being evaluated.

1846

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2003

In response to Commissioner Hansen 's question regarding Stroger Hospital of Cook County' s medical
equipment package, Michael LaMont stated that this is a contract that was executed with Siemens
Medical Solutions. Mr. LaMont stated that when Siemens submitted their bid for medical ventilators the
consultant reviewed it and determined they met specifications and awarded the contract. When the
ventilators were delivered, it turned out that there were design features that the ventilators did not meet.
In conclusion, Mr. LaMont stated that Siemens will accept the ventilators but the company wants the
county to pay shipping and recertification costs, which is approximately $350,000. At this time the
hospital is using the ventilators from the old hospital.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the status and detai l on the project at the

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2003

Commissioner Gorman asked how real estate items come before the board.
Wally Kos, Superintendent of Highways, stated that County Ordinance 95-0-7 stipulates that when the
appraised real estate value is in excess of fifty thousand dollars, the Highway Department must seek
County Board approval prior to acquisition of said property.
Jn response to Commissioner Butler' s question, Chairman Steele asked Superintendent Kos to give an
overview of the two items.

Superintendent Kos stated the first parcel in Communication 259397 is located in the Village of Hazel
Crest where the proposed improvement is to increase the clearance along 171 st Street and dip down along
Park Avenue. Mr. Kos stated that another option is for the county to either build a retaining wall, which
would limit available space devoted to Park Avenue, or close Park Avenue and restrict it to a right in or
right out. He commented that the Village of Hazel Crest does not want Park Avenue to be restricted
because the Village has a TIP district in the area and in order to keep Park Avenue open, the county must
level and re-grade the street and the parcel is part of the improvement.
Mr. Kos commented that the Village of East Hazel Crest purchased the property in anticipation of County
Board approval. The Highway Department then purchased the parcel from the Village to complete the
project. Further, Mr. Kos stated the parcel on Volmer Road involves a church which has a detention
basin and parking spaces right up against the proposed right-away line. He said Volmer Road is slated to
go from two lanes to five lanes, and the county needs fifty feet of the church property in addition to
easements for the relocation of approximately forty parking spaces. Mr. Kos noted the Highway
Department negotiated for six months with various departments, the Village of Matteson and church
representatives for the 171st Street parcel and the parcel on Volmer Road, and the Department has
reached a settlement subject to County Board approval.
Commissioner Peraica asked if the property is being taken away from owners pursuant to imminent
domain powers, and expressed his concern that the fair market value of the parcels be considered. The
commissioner further inquired about appraisals, land studies and acquisition costs.
ln response to Commissioner Peraica 's comments, Mr. Kos noted that the commissioner's concerns were
addressed and stated the acquisition cost for the parcel at 17 l st Street is $173,566.32 and the Volmer
Road cost is $244, I 00.00.
Chairman Steele asked about environmental issues regarding these parcels.
Mr. Kos responded that there are no environmental issues. He stated that when the buildings are
demolished, some special care should be taken in the event asbestos tiles are discovered, and if this is the
case, the Highway Department would call for a special use waste disposal.
Commissioner Peraica asked if environmental studies were conducted by the Highway Department?
Mr. Kos responded that there were no environmental studies done on the parcels by the Highway
Department. He stated the site is a totally occupied structure that has been there for one hundred years.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved the approval of Communication
Nos. 259397 and 259398. The motion carried.
