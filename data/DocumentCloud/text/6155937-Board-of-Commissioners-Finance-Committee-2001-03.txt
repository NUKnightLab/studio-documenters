COUNTY TREASURER, Maria Pappas, transmitting a Communication, dated
August 2, 1999:
In a letter dated July 2, 1999, I informed you that a RFP was being issued to
replace our cashiering system since the system is not Y2K compliant. The
letter explained the urgency in selecting a vendor in time for consideration at
the August 4, 1999 Board meeting. This urgency results from the extremely
tight timeframe to plan, install and test the new cashiering system by a
December 1, 1999 implementation deadline.
RFP's were sent to vendors based on the recommendations of Ernst & Young
LLP.
Proposals were received and evaluated for three vendors, USL
Financials, CPS Systems, Inc. and System Innovators Incorporated. The
proposals were evaluated for: (1) the capabilities of the software application in
meeting the cashiering requirements of the Treasurer's Office; (2) the cost; (3)
the implementation schedule; and (4) the fit with the long-term information
technology strategies of the Treasurer's Office including an enterprise resource
planning system that will improve financial control.
As a result of the above process, I am requesting authorization for the
Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with USL FINANCIALS for the lease
purchase of a cashiering system. The cost of the system for a five year capital
lease is $2, 183, 119.85 including software, hardware and training as detailed in
the proposal submitted. The first year capital lease cost of $436,623.97 will be
paid from the 717/060-579 appropriation account, and the annual maintenance
cost of $171 ,350.00 will be paid from the 060-440 account. The proposal
includes MBE/WBE participation at 38% of the non-proprietary hardware cost.
I appreciate your support of this necessary request, in order to continue our
efforts to modernize this office and increase its efficiency.

*Referred to the Finance Committee August 4, 1999.
With respect to Item 230130, the Cashiering component was approved as
amended at the August 10, 1999 Finance Committee meeting.
