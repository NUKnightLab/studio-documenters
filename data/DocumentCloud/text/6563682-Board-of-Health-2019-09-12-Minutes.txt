H. Health Commissioner's Report
1. Reaccreditation. Ms. Skoda reported no deficiencies. Ms. Skoda recommendedgiving the staffan
additional day offas appreciation for reaccreditation.
Motion by Mr. Karant, secondedby Mr.Cugini, granting staff Monday, December23, 2019
as a paid dayoff in recognition oftheir hard work in achieving national reaccreditation.
Approvedby voice vote.
2. Storm Waterand Sanitary Sewer Bid Update/DLZ Ohio, Inc. Contract Amendment. Ms.
Skoda reported one bid received in excess of the 25% to 30% of the engineer's estimates. Due to
excessive spring rain, it was a tough yearfor construction. Our timeline was very tight. We want
the sewer project done immediately. Storm watercould technically wait until spring. That caused
us to increase DLZ contract to project manageinto the spring andalso dueto the split bid. Wewill
rebid the projectfor a better pull ofcandidatesas well as cheaper cost comparisons. Weaskedfor
itemization in the new bid tocompareapples or oranges.
