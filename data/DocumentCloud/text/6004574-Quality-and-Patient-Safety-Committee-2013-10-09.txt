Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation
A. Update on Culture of Safety Survey Results (Attachment #1)
Dr. Krishna Das, System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation, provided an
overview of the information presented regarding the Culture of Safety Survey results.
The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Lerner thanked Dr. Das and the staff for the exceptional reports that have been provided to the
Committee. He noted that the strategic issue is really the issue of the culture - not a culture focusing on safety,
but a culture focusing on trust. This needs to be embedded in an overall human resource plan that deals with the
interaction between front-line managers and supervisors and their direct staff, because the supervisors are seen
as the representatives of management. He inquired whether there is a human resource policy or effort underway
that will encapsulate this element. Dr. Das responded that there does need to be a human resources policy
addressing this; that subject has been under discussion, and will probably take some time to build because the
System has a very established infrastructure. Director Lerner stated that he hopes to receive a report sometime
in the future that reflects the three parties involved – front-line managers and supervisors, direct staff, and labor
– and how they are working towards the effort of a culture focusing on trust.

During the review of the information, Director Muñoz inquired regarding emergency planning. Dr. Murray
stated that emergency planning is a big, relatively well-funded area. County government has a structure headed
by Michael Masters, with whom CCDPH interacts; with regard to suburban Cook County, one of CCDPH’s
tasks is to work with the nearly two hundred fifty (250) villages and towns and coordinate the work. Following
the discussion of the subject, Dr. Murray stated that this Committee can request to look at emergency planning
in more detail; she stated that representatives from the City of Chicago can also be brought in for a more
comprehensive report on the subject.
Director Lerner, seconded by Chairman Collens, moved to receive and file the Annual

 Joint Commission Standard

 



 

Leaders create and maintain a culture of safetv and gualitv throughout the hospital.

Rationale:

Safety.r and gualitv thrive in an environment that supports teamwork and respect for other people. regardless of their position
in the hospital. Leaders demonstrate their commitment to gualitv and set expectations for those who work in the hospital.
Leaders evaluate the culture on a regular basis.

Leaders encourage teamwork and create structures. processes, and programs that allow this positive culture to ?ourish.
Disruptive behavior that intimidates others and affects morale or staff turnover can be harmful to patient care. Leaders must

address disruptive behavior of individuals working at all levels of the hospital. including management. clinical and
administrative staff. licensecl independent practitioners, and governing bodv members.

Elements of Performance:

CCDPH has not been able to implement the
specifics of the 2015 plan. We continue to play a
leading role in NIPC, NACCHO, IPHA, APHA
We successfully transferred DENTAL services to
ACHN (still providing back office support)
“Virtual” TB integration at Oak Forest Campus

•We remain with our original 4 cross disciplinary teams (Access
to Care, CVD, Sexual Health, Violence Prevention) and are
unable to add teams as planned. All teams are making progress
on their work plans.
•CCDPH established its Community Health Advisory Committee
(CHAC) which now has regular meetings.

• We remain a state certified health department meeting all
standards and state inspections and audits. (e.g. CLIA)
•We are on target for national PHAB acrreditation
• The departmental QA committee has been institutionalized
with clear work plans for next year.

4. Strengthening

Overweight and Obesity Prevalence Among SchoolAged Children in Suburban Cook County, Illinois
Introduction
Summary of
Key Findings

1

Overall, the overweight
and obesity rates in SCC
are higher than national
averages.

2

There are significant
differences in obesity
rates between regions.

3

Obesity rates in the west,
south and southwest
regions are higher than
national rates.

Overweight and obesity among children is a major public health concern in suburban
Cook County (SCC), where 40% of 9th graders are already overweight or obese compared
to 32% of 9th graders in the U.S.1
Preventing childhood obesity is important to our children’s health and well-being.
Children and young people who are obese are likely to be obese as adults2 and are at
increased risk of developing serious health problems including heart disease, type 2
diabetes, sleep apnea, depression and liver disease3. Obesity in children can have
negative social and emotional consequences; for example, teasing and bullying4.
Additionally, annual medical costs including prescription drug, emergency room, and
outpatient costs for obese children in the U.S. are estimated to be $14.1 billion per year5.
To determine the extent and distribution of overweight and obesity among school-aged
children in SCC, the Cook County Department of Public Health in collaboration with the
Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s
Hospital of Chicago conducted an assessment. This brief report shares key findings and
recommendations for future efforts.

What was done
Body Mass Index (BMI)i, calculated using height and weight data recorded from student
Certificate of Child Health Examination (CCHE) formsii, was collected from 37,702 students
in 129 SCC public schools during school years 2010-11 and 2011-12. Data were available
for students in kindergarten, 6th and 9th grades.
Children with age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentile scores of 85 to 94iii are categorized as
overweight, and those with scores above 94 are classified as obese. The sampling method
used allowed for generalization of overweight and obesity estimates for public school
students in SCC by age, grade and region in which they attend school.

w  Obesity rates in the west, south and southwest regions of SCC are significantly higher than that of the north and
  northwest regions of SCC.
  •  Obesity rates are generally twice as high in the west region of SCC as compared to the rates in the north.
  •  Compared to the north region of SCC, obesity rates in the south and southwest regions are nearly 75% higher
   for kindergartners; over 80% higher for 6th grade students; and over 25% higher for 9th grade students.

Key Finding

Obesity rates in the west, south and southwest regions of SCC are higher than national rates for
children in similar age groups.
w  In the west region of SCC, the obesity rate for kindergartners is nearly twice the national rate; and is 64% and 58%
  higher, respectively, for 6th and 9th grade students than the national rate.
w  Compared to national rates, obesity rates in the south and southwest regions of SCC are nearly 60% higher for
  kindergartners; over 85% higher for 6th grade students and nearly 25% higher for 9th grade students.

Recommendations
Childhood obesity affects thousands of children in SCC. Prevention is more
cost effective than treatment of obesity. An integral part of the solution to
addressing obesity is one that includes implementing policies and evidencebased programs that create supportive environments that promote healthy
eating and active living.
Additionally, continued monitoring of child overweight and obesity
prevalence in SCC is needed. These data, which are the first obesity prevalence
rates available specifically for SCC, allow for understanding the extent and
distribution of overweight and obesity among school-aged children in SCC. A
system for continued surveillance is necessary to inform resource allocation
decisions and to monitor progress in reducing overweight and obesity among
SCC students.
Definitions
i.  Body Mass Index (BMI) is the relationship of height to weight.
ii.  In Illinois, completed Certificate of Child Health Examination forms (CCHE) forms are required for all public school students by October 15th of their kindergarten, 6th and
  9th school years. The CCHE is completed by parents and an authorized health professional. Parents complete a section on family background and chronic conditions.
  Health care providers provide clinically-measured and diagnosis data including weight and height. Demographics such as age, gender (and as of January 2013,
  race/ethnicity) are also included.
iii.  Sex- and age-adjusted BMI percentile scores are used to determine weight status because children’s growth fluctuates as they age and growth patterns differ by sex and
  age. Age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentile scores indicate how a child compares to others of the same age and sex. For example, a child with a BMI percentile score of 95
  has a BMI greater than 955 of children his same age and sex. Weight status categories are assigned based on percentile scores. BMI percentile scores between 85 and 94
  are categorized as overweight. BMI percentile scores equal to or greater than 95 are categorized as obese.
iv.  When differences are described in this report as “statistically significant” or “significantly higher”, it means that the likelihood of these differences occurring by chance is
  small –less than 5%. In other words, if we repeated this analysis 100 times, we are likely to find differences of similar magnitude at least 95 out of 100 times.

Overweight and obesity among children is a major public health concern in suburban
Cook County (SCC). A recent comparison between national and SCC overweight and
obesity prevalence rates by grade specific age groups found SCC rates to be significantly
higher. For example, 40% of 9th graders in SCC are already overweight or obese compared
to 32% in the U.S. Disparities in overweight and obesity prevalence are also found among
regions within SCC where the West and Southwest regions have significantly higher rates.1
Physical activity (PA), along with proper nutrition, is important in preventing obesity.
In addition, PA has many other benefits for children’s health and development, such as
building and maintaining strong bones and muscles and promoting social and emotional
well-being2.3. It further has been linked to improved academic performance.4
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children engage in at
least one hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily to gain health
benefits. Moderate PA includes activities such as fast walking; whereas vigorous PA
includes activities such as running. Since most U.S. children and youth spend almost half
their waking day in school, providing PA opportunities in school settings has the
potential to impact the health of most school-aged children and youth. If PA were
distributed equally throughout non-sleep hours, we would expect school-aged children
and youth in school to engage in at least 28 minutes or 46% of their daily MVPA during a
typical 6.5 hour school day.
To better understand opportunities for school-based PA interventions that support
obesity prevention, the Cook County Department of Public Health collaborated
with the Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children at Ann and Robert H. Lurie
Children’s Hospital of Chicago to assess school day PA in a sample of 5th and 6th
grade students in selected SCC public elementary schools. This brief shares key findings
and recommendations for future efforts.

What was done
Data on PA during the school day were collected for 1,093 children from two classrooms
(either 5th or 6th grade) in each of 14 SCC public schools during the spring of school years
2010-11 and 2011-12. Participating students wore accelerometers, which measured PA
including time and intensity, for four consecutive school days.

and the Cook County Department of Public
Health (CCDPH).

Accelerometer data were categorized by intensity and time spent in PA by intensity level
over the course of the school day was summarized for each of the four days. In addition,
data were collected on PA opportunities including physical education classes (PE), in-class
PA breaks and recess offered on the days on which accelerometer data were collected.

1

Key Finding
SCC 5th and 6th grade students in the sample did not obtain the expected amount of MVPA
(28 minutes) during the school day.

The types of PA opportunities offered in SCC public schools included in the sample varied and included PE
classes, recess, and in-class PA breaks. All schools in the sample provided some combination of these opportunities, though not all schools provided all types of PA opportunities. On average, 5th and 6th grade students in the
sample had 14 minutes of MVPA during the school day. This is half of the expected school day MVPA.

2

Key Finding
Students in schools with high proportions of minority students had less school day MVPA time.

w  Students in Hispanic majority schools in the sample had less than half the daily MVPA minutes of students in
  schools in the sample with a majority of white students (9.8 vs. 21.2 minutes).
w  Students in Black majority schools in the sample had 67% fewer daily MVPA minutes than students in schools in
  the sample with majority of white students (14.2 vs. 21.2 minutes).

3

Key Finding
Students’ daily average MVPA minutes varied by the combination of PA opportunities offered by
grade and gender.

w  By Grade (for a visual comparison of MVPA minutes by grade, see Chart 1 below)
  •  6th grade students in the sample had the most daily minutes of MVPA (20 minutes) on school days which
   included recess and PE.
  •  5th grade students in the sample had the most daily minutes of MVPA time (27 minutes) on school days
   with a combination of recess, PE and in-class PA breaks PA opportunities.

Recommendations
PA provides numerous health benefits including obesity prevention. PA has also been shown to contribute to academic
achievement even when time for PA decreases instructional time4. Given the benefits of PA and the relatively low proportion of
school day time spent in MVPA among students in the sample, the findings point to the following recommendations.
w  Schools should assess current PA opportunities offered to students and increase the opportunities for students to
  be physically active, especially in schools with high minority enrollment.
w  Schools should use a combination of PA opportunities to support students in reaching daily MVPA expected during the
  school day.
w  PA opportunities and their combination should be tailored by grade and gender. In the sample, differences were seen in
  MVPA achievement by grade and gender based on the combination of PA opportunities offered. To guide the combination
  of PA offerings, schools should consider gathering student input on preferences for PA opportunities.

Assessment of School Meals
in Suburban Cook County, Illinois
Introduction

Summary of
Key Findings

1

Calories in an average
SCC elementary school
lunch exceed USDA
national nutrition
standards.

2

SCC students’ participation
in school meals varied
by meal and school
characteristics.

3

Meal consumption in the
sample of SCC students
varied by meal and item.

Overweight and obesity among children is a major public health concern in suburban
Cook County (SCC). A recent comparison between national and SCC overweight and
obesity prevalence rates by grade specific age groups found SCC rates to be significantly
higher. For example, 40% of 9th graders in SCC were overweight or obese compared to
32% of children in the U.S. Disparities in overweight and obesity prevalence are also found
among regions within SCC where the West and Southwest regions have significantly
higher rates.1
Obesity is caused by long-term patterns of imbalance between calories consumed and
calories burned. Good nutrition, along with physical activity, is important in preventing
obesity. Maintaining a healthy weight includes limiting the number of excess calories
consumed through calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods, including foods high in fat and
sugar.
Public school districts in SCC participate in the National School Breakfast and Lunch
Programs, federally assisted meal programs administered by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA provides subsidies to school districts to support school
meal programs that meet USDA requirements. School districts set meal prices and
are reimbursed by the USDA for meals served. Students from low-income families qualify
for free or reduced price meals.
Most U.S. school children consume school meals. School meal participation rates are
generally higher among elementary school students, minorities and students from lowincome households2. Due to the high levels of student participation, school meals
offer an excellent opportunity to address consumption of excess calories through reduced
availability of high calorie, nutrient-poor foods and increased availability of lower calorie
nutrient-rich foods, such as low-fat milk, whole grains, fruits and vegetables.
To better understand opportunities for school meal interventions that support obesity
prevention, the Cook County Department of Public Health collaborated with the
Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s
Hospital of Chicago to assess school meal content, student participation, likability, and
consumption in a sample of 5th and 6th grade students in 13 SCC public elementary
schools. This brief report shares key findings and recommendations for future efforts.

 Assessment of School Meals
in Suburban Cook County, Illinois

September 2013

What was done
Student school meal participation, likability and consumption data were collected from 1,086 students in two 5th and/or 6th
grade classrooms from each of 13 participating SCC public elementary schools. Using a student school meals questionnaire,
data were collected once in school year 2010-11 and again in 2011-12. Data from the questionnaire were highly correlated
with school meal sales reported by school food service coordinators. Additionally, nutrition information for each lunch meal
served over a one-month period of each school year was collected for each school in the sample.

Key Finding

1

Calories in an average school lunch served at SCC elementary schools in our sample exceeded
USDA national nutrition standards for elementary school lunches3.
w  The average SCC school lunch served at schools in our sample has 692 calories; the current
  national nutrition standard is 550-650 calories for elementary school lunches.

Key Finding
School meal participation in the sample of SCC students varied by meal and school characteristics.

w 
 
 
 
 

Participation in school lunch is significantly higher than for breakfast. In our sample, the participation rate for
school breakfast was 37%, which is the same as the national rate. School lunch participation rates among students
in our sample are higher than of the national average – 85% vs. the national rate of 63%. However, it is known that
elementary school children have higher school meal participation rates.2 Since our sample included only
elementary-aged students, it is likely that student participation rates in SCC are lower.

w 
 
 
 

Similar to national trends, schools with large minority student enrollment in the sample (>70% non-Hispanic Black
or Hispanic) had higher school meal participation rates – 67% for breakfast and 94% for lunch. The higher student
participation rates in these sampled schools increases the likelihood that improvements to school meals in these
settings will have greater impact by reaching more students.

Assessment of School Meals
in Suburban Cook County, Illinois

Key Finding
Meal consumption in the sample of SCC students varied by meal and item.

w  43% of students in our sample reported consuming half or more of breakfast.
w  61% of students in our sample reported consuming half or more of lunch.
w  30% of students in our sample reported eating more than half of vegetables served at either breakfast or lunch –
  the lowest consumption rate for items we tracked.
w  60% of students in our sample reported eating more than half of fruits served at either breakfast or lunch –
  the highest consumption rate for items we tracked.

Recommendations
Schools can play an integral role in improving student health. Because participation is so high, school meals provide a means
to offer lower calorie, nutrient-rich foods to many students. The findings point to three key areas for efforts to improve student
diets though school meals.
Increase Student Participation
Increased participation in school meals is desirable because, generally, while school meal nutritional qualities need
improvement, they offer superior options compared to other available options including lunches brought from home2. For
example, a USDA study found that students participating in school lunch eat twice as many servings of vegetables as those
not participating in school lunch2. Furthermore, students who do not participate in school meals programs are more likely to
purchase competitive foods, which typically are of lower nutritional quality than school meals3. Additionally, in some studies,
participation in school breakfast has been associated with reduced obesity3.
Student participation is also important to ensure the financial stability of the
school meal programs and increase local school districts’ capacity for including
items with higher nutritional quality. The USDA reimburses school districts per
meal served. Economies of scale dictate that larger volumes of meals served can
be cost effective and enable schools to afford to serve higher quality foods.
Therefore, increasing participation can make improving the nutritional quality of
school meals more sustainable at the local level3.
Participation in school breakfast among is much lower than participation in school
lunch, and the amount of the breakfast meal consumed is lower than for lunch
among students in our sample. Consumption of breakfast is important for student
health, academic performance and obesity prevention4. Given this, promotion of school breakfast and working to increase
participation and consumption can have a beneficial impact on the health and wellness of students in SCC.
In schools with high minority populations, a primary challenge may be to increase breakfast participation, as lunch
participation is already very high. Challenges to breakfast participation include logistics such as requiring students to arrive at
school early and increased staffing needs. Some schools have overcome these issues with Universal Breakfast programs
offered to all students in classrooms at the start of the school day.

Reduce Calories in School Meals
Currently, the average school lunch meal served by SCC schools in our sample exceeds the national standard for calories.
Aligning school lunch meals with this standard would assist in efforts to reduce excess calories in the diets of our children.
Suggested nutrition guidelines can be found on the websites of
  w  Alliance for a Healthier Generation at http://www.healthiergeneration.org/schools.aspx
  w  HealthierUS School Challenge at http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/HealthierUS/index.html
Increase Appeal of Healthier Items
In terms of meal item specific improvements, our findings suggest school food service operations should focus on improving
the appeal of vegetables served as they are the meal component least likely to be consumed by students and are typically low
in calories and nutrient dense, making them a good choice for improving dietary quality. Further, the majority of students in
our sample report consuming all or most of fruits served in school meals. This is an area of success, and efforts to maintain this
consumption should continue.

ACRONYMS, ABBREVIATIONS & DEFINITIONS
Active TB: (see TB Disease)
BCG: Bacille Calmette Guérin, a vaccination given to persons, usually infants, in countries where TB is common. BCG is NOT used in the United States.
Extrapulmonary TB: A person with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection outside of the lungs, the pleural
space, and the larynx (voice box). A person with extrapulmonary disease can also have pulmonary TB (see
below).
I-NEDSS: I-NEDSS stands for Illinois-National Electronic Disease Surveillance System. I-NEDSS is a webbased application that establishes a secure and real-time communication link between hospitals, laboratories and
other health care providers with state and local health department staff for the purposes of reporting and managing communicable disease information. All TB cases in suburban Cook County are reported to the Illinois
Department of Public Health using I-NEDSS.
LTBI: Latent Tuberculosis Infection; a person with TB infection who is not contagious.
MDR-TB: Multi-drug resistant TB. MDR-TB is defined as TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, the two most
important first line anti-tuberculosis medications.
Pulmonary TB: A person with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the lungs, pleural space or the larynx
(voice box). A person with pulmonary TB can also have extrapulmonary TB.
QFT-G: QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test, a blood test used to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This test cannot distinguish persons with LTBI from persons with TB disease. In contrast to the TST (see below), QFT-G
can distinguish persons with either LTBI or TB disease from persons who may have received BCG vaccination.
QFT-G has greater specificity than TST.
TB: Tuberculosis
TB Disease: A person with TB infection who is contagious to others; a person with TB disease can have pulmonary TB, extrapulmonary TB, or both.
TST: Tuberculin Skin Test, a test whereby purified protein derivative (PPD) is injected under the skin in the
forearm. Persons with TB infection react to the PPD which results in a bump (induration) where the PPD was
injected. Qualified healthcare personnel can measure the size of the bump and determine whether the test is
positive or negative. A positive TST can indicate active TB infection, LTBI, or prior BCG vaccination. However, the TST is not able to distinguish between these three possibilities.
XDR-TB: Extensively drug resistant TB. XDR-TB is defined as MDR-TB plus TB that is resistant to any fluoroquinoline plus resistance to one of the three injectable drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

OVERVIEW
Epidemiologic Summary
•

Eighty nine (89) new cases of TB were reported in suburban Cook County in 2012. This represents a
rate of 3.6 cases per 100,000 population, a 20% increase in cases reported in 2011 (Table 1).

•

The North District had the highest TB rate (5.9 per 100,000 population) of any of the four public health
districts in suburban Cook County (Table 7).

•

Municipalities with the highest numbers of cases included Des Plaines (n=10) and Skokie (n=8;
Table 7). Each of the following municipalities had four (4) TB cases: Alsip, Glenview, Harvey, Morton
Grove and Niles (Table 7).

TB Burden in Foreign-born Persons
•

The proportion of TB cases in foreign-born persons was 71% in 2012 (Figure 2).

•

Three countries accounted for 62% of all foreign-born cases: India (n=17; 27%), the Philippines (n=12;
19%) and Mexico (n=10, 16%) (Table 3).

•

Among foreign-born persons diagnosed with TB, 71% arrived 5 or more years prior to receiving a
diagnosis of TB disease (Figure 4).

Drug Resistance
•

In 2012, no case of MDR-TB was identified (Table 5).

Coinfection with HIV
•

Five (5) TB cases were coinfected with HIV (Table 6); these persons are defined, per AIDS case definition, as having AIDS.

Directly Observed Therapy
•

In 2012, 98% of patients with pulmonary TB received DOT (Figure 5).

Completion of Therapy
•

For TB cases diagnosed in 2010, the most recent year for which data on completion of tuberculosis
therapy are available, 93% of persons with TB disease who were eligible* completed treatment.

•

Among persons diagnosed in 2010 who were eligible* to complete TB treatment in 12 months*, 83%
of cases did so. This is below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 93% (Figure 6).

* Eligible cases are persons who were alive at the time of TB diagnosis and did not die during therapy, and excludes persons with TB resistant to rifampin and pediatric
cases (<15 years) with a diagnosis of meningeal, bone/joint, or miliary TB.

Cook County Department of Public Health

TECHNICAL NOTES
Surveillance Methodology
Healthcare providers and laboratories in suburban Cook County are required to report the following results within 24 hours: (1)
sputum or tissue smears positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFBs); (2) cultures positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis; (3) mycobacterial drug susceptibility results; (4) any other tests positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, confirmed TB cases must be
reported to CCDPH within 7 days.
TB case reports are entered into I-NEDSS and provide the basis for the information presented in this report. This report includes all
cases of tuberculosis reported during the year in which the case was confirmed. Confirmed TB cases who may have moved into suburban Cook County from another jurisdiction are not reflected in the data presented herein; such cases are counted in the jurisdiction
that reported the case. Likewise, confirmed TB cases reported in suburban Cook County who may have moved out of suburban Cook
County are included in the data presented herein.
Reported TB Case Rates
Suburban Cook County, Chicago and Illinois TB rates between 1993-1999 were calculated using 1990 census data. Suburban Cook
County, Chicago and Illinois TB rates between 2000-2009 were calculated using 2000 census data. Suburban Cook County, Chicago
and Illinois TB rates after 2009 were calculated using 2010 census data. National TB rates were calculated using national intercensal
estimates.

higher than the rate in non-Hispanic Whites (70.7 per 100,000 population) and 3.5 times higher than
the rate in Hispanics (327.9 per 100,000 population).

•

Chlamydia rates among females were 2,272.7 and 1,845.4 per 100,000 population among those aged

§ Rate not calculated for n<5.

▲Table 3. Sex: Between 2009 and 2011, 55% of reported gonorrhea cases were female. Race/Ethnicity: in 2011, 64% of gonorrhea
cases were in non-Hispanic Blacks; 6.5% were non-Hispanic White and 5.1% were Hispanic. The 2011 gonorrhea rate in non-Hispanic Blacks was 394.7 per 100,000, 43 times higher than the rate in non-Hispanic Whites (9.1 per 100,000 population) and nearly 15
times higher than the rate in Hispanics (26.8 per 100,000 population). Age Groups: As with chlamydia, the majority (83.4%) of cases
were 15-29 yearsof age; of these, 80% were aged 14-24 years. District: In 2011, 51% of gonorrhea cases were diagnosed in the South
Distict and 23.1% were diagnosed in the West District. The South and West districts also had the highest gonorrhea rates in 2011
(267.3 and 94.6 per 100,000 population, respectively).

* Incidence rates calculated per 100,000 population based on 2010 estimate of the population (U.S. Census Bureau).  
¶ Congenital syphilis rates calculated per 100,000 live births (taken from Community Profiles 2003Ͳ2005).
§ Rates not calculated for n<5.

►Table 4. Syphilis Stage: Between 2009 and 2011, approximately a third of cases were classified as P&S syphilis, Sex: Among P&S
syphilis cases in 2011, the overwhelming majority of cases were males (91.2%). The P&S syphilis rate in males in 2011 was 7.6 per
100,000 population, greater than the HP2020 goal for males (6.8 per 100,000 population). The P&S syphilis rate in females in 2011
was 0.7, lower than the HP2020 goal of 1.5 per 100,000 population. Race/Ethnicity: In 2011, 70.3% of reported P&S syphilis cases
were non-Hispanic Black. District: Forty-four percent (44%) of all P&S syphilis cases reported living in the South District and 27.5%
reported living in the West District.The rate of P&S syphilis in the South District was 8.5 per 100,000, more than double the 2011

 Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance Report, 2011

Cook County Department of Public Health

TECHNICAL NOTES
Cook County Department of Public Health Jurisdiction
The jurisdiction of the Cook County Department of Public Health includes all municipalities and portions
within Cook County, except for Chicago, Evanston, Oak Park, Skokie and Stickney Township, each of which
has its own state-certifi ed local health department. Throughout this report, the term, “suburban Cook County”
refers to CCDPH’s jurisdiction with the exceptions noted above.
Data Methodology
Medical providers and laboratories within suburban Cook County are required by law to report positive cases of
chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis to the Cook County Department of Public Health within 7 days of diagnosis.
These case reports are then entered into a secure database and forwarded to the Illinois Department of Public
Health, providing the basis for the information presented in this report. Incidence rates were calculated using
population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau (2010 Census).
Data Limitations
This report includes all reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, but does not represent the entire
population of persons infected because not all infected persons have been tested or reported. Frequently, there
is a considerable lag between the time a person is diagnosed with an STI and the time the local health department receives the report. Additionally, persons with asymptomatic STIs, such as chlamydia, may be underrepresented in surveillance reports because many such individuals may not seek care, may remain undiagnosed,
and, consequently, unreported.
