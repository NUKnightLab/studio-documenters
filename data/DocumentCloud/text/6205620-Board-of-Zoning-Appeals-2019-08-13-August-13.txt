Tanganyka M. Harris request permission to change a nonconforming Clinic to 1872 square foot non-conforming Beauty

Section 61-2-46 of this Code and the Board of Zoning Appeals
may approve such change of use only where the Body
determines that the new proposed use will be less injurious to
the surrounding area than the previous nonconforming use.
