1560 E. Jefferson Avenue Brownfield Plan: Recommend Abolishment
Ms. Capler presented the recommendation to abolish the 1560 E. Jefferson Avenue Brownfield Plan to the
DBRA Board.
Section 14(8)(a) of Act 381 of 1996, as amended, states:
“A brownfield plan or plan amendment may be abolished or terminated according to this subsection
subject to all of the following:
(a) The governing body may abolish a brownfield plan when it finds that the purposes for which
the plan was established are accomplished.
(b) The governing body may terminate a brownfield plan or plan amendment for an eligible
property if the project for which eligible activities were identified in the brownfield plan or
plan amendment fails to occur with respect to the eligible property for at least 2 years
following the date of the resolution approving the brownfield plan or plan amendment,
provided that the governing body first does both of the following:
(i)
(ii)

Gives 30 days' prior written notice to the developer at its last known address by
certified mail or other method that documents proof of delivery attempted.
Provides the developer an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.”

Over the years, the DBRA has approved Brownfield Plans which describe projects that have been
completed or have failed to come to fruition (the “Plan(s)”). These Plans, particularly Plans that involve TIF
revenue, create an administrative burden for the City and the DBRA with multiple annual accounting and
reporting requirements for each Plan. Additionally, a stalled Plan prevents a new proposed development
from being able to use and/or take full advantage of Brownfield TIF. Terminating or abolishing a Plan allows
new proposed developments to make full use of Brownfield TIF financing through a new Brownfield Plan
that is in line with the new proposed development.
1560 E. Jefferson Avenue is a Plan approved by Council on January 12, 2005. The project, developed by

Section 14(8)(b) of Act 381 of 1996, as amended, allows City Council to abolish the plan as a result.

 It is the opinion of DBRA staff that the 1560 E. Jefferson Avenue Plan should be abolished due to the fact
that the project described in the Plan has been completed and the purposes for which the Plan was
established have been accomplished. DBRA staff, upon DBRA Board approval, will send a notice via
certified mail to the developer no less than 30 days before the date City Council is scheduled to abolish the
Plan.
A resolution recommending the following actions for the Plan is attached for your review and approval:
1. Recommendation to abolish the Plan to City Council.
2. Issue a certified letter notification to the Developer of the intent to abolish the Plan in no less than
30 days as well as the opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.
3. Authorization to the DBRA to terminate any other agreements or contracts between Developer and
the DBRA executed in conjunction with the Plan upon abolishment of the Plan by City Council.

Hudson’s Warehouse Brownfield Plan: Recommend Abolishment
Ms. Capler presented the recommendation to abolish the Hudson’s Warehouse Brownfield Plan to the
DBRA Board.
Section 14(8)(a) of Act 381 of 1996, as amended, states:
“A brownfield plan or plan amendment may be abolished or terminated according to this subsection
subject to all of the following:
(a) The governing body may abolish a brownfield plan when it finds that the purposes for which
the plan was established are accomplished.
(b) The governing body may terminate a brownfield plan or plan amendment for an eligible
property if the project for which eligible activities were identified in the brownfield plan or
plan amendment fails to occur with respect to the eligible property for at least 2 years
following the date of the resolution approving the brownfield plan or plan amendment,
provided that the governing body first does both of the following:
(i)
(ii)

Gives 30 days' prior written notice to the developer at its last known address by
certified mail or other method that documents proof of delivery attempted.
Provides the developer an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.”

Over the years, the DBRA has approved Brownfield Plans which describe projects that have been
completed or have failed to come to fruition (the “Plan(s)”). These Plans, particularly Plans that involve TIF
revenue, create an administrative burden for the City and the DBRA with multiple annual accounting and
reporting requirements for each Plan. Additionally, a stalled Plan prevents a new proposed development

 from being able to use and/or take full advantage of Brownfield TIF. Terminating or abolishing a Plan allows
new proposed developments to make full use of Brownfield TIF financing through a new Brownfield Plan
that is in line with the new proposed development.
