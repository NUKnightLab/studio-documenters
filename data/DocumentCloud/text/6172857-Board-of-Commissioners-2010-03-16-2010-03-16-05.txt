RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THE FY2009 MOVING TO WORK
ANNUAL REPORT
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners,
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the attached FY2009
Moving to Work Annual Report and grant authorization to submit the document to the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for approval.
FUNDING
No CHA Funding is applicable to this request.
EXPLANATION
The Plan for Transformation was approved by HUD and incorporated into a Moving to
Work (MTW) Agreement that was executed on February 6, 2000. On June 26, 2008,
CHA executed an Amended and Restated MTW Agreement (Restated Agreement)
between itself and HUD, which supersedes the original MTW Agreement and extends
CHA’s participation in the MTW program until 2018. The Restated Agreement instituted
new reporting requirements and subsequently HUD issued revised reporting requirements
in Form 50900 for public housing authorities participating in the MTW Demonstration
Program. The FY2009 MTW Annual Report is the first report to follow the new
reporting requirements and has been streamlined to reflect these changes.
Under the MTW Agreement, CHA is required to produce and submit an Annual Report
to HUD outlining the progress toward commitments made in the original Plan for
Transformation and each Annual Plan. HUD requires this report to be submitted
annually, along with a Board of Commissioners’ resolution approving this report, no later
than 90 days after the end of CHA’s fiscal year. CHA must submit the FY2009 MTW
Annual Report to HUD on March 31, 2010. The FY2009 MTW Annual Report provides
information necessary for HUD to assess CHA’s performance in 2009 regarding both
day-to-day operations and activities authorized by the MTW Demonstration Program.
The FY2009 MTW Annual Report is included with this resolution for the Board of
Commissioners’ review and approval.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to approve the FY2009 MTW
Annual Report and grant authorization to the Chief Executive Officer, the Board
Chairperson, or their designee to approve any final changes as deemed necessary to
submit the FY2009 MTW Annual Report to HUD on the March 31, 2010 deadline.
