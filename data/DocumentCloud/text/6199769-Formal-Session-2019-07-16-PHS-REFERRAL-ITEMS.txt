9. Sponsoring organizations may not include messages pertaining to tobacco and related products,

MAINTENANCE REMOVAL AGREEMENT

 

It is understood and agreed that during the initial display, and subsequent renewal periods if applicable, the perrnittee
shall be responsible for inspecting banners and poles, replacing and/or removing banners that are torn, defaced or in

It is also understood and agreed that banners are to be removed within seventy-two (72) hours of the revocation date of
the permit. Any street banner not removed within that time period shall be removed by the City without notice to the

If the City removes banners because they are in disrepair, present a threat or harm, or because the permit has expired, it
is understood and agreed that a portion or all of the refundable deposit will be forfeited by the permittee in order to
cover the City?s expense. If the expense of removal exceeds the amount of deposit, it is understood and agreed that the

excess amount shall be collected from the person/entity to which the permit was issued.

It is also understood and agreed that in such cases when the City removes banners there is no guarantee that the banners

can be reclaimed by the permittee.

A. Hanging Banner from Utility Poles

Nothing may be attached to a utility or light pole without the permission of the City. The City Council can grant
permission to attach banner to Lighting Department poles. To get permission to hand banners you must petition the
City Council. The petition should identify where you want to hang the banner(s), what the banner(s) will say and how
long the banners will hang.

No banner will be allowed to block the view of traf?c signals or signs. The Public Lighting Department will inspect the
poles before advising the City Council about allowing any banners to be attached. The permission given by the City
Council is good for up to six months. If you want to hang banners for more than six months, you should petition the
City Council for an extension.

The Petitioner is responsible for purchasing, installing and removing the banners and the hardware needed to hang
them.

The Public Lighting Department will supply a copy of its Banner Speci?cations upon request.

DATE: July 9, 2019
RE: SQUATTER ORDINANCES OR ENFORCEMENT

 

Mr. Whittaker-

I am interested in any and all City of Detroit Ordinances and or State Laws
relative to ?Squatters? in Detroit. There are a few speci?c areas I would like to
key in on:

1- Do Squatters have legal rights to properties once they enter onto a property?

2- Are there any ordinances or State Laws regulating Squatter rights?

3- How can the property owner protect themselves against Squatters?

4- What are the prescribed (if any) enforcement actions?

5- Do you have to bring legal proceedings against a Squatter to have them removed
from a property?

6- What are the civil/ criminal liabilities for property owners once a Squatter takes
over a property?

7- Are there any ?nes or criminal rami?cations for the Squatter that the property
owner can pursue?

8- Do we need to draft a proposed ordinance to protect the property owners involved
in such a dispute?

9- The (Former) Nuisance Abatement court was an avenue to determine ownership
and or legal standings in such matters, are there any current court actions at this
time?

Sincerely,

'Roy McCalistcr, Jr.\

FROM: Roy McCalister, Jr., Councilman
Public Health and Safety Standing Committee
DATE: July 8, 2019
RE: Questions regarding dynamic parking and price gauging

 

What is the ability of the City to regulate private parking garages and surface lots?
For example, could the City establish rules to deter price gauging during high traf?cked events?

Would a new parking ordinance need to be drafted in order to do this?

With regard to city owned parking lots/ garages and street parking, what is the potential to establish a dynamic
pricing model?
