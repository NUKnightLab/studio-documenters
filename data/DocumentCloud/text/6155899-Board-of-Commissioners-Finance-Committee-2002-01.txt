STATE'S ATTORNEY, Richard A. Devine, submitting communication advising

settlement of suit regarding May v. Sheahan, Case No. 99-C-0395. We have
settled this class action lawsuit for the sum of $975,000.00, which is within the
authority granted to this office by the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on
Litigation by poll on November 11, 2001. At this time, we are seeking County
Board approval of this settlement. As this is a class action lawsuit, a fairness
hearing must be conducted at which any claimant can voice opposition to the
proposed settlement. It is only after the fairness hearing, after final approval of
the settlement by the United States District Court Judge, and after time for
appeal has passed that any payouts to a claimant will be due. We expect this
to be in May or June 2002. At this time, we seek disbursement of funds to an
account on which checks to individual claimants will be drawn.
