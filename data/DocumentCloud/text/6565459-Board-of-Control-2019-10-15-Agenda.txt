Mac Casper – CEO
Reason for Late submission
This process began on May 5, 2019, plenty time to avoid being late. I had been working with the
vendor to obtain a quote that encompassed all three of their instruments. This proved to be a slow
process.
1. At this time, only one instrument, TSQ Vantage, was under a County Contract, CE1600164-01,
which expires July 31, 2019.
2. I was working with the lab and the vendor, researching the other two instruments, HRAM and
TSQ Quantis, and the dates their manufacturer’s warranty would expire.
3. I knew that it would be in the best interest of the County to include these instruments in the
current Contract to avoid an oversite when they actually did expire.
4. The vendor was having a hard time understanding our billing requirement and quoting it as
such:
a. TSQ Vantage:
August 1, 2019 – December 31, 2019
January 1, 2020 – December 31, 2020
January 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021
January 1, 2022 – July 31, 2022
b. HRAM:
November 10, 2021 – December 31, 2021
January 1, 2022 – July 31, 2022
c. TSQ Quantis:
January 17, 2021 – December 31, 2021
January 1, 2022 – July 31, 2022
5. The vendor suffered a fire at their datacenter which caused an additional 15 day delay.
6. As of July 24, I was still waiting on the vendor to provide a quote for all instruments for the
necessary terms as noted above.
7. July 25, 2019 – vendor advises that it’s not possible for them to add the other two instruments
that expire in 2022.
8. July 29, 2019 – final quote was received
28

 9. July 30, 2019 – contract draft was sent to the vendor, vendor had issue with some terms
10. August 20, 2019 – received a signed contract from vendor
The next contract set to begin August 1, 2022 should be a much smoother process as the vendor will
know exactly what we need as the precedence will be in place. Each instrument will be on the exact
same term.
