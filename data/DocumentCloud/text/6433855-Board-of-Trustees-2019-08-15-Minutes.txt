VOTE AGENDA
Telephony Disaster Recovery Solution
Ms. Vandana Vohra, Chief Technology Officer, stated the Board authorized the search of a Disaster
Recovery Solution (DR) for the Fund’s phone system and Call Center. Although the Fund’s data center systems are protected and recoverable in the event of a disaster, there is no option currently available to recover, restore and maintain the Fund’s phone and Call Center services in the event of a disaster to ensure business continuity of the Call Center. She further stated that the RFP process is the Fund’s normal procurement
means for projects costs above $50K, the office move requirements do not allow sufficient time to submit
and complete an RFP for this project. A thorough quote review process from several vendors was initiated
instead of RFP. The IT team recommends that Telephony Disaster Recovery system is implemented prior
to the office move to reduce the risk to the Fund. The team recommends allowing use of quotes from vendors for the Procurement Process. The team also recommends acquiring the solution proposed by Sentinel
Technologies to provide a resilient Hybrid Telephony DR solution, reduce telecom expense management
costs, provide for workforce mobility with softphones, and to turn up phone and Call Center business continuity service in the new office. Ms. Vohra addressed questions raised by the Board.

Motion to Accept the Staff Recommendation to Hire Sentinel Technologies, Approved
Mr. Redfeairn made a motion, seconded by Mr. Bures, to accept the staff recommendation and hire Sentinel
Technologies for Disaster Recovery Solutions, subject to final contract negotiations. The motion passed the
following roll call vote:
Ayes: Mr. Bures, Ms. Clay, Mr. del Valle, Ms. Padilla, Ms. Price Ward, Mr. Redfeairn, Ms. Reilly,
Ms. Rodriguez, Mr. Travlos, Mr. Truss – 9
Abstentions: Ms. Padilla – 1

Ancillary Furniture Purchase Approval
Mr. Charles A. Burbridge, Executive Director, and Ms. Gail Davis, Director of Administrative Services,
reported on the Ancillary Furniture purchase. They stated that on June 20, 2019, the Board authorized the
Fund to retain the services of BOS-AIS furniture vendors to furnish the new offices at 425 S. Financial
Place. Of the $795,650.00 total budget estimated for furniture, the Board approved an expense of
$346,590.53 for workstations and office furniture. Ancillary furniture, which includes but is not limited to
Board Room and Conference Room furniture, and workstation efficiency options, which includes but is not
limited to keyboard trays, tools storage bars and charging ports, were pending further assessment and evaluation by Fund staff, and were not a part of the previously approved workstations and office furniture costs.
