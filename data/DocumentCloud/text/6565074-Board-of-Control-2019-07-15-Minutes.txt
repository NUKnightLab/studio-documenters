 Paul Herdeg, Department of Development, presented. Dale Miller expressed his support for the work of
the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission as they are bringing sizable events to Cleveland and making a
difference in the community. Dennis Kennedy agreed with Mr. Miller’s comments.
Nan Baker asked why the time period is only for 6 months and if there is a specific project that the funding
is being used for; asked if the funding amount would have been the same if the request had occurred
earlier in the year and whether all the funds are expected to be used before the end of 2019; asked if
there are any commitments to projects that have not yet been paid and how has the project planning
been able to occur without this request being approved; and asked if additional funding requests would
have been expected if this request had been submitted earlier.
Trevor McAleer commented that this amount for support has never changed and was always supported
by the current administration as well as the former County Commissioners and is intended for annual
operating expenses and not a specific project; commented that in the past when proposed budget
reductions were discussed, that the funding for this organization was always restored. Dennis Kennedy

Robin Martin, Family and Children First Council, presented. Dale Miller asked if there is a plan to measure
the effectiveness of the professional development training to gauge whether quality of performance
improves and asked what assessment score is expected to be achieved; and asked how the scoring system
is determined.

 Nan Baker asked how much of the additional funding is for professional development services only and
how many sites will be served; asked if the training at the 52 sites will be web-based or in-person and if

Christine Alexander, Cuyahoga Job and Family Services, on behalf of Division of Senior and Adult Services,

BC2019-533
Sheriff’s Department, submitting agreements with various municipalities for inmate housing services in
the total amount not-to-exceed $30,000.00 for the period 1/1/2019 – 12/31/2019:
a) Village of Highland Hills in the amount not-to-exceed $25,000.00
b) Village of Woodmere in the amount not-to-exceed $5,000.00
Funding Source: Revenue Generating
Lauryn Harwell, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Trevor McAleer asked about the status of another
agreement for inmate housing services that has not yet been approved by the Board; asked if it was the
decision of the County’s administration or the municipalities or subdivision to not move forward with 2 of
the 3 outstanding agreements, as referenced in Ms. Harwell’s presentation; asked how many inmates are
being housed per year for the Villages of Highland Hills and Woodmere and what location are the inmates
being housed; asked if there were prior agreements with these municipalities; and asked what is the
estimated revenue for the upcoming agreement with the Cleveland Metropolitan Park District. Andria
Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control stated that the amount of this agreement is $36,000.00.
Dale Miller asked how many municipalities or other entities are receiving services for inmate housing and
requested a list of those municipalities or entities, including the amounts and time periods; commented
that he has a problem housing the inmates for other municipalities when the County Jail is already over
capacity that contribute to issues at the Jail; stated that the jails will be discussed at the upcoming Public
Safety and Justice Services Committee and he will ask the Chairman of that Committee to lead a
comprehensive review of policies, and recommends to rethink this enterprise given the current
circumstances, so that the County may figure out what makes sense going forward. Mr. Miller stated that
he will approve these agreements, so as not to create issues for the Villages of Woodmere and Highland
Hills but will not vote in favor of any future renewals until the Jail is at or below capacity and a
comprehensive strategy is in place before the County can take on more municipalities.

 Nan Baker concurred with Mr. Miller’s comments and asked if the amount of revenue would have been
the same if these agreements had been presented for approval in January, 2019.
Trevor McAleer asked for clarification that the County has been accepting inmates since January so the
amount would remain the same.
Ms. Baker asked for clarification on whether the County has been accepting prisoners and whether any
payments were received prior to Board approval. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve the item; Trevor
McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-533 was unanimously approved.
C. – Consent Agenda
Andria Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control stated that Sara Sandella, Department of Development
would be responding to the Council Board members’ advanced questions related to Item of Note No. 7 –
processed purchases for the 2019 Cleveland HR Star Conference in the amount of $1,295.00 for the
Department of Health and Human Services. Ms. Sandella presented. There were no questions.
Trevor McAleer referred to Item of Note No. 7 – processed purchases for the various food purchases for
the Sheriff’s Department and commented on the current status of the Request for Proposals for these
services and stated that these could possibly be the last food purchases under the existing process before
the contract is implemented, depending upon negotiations with the recommended vendor.
Dale Miller referred to Item No. BC2019-535 for proposed travel for (4) staff from the Public Defender’s
Office attending a seminar in New Orleans, Louisiana on 10/16/2019 - 10/18/2019 in the total amount
not-to-exceed $5,425.32 and asked if this conference is available in the future, as there is pending a
decision on the State budget later in the year, which could make this type of expense 100% reimbursable
rather than the current rate of 42%.
There were no additional questions on the consent items. Dennis Kennedy motioned to approve items
BC2019-534 through – 536; Michael Chambers seconded; the consent items were unanimously approved.
BC2019-534
