Agency, present such report and its analysis to the Board, and in addition,
present any potential remedies provided to County government, through its

*Referred to the Environmental Control Committee on 10/1/08.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked the Director of the Environmental Control Department, Mr. Kevin
Givens, whether he had reviewed the proposed resolution and whether the County of Cook has
any jurisdiction to review these issues.
Mr. Givens responded: regarding the sites located in Suburban Cook County “yes;” however,
regarding the two sites located in the City of Chicago “no.”
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked whether these companies comply with federal law.
Mr. Givens answered yes the facilities listed either have Title V permits, where these facilities
can emit over 100 tons of air pollution, or a permit allowing the facilities to pollute between 25
and 100 tons per year. The companies listed in the ordinance are in compliance with the
federal and state regulation guidelines for air permitting.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked for a recommendation from Mr. Givens.

Mr. Givens responded that the County of Cook should continued to review the progress of the
facilities as to what they are doing to be in compliance with air pollution in Suburban Cook
County. From an operational standpoint the Environmental Control Department is very
restrictive in terms of conducting additional inspectional activities due to our staff deficiencies.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public
speakers, in accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):
