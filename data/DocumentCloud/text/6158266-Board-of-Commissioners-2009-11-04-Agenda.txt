NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
The foregoing recitals are incorporated herein as findings of the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, Illinois.
a. The Property Defined. The Lake Parcel and the Crawford Parcel are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the “Property”. The property on which the Oak Forest Hospital of
Cook County and other County-owned facilities are located, immediately west of the Lake
Parcel, is referred to herein as the “Oak Forest Hospital Campus”.
b. Conveyance Authorized. The Board hereby determines that the conveyance of the Lake

authorizes the conveyance of the Property to the District by quit claim deed, in consideration
of a total purchase price of $15,050,000.00 (the “Purchase Price”), for the public purposes of
preserving the existing burial areas in an appropriate manner and as required by applicable
laws, protecting and preserving historic sites, and protecting and preserving the flora, fauna
and scenic beauties, in accordance with the District’s authority. It is hereby acknowledged
that the County has already received $13,261,066.00 from the District pursuant to District
Resolution No. 07-R-02-07-05, which funds shall be applied to the Purchase Price. Such
conveyance shall be subject to restrictions, covenants and easements shown of record,
easements for an existing pipeline, water line, sanitary and storm sewer lines, and an
easement for continued access by an existing roadway, and shall be “as is”, without
warranties of any sort.

to provide for the payment of closing costs customarily borne by sellers out of the proceeds at

d. Joint Planning Effort. The Board hereby recognizes that the history of the Property’s
use by the County and the history embodied on the site require careful consideration and
planning of future uses, and should be appropriately preserved and commemorated in a
manner conducive to education of the public, and that such planning and preservation is the
responsibility of both Cook County and of the District. The Board further recognizes that
access to and uses of the Property require ongoing planning and cooperation and will impact

hereby authorizes the President and his designees to engage in a joint planning effort
incorporating historic preservation, investigations, environmental restoration, and planning
for the District’s proposed use of the Property and the impacts of such use on the Oak Forest
Hospital Campus. Further, the Board hereby directs the Comptroller to set aside from the
proceeds of closing $150,000.00 to be utilized to pay one-half the cost of such efforts,
including the retention of consultants, planners and other experts, it being understood that the
District will likewise pay one-half the cost.

WHEREAS, in response to an increasingly complex world, with rapid advancements in the field of
communications, energy production, and transmission, the members of the Eighty-Third Illinois General
Assembly passed the Citizens Utility Board Act; and
WHEREAS, this landmark legislation creating the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) established a model for
the country, as an effective response to return the balance of power between consumers and industry in a
deregulated operating environment for utilities throughout the nation; and
WHEREAS, since its inception, CUB has saved consumers over $10 billion by blocking unnecessary
rate hikes, negotiating refunds, monitoring utility operations, and serving as a watchdog to ensure
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; and
WHEREAS, CUB has earned its reputation for a taking a tough but fair-minded approach to seeking
compromise solutions to complex regulatory issues, allowing utilities to earn a reasonable return on
capital investments while limiting their ability to undermine the public interest by profiting excessively at
the expense of the ratepayer; and
WHEREAS, for twenty-five years, CUB has been a tireless advocate for consumers of energy and
communications services, and has been a highly effective voice on behalf of the people of Illinois in the
legislative and policy arenas; and
WHEREAS, with over 200,000 active and engaged citizens participating in CUB’s vaunted e-action

REFERRED TO THE COMMITTE ON CONSTRUCTION #303347
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 21, 2009 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy is requesting authorization to proceed with the redevelopment
of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building for administrative offices for the Cook County
Health & Hospitals System.
On May 5, 2009 the Board of Commissioners approved a contract with Jones Lang LaSalle Americas,
Inc. (JLL) to perform preliminary analysis and planning for the adaptive reuse of the historic Cook
County Hospital Main Building. JLL analyzed the market and financial feasibility of office, hotel,
dormitory, rental housing, condominium housing, senior housing and educational uses, and concluded
that the most affordable and lowest risk reuse option is to renovate the building for administrative office
use by the Cook County Health & Hospitals System to replace 1900 West Polk, which is scheduled for
demolition.

The Department has subsequently received various applications and requests for such funds from the
community and has made recommendations for the allocation and expenditure of the same.

Suburban Publishers, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, which was previously approved on the September 16, 2009
(Agenda Item #37), to contract for the state mandated publication of the 2009 real estate non-triennial
assessment of South and North townships in Cook County, outside the City of Chicago. The amendment
increases the estimated fiscal impact.
The stricken and underscored language indicates the amendment.
Transmitting a Communication from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
by
JOHN M. FALLON, Special Assistant to the Assessor.
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for the state mandated publication of the 2009 real estate non-triennial
assessment of South and North townships in Cook County, outside the City of Chicago. Also, the Illinois
Property Tax Code requires that the Cook County Assessor provide certain notices through publication,
including publishing all "change action" on permanent index numbers.
Reason: Cook County Suburban Publishers is and has been the sole-source vendor for the publication of
Cook County's suburban townships since 2002. The state statutes have strict requirements on
the content of the publication and newspaper's qualifications. (See 35ILCS 200/12-20 and 715
ILCS 10/2 et seq.). Cook County Suburban Publishers is the only vendor that meets those
requirements for Cook County's Suburban Townships.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $300,000.00 $390,000.00. Contract period: September 16, 2009 through May
31, 2010. (040-240 Account). Requisition No. 90400035.
The Purchasing Agent concurs.

CONTRACT
ITEM #44
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 29, 2009 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a no-cost contract with Northwestern
University Center for Public Safety, Evanston, Illinois, to administer the operations of the Circuit Court
of Cook County’s Traffic Safety Program. Under this proposed contract, Northwestern University Center
for Public Safety will conduct traffic safety school instruction through classroom sessions held throughout
Cook County and through the internet for a five (5) year period beginning November 1, 2009.
Reason:

On April 28, 2009, the County issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an independent,
qualified organization to manage the Circuit Court of Cook County’s Traffic Safety Program.
This program was established by the court in the 1980s, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule
529(c) and is managed in accordance with the Traffic Safety Program Standards, adopted by
the Conference of Chief Circuit Judges. Two (2) prospective vendors submitted written
proposals in response to the RFP, both of which were qualified under the Program Standards
Section 3.05, item 4, as independent not-for-profit organizations. The Northwestern
University Center for Public Safety proposed significantly lower course fees for most
components of the program.
At current course volumes, the Northwestern University Center for Public Safety proposal
would save program participants approximately $5 million over the five (5) year period as
compared to the second proposal and $10 million as compared to the current program
configuration. For the first time ever, program participants will see a substantial decrease in
course fees, offering defendants additional encouragement to take advantage of the court
diversion alternative. Further, the fees proposed by Northwestern University Center for
Public Safety are generally lower than those now offered in other Illinois jurisdictions.
Based primarily upon their substantially lower proposed fees, their experience and
unblemished record of service with the court, and the avoidance of transition costs and
business interruption risks that would otherwise be present with a change to another vendor,
the court recommends Northwestern University Center for Public Safety for the new contract.
The Traffic Safety Program contract will not have a fiscal impact on Cook County. The costs
of the program are funded entirely by fees paid by defendants charged with traffic violations
in Cook County who receive Traffic Safety Program instruction as a sentencing option.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period: November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2014.

extension from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women for the Cook County
State’s Attorney’s Target Abuser Call (TAC) Program. The TAC Program, which began in 1997, is a
prosecution-based program built on a foundation of victim safety and offender accountability. The TAC
Program is a partnership between the State’s Attorney’s Office, the Social Service Department of the

provided through the TAC Program provide a better opportunity for victims to break the cycle of violence
while ensuring victim cooperation, victim safety and offender accountability.
This grant does not require a match contribution.
The authorization to accept the original award was given on October 18, 2005 by the Cook County Board

GRANT AWARD RENEWAL
ITEM #55
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 15, 2009 from
MICHELE V. LATZ, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State’s Attorney’s Office
requesting authorization to renew a grant in the amount of $271,238.00 from the Illinois Criminal Justice
Information Authority. This grant provides funding for the DNA Training and Prosecution Program. The
DNA Training and Prosecution Program provides training, support and assistance to assistant state’s
attorneys in cases involving DNA evidence. The program works to best utilize limited DNA testing
resources by being an internal resource for other bureaus of the office for the purpose of teaching and
consulting on how to make better use of DNA evidence and expedite cases. In addition, the program
helps to prepare all assistant state’s attorneys for the continued growth and importance that DNA
technology has to law enforcement. In addition, the program investigates and prosecutes some complex
cases that involve DNA evidence. The DNA Training and Prosecution Program dedicates one assistant
state’s attorney, one DNA Resource Specialist, and one investigator to the Criminal Prosecutions Bureau
of the State’s Attorney’s Office. This grant requires that our office match one dollar for every three
dollars of federal funding. A cash match from the Capital Litigation Fund that partially supports the
salary and fringe benefits of the grant-funded assistant state’s attorney and one investigator fulfills the
match commitment for this program.
