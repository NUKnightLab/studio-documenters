The adjustments in 2015 and 2016 to get to the accrual budget include moving benefits to the associated departments that have the staff, accruing for pension, adding
depreciation, deleting capital expenditures, and adding accrued revenue. There is an amount in 2015 reflective of CountvCare growth. The reamining adjustments are immaterial. The
increase in the subsidy line reflects the estimated pension expense paid for by the County and accrued in expenses above.

 Briefing Memorandum
AS AMENDED
To:

M. Hill Hammock
Chair, Board of Directors
Cook County Health and Hospitals System
All Directors
Cook County Health and Hospitals System

From:

Ozuru Ukoha, M.D.
Stroger Hospital Medical Staff President

Subject:

Stroger Hospital Medical Staff Bylaws Urgent Amendments

Date:

August 25, 2015

This Briefing Memorandum addresses Agenda Item Number V. D., Proposed amendments to the Bylaws
of the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County Medical Staff, for the Board Meeting on August 28,
2015. These amendments are being present to the Board as urgent amendments pursuant to Article XVII,
Section 3, Urgent Amendments.
The amendment to Article III, Section 2, Qualifications for Membership, is to comply with a Joint
Commission requirement that the Bylaws prohibit discrimination of protected classes in appointment to
the Medical Staff.
The amendments to Article V, Procedures for Appointment and Reappointment, Sections 1 and 2, are to
bring the Bylaws into line with the practice that has been followed since the creation of the Quality and
Patient Safety Committee that the Quality and Patient Safety Committee recommends Medical Staff
appointments and reappointments and not the Joint Conference Committee. In addition, since the Board
had delegated to the Quality and Patient Safety Committee the authority to approve Medical Staff
appointments and reappointment, the Board has been removed from that process.
The final amendment is to delete Article V, Section 3, Expedited Initial Appointment and Reappointment,
as unnecessary with the changes being made to Sections 1 and 2.
These amendments have been approved by the Executive Medical Staff Committee. When approved by
the Board, they will be considered provisionally approved and in force. The amendments will then be
submitted to the Medical Staff for its approval and when approved, will be returned to the Board for final
approval.

Staff Committee its recommendation that the application for reappointment
either be approved or denied. A recommendation to approve the application

(3)

(v)

Joint Conference Quality and Patient Safety Committee shall then
recommend that the application for reappointment either be approved or

Division assignment, and clinical privileges. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Quality and Patient Safety Committee may refer the matter
back to the Executive Medical Staff Committee for further consideration,
stating the reasons for such referral and setting a time limit within which
the Executive Medical Staff Committee is to report back.

JOHN JAY SHANNON, MD

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

COOK COUNTY HEALTH HOSPITALS SYSTEM
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
August 28, 2015

Recognition

Karolina Hogueisson, a mental health specialist at Cermak Health Services, and her husband, Bill, a
Cook County Sheriff?s Deputy, saved a man?s life on August 20. On their way to work that morning,
Karolina and Bill were driving down Cicero Avenue and saw a man sitting with his head between his
legs in the middle of the six lane road. With traffic racing by, they pulled their car over to shield the
man and Karolina began to talk to him. That?s when she realized she recognized the man as a past
patient at Cermak who suffers from mental health issues. Karolina successfully intervened in the
situation and was able to get the man out of the road and to a safe place to wait for an ambulance. As
you?ll read in coverage of the story (attached), even though they weren?t on?duty at work
Karolina said ?We were on human duty. We were on a duty to other humans." The actions she and her
husband took that day were admirable and very well may have saved the life of one of our patients in
need.

Randy Johnston, our Associate General Counsel, is retiring after over 33 years of service with the
County.

Randy began his legal career with the County in the Criminal Bureau of the State?s Attorney Office,
eventually heading up the Financial Crimes Unit. Randy transferred to the State's Attorney?s Civil
Actions Bureau in the late 805 where he served as a trial lawyer defending the County, including the
Health System. Before joining the General Counsel's Office, Randy supervised the Assistant
State's Attorneys who routinely provide the Health System with advice on a myriad of health law and
transactional issues.

Through the years, Randy?s hard work and dedication have earned him the respect and affection of his
many clients and friends throughout the Health System. Most of us have been the recipient of his
sage, yet practical, advice. Randy?s exceptional legal talents and unwavering commitment to our
patients and staff will be missed. Randy does not plan to ease into retirement. An established hiker,
having successfully traversed the Grand Canyon?s Rim-to?Rim-to-Rim trail, he has already scheduled a
number of ambitious hikes throughout the US.

for the Office of the President.

The President named Julius Rhodes as the Acting Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources. Mr. Rhodes

The State of Illinois continues to operate without an adopted budget for FY2016. The new state fiscal
year started July 1, 2015. Nearly 90% of the state budget has been authorized for spending through
previous General Assembly action (continuing appropriations) or through various court orders.

On August 7, 2015 HFS issued a statement that they would pay ALL Medicaid providers statewide. This
announcement was prompted by a federal judge?s order in response to a court filing made by the
Shriver Center and AIDS Legal Council of Chicago on a the basis of a Medicaid consent decree.

On August 19, 2015 Shriver and ALCC met with the federal judge and state government officials to
receive updates on progress with the Medicaid payments. The State said that they are now processing
Medicaid payments, but that delays may still occur because of cash flow issues in the Comptroller?s
office. The parties are scheduled to reconvene August 26, 2015.

Good Samaritans Save Suicidal Man Sitting In Middle Of Busy Street

Steve Miller
August 8, 2015

 

Karolina and Bill Hogueisson (Family Photo)

A couple on their way to work Friday stopped to help a man sitting in the middle of busy Cicero Avenue, but little did they
know, they had already met him.

Karolina Hogueisson and her husband, Bill, both work at Cook County Jail; he?s a correctional officer, and she?s a
mental health specialist.

As they were diving through heavy traffic on Cicero Avenue past the Ford City Mall, they saw a man sitting in the street.
?lt?s rush hour traffic. This is just a very busy street.? Karolina said.

Bill said the man was sitting ?with his head in between his legs, and cars were swerving around him, so we pulled off. We
angled our car, and put the hazard lights on, and we went to see what?s wrong.?

At first they thought he was injured. Then they realized he was suicidal.

?He was saying that he badly wanted to get home and that he hadn?t eaten anything; and he showed us his bracelet on
his arm, and he explained he?d just gotten out of the county,? Bill said. ?As we were talking to him, we even realized both
of us that he was one of our patients."

They were able to get him to safety.

Karolina said the fact they weren?t on duty didn?t make any difference to them.
?We were on human duty. We were on a duty to other humans," she said.

Karolina said she wonders why nobody else stopped.

did see people drive right by. I did. Nobody even stopped to ask if we needed help, helping anyone. That?s pretty
disheartening. It?s pretty bad,? she said.

well documented. Funding cuts in both The
private and public sectors in recent years are
disproportionately impacting Individuals
with behavioral health issues are finding
Themselves with fewer resources and in many
cases land at Cook County Jail or in our
emergency rooms simply because They are out
of Their medications or do not have access to
substance abuse services.

In The pasT several years, we have assisted more
Than 12,000 detainees in enrolling in Medicaid
gaining Them access To critical services To avoid
jail and emergency care. Some 4,500 of These
individuals chose CounTyCare as Their Medicaid
health plan which provides access to
comprehensive behavioral healTh services.

In 2016, we will Take our efforts To The next level.
You will recall that back in May of This year, we
entered into an agreement with The Community
Counseling Centers of Chicago (C4) To serve
certain CounTyCare members in need of
behavioral health services. In The coming weeks,
we intend To expand that relationship as well as
augment our current portfolio of staff and
services To provide additional services at The
Cook County Jail and in our ambulatory clinics.

 

Additionally, we are most excited about plans to
develop a drop?in center to avoid unnecessary
detention at Cook County Jail. The concept is
simple. When an individual is picked up on a
minor, non?violent offense exhibiting signs of a
behavioral health condition, he or she will be
TransporTed To a 24-7 facility for clinical
assessment, possible treatment or observation,
and linkage To community-based providers
instead of going To jail.

We expect that by expanding The 
portfolio of behavioral health services that we will
be able to reduce unnecessary and costly jail
and emergency room visits while providing a
higher level of care To The individuals we serve.

Provident Hospital In 2010 and 2011, 
leadership temporarily suspended obstetrics and
intensive care services at Provident Hospital. The
suspension of those services at the time required
formal notification to The Illinois Health Facilities
and Services Review Board the agency
that regulates hospitals in Illinois.

The has asked us To make a final
determination on Those services. To ThaT end, we
will seek approval from our Board This week To
initiate steps needed To reopen a modest
number of Provident?s intensive care beds. As The
provider of 30,000 emergency room visits
annually, we want to be able To care for and
stabilize a critically ill patient at Provident when
necessary. With regards to obstetrics, we have
made the decision To not reopen the obstetric
beds at Provident, but rather To maintain
ambulatory obstetrics at Sengstacke Clinic while
directing women we care for To deliver at Stroger
Hospital.

Oak Forest Health Center Much like The decision
To build a state-of The arT regional ambulatory
center to serve the Provident Community, we will
begin the process of identifying alternate
locations for a new south suburban regional
ambulatory center. The Oak Forest campus has
served our patients well but we need to provide
better facilities, better services and a better
experience if we expect To retain and grow our
outpatient services. The challenges of public

transportation, parking, aged buildings and
infrastructure at OFHC are far too big and frankly
too expensive to maintain.

Also contained in the budget are plans to begin
a multi?year renovation/relocation of our
community-based clinics. We have been in
many of our current locations for decades
despite the movement of our patient population.
Building size and condition, clinic volumes and
market indicators, access to public transportation
and parking are all significant factors that will
come into play as we develop a plan to provide
care in appropriate locations throughout Cook
County.

Providing the right care, at the right time and in
the right place will be key to improving the
patient experience. In addition to improving our
facilities, we will also be looking at expanded
clinic hours and modern, staffing models
designed to ensure that we are meeting our
patients? needs with the optimal mix of staff. This
may mean supplementing clinical teams with
new talent or providing more services in the
community for the convenience of our patients
rather than asking them to travel to one of our
regional hubs. We are certain the changes will
positively impact the patient experience and
look forward to your continued support.

Lastly, there is a palpable buzz around rumored
changes coming to employee parking on the
central campus. As we have discussed any
number of times over the past year, we are
turning away as many as 300 patients every day
from the Stroger parking garage. Providing
patients and their families with accessible parking
is critical if we are to improve the patient
experience. Think about your own experience as
a patient or the family member of a patient.
Would you want your sick mother to have to walk
or be shuttled six blocks to her appointment? To
ensure that our patients will have the necessary
parking they deserve, we will be leasing space in
an offsite parking lot in the very near future that
will require our central campus weekday
employees to park elsewhere. This new parking
lot will be safe with good shuttle service and for
many temporary as the second phase of the
central campus redevelopment will provide

additional parking on campus. I fully understand
that this is not a popular strategy among our
employees but I am asking you to put our
patients first and understand the importance of
this in light of the new environment we are
operating in. This is a very basic amenity that we
must provide to our patients and visitors if we
expect their loyalty. I thank you in advance for
your cooperation.

The FY16 budget has ambitious plans as we
continue the transformation of the system to
compete in the new environment. I am grateful
for the support from our board and our elected
county officials for these efforts.

More information on these initiatives will be
provided as they are developed. Should you
have any questions, please talk with your
executive leaders.

Sincerely,
Dr. Jay SW
