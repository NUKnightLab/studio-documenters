·1· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Let's go ahead and
·2· start with the round of introductions for purposes
·3· of our court reporter.
·4· · · · · · · · ·Carole, we can start with you.

·9· Office.
10· · · · · · · · ·So I think we've got a couple of
11· things we need to do today, a couple of votes that
12· we need to take.· There's also some information
13· that Tony wants to share with us.
14· · · · · · · · ·As an initial matter, just for
15· everybody, and particularly for the record, I want
16· to note that the chair of the CDF, which is usually
17· the Commissioner of the Planning Department, and,
18· of course, Andy is on his way out, unfortunately,
19· for all of us, probably good for him to go do
20· something else for a while, we want to thank him
21· for all of his years of service not just to
22· Planning, but also to CDF, and to recognize that
23· Dave Reifman, who will be the new Commissioner of
24· the Planning Department starting September 1st, I

·2· the next meeting.
·3· · · · · · · · ·Okay.· So everybody should have
·4· received the minutes for their review previously.
·5· And if there are any questions or comments on those
·6· minutes?
·7· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
·8· · · · · · · · ·All right.· Then can I seek a motion
·9· to approve the minutes?
10· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· So move.
11· · · · ALDERMAN BROOKINS:· Second.
12· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· All those in favor?
13· · · · MS. BROWN:· I'm going to abstain just because
14· I was not employed here the last time.
15· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Okay.· You may
16· abstain, Carole.
17· · · · · · · · ·All those opposed?
18· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
19· · · · · · · · ·We'll give her one go.· After that,
20· she's done.
21· · · · · · · · ·Anybody opposed?
22· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
23· · · · · · · · ·All right.· The motion passes.
24· · · · · · · · ·So, Tony, could you, I think for --

·1· we want to turn it over to Tony Smith, talk through
·2· previously approved projects, just give us a high
·3· level overview of that, and then we can move on to
·4· the status of the 2014 award.
·5· · · · MS. KOTAK:· Let me ask just one question.
·6· Did you want to move the order of the agenda given
·7· your time restraints?· If so, there just needs to
·8· be a vote of the Board.· Otherwise, we can proceed
·9· in the way that's on the agenda.
10· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· I'm okay schedule11· wise, based on some stuff we moved around.
12· · · · MS. KOTAK:· Perfect.
13· · · · MR. SMITH:· A couple new members here.
14· Tony Smith here with SB Friedman Company.· I look
15· forward to working with all of you.
16· · · · · · · · ·So we typically start off with a,
17· sort of a chronological list of the transactions
18· that Chicago Development Fund has closed to date,
19· and then in the 2015 portion down at the bottom,
20· it's a mixture of projects that have been approved
21· this year and closed, and then a couple deals that
22· are approved and in the closing process.
23· · · · · · · · ·So I'll jump down to 2015 here.
24· · · · · · · · ·So UCAN Phase 2 closed a couple

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

·1· weeks ago.· That is a new youth services facility
·2· in the Lawndale neighborhood that's just starting
·3· construction at this point.· And that was approved
·4· back in January of this year by the Governing
·5· Board.
·6· · · · · · · · ·And then Englewood Square is the new
·7· shopping center at 63rd and Halsted, Whole Foods·8· anchored center.· That was approved also in that
·9· January meeting, I believe.· And that is very close
10· to closing, probably the end of this month or early
11· next month.
12· · · · · · · · ·And then Great Central Brewing
13· Company was approved at the May Governing Board
14· meeting, and that is midway through the closing
15· process at this point.· We would anticipate late
16· September/early October closing timeframe.
17· · · · · · · · ·So we also typically update our map
18· of where CDF is invested to date.· And so the new
19· additions to the map are the UCAN project right
20· here in Lawndale, which will be very close to the
21· Homan Powerhouse Charter School, which was CDF's
22· first transaction back in 2008; and then the
23· Englewood Square project at 63rd and Halsted in
24· Englewood.

·1· · · · · · · · ·As far as construction status, so
·2· those two deals that are kind of the freshest,
·3· UCAN, so you see off to the right a completed
·4· residential facility.· That's Phase 1 of the UCAN
·5· project.
·6· · · · · · · · ·The City of Chicago was involved
·7· with TIF funding; CDF was not involved with New
·8· Markets financing.· But that is a primarily
·9· residential facility for UCAN's clientele, which
10· is wards of the state of Illinois, as well as
11· treatment and recreational facilities for that
12· client base.
13· · · · · · · · ·And the pile of rubble you see in
14· the foreground is the site of the future Phase 2
15· project that's just getting under way with
16· construction.
17· · · · · · · · ·And then off to the right, Englewood
18· Square looks fairly far along, and that's because
19· the City of Chicago still is the owner of the
20· property for the time being.· The City paid with
21· TIF funds to improve the site and get it sort of
22· pad ready and do preliminary foundation work.
23· · · · · · · · ·So off to the left you see the end
24· line retail space, so that's about 20,000 square

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015

·1· feet of multi-tenant retail.· And then off to the
·2· right you see the pad that's going to be the Whole
·3· Foods.· And then there are a couple of outlots
·4· closer to the corner of Halsted that are off the
·5· picture here.
·6· · · · MS. KOTAK:· Just one quick note on that in
·7· terms of status.
·8· · · · · · · · ·So without New Markets,
·9· our investment in that site would have been
10· significantly higher than it already is.· And so
11· it's also, when you think about it -- again, one
12· thing we talked about with the Advisory Board
13· yesterday, is just to remember, five years ago, had
14· someone told you that there's going to be a Whole
15· Foods and a Starbucks at the corner of 63rd and
16· Halsted, I don't know that they would have been
17· believed.
18· · · · · · · · ·So it's one of the projects we're
19· the proudest of.· And, again, without New Markets
20· and without CDF's investment, it wouldn't have
21· been happening, particularly -- I don't think it
22· would have been happening, but it definitely
23· wouldn't have been happening without us putting
24· more money in that now we're going to be able to

·1· use for workforce or for other investments around,
·2· which is a great story for all of us.
·3· · · · MR. SMITH:· Okay.· And then the graph here
·4· shows the historical deployment of allocation that
·5· Chicago Development Fund's received over the years
·6· starting on the left with CDF's first award in
·7· 2006.
·8· · · · · · · · ·And then it's had four subsequent
·9· awards, and so you see a spike up in the total
10· allocation each time CDF got an award, and then
11· the downtick as CDF uses those credits to fund
12· projects.
13· · · · · · · · ·So $281 million awards to date of
14· tax credit authority.· So, again, just to remind
15· or newly inform folks that -- so the tax credit
16· amount is actually 39 percent of that $281 million;
17· so the actual subsidy dollars are a fraction of the
18· allocation.
19· · · · · · · · ·So $270.5 million of that allocation
20· has been fully deployed.· The most recent award of
21· $43 million came in in June 2014, and so of that,
22· $22 million is now fully closed.· That's the Method
23· project from last fall, and UCAN Phase 2 which
24· closed a couple weeks ago.

·1· · · · · · · · ·$10 1/2 million of allocation is
·2· committed to Englewood Square and is very close
·3· to closing.· $5 1/2 million is currently midway
·4· through the closing process with the Great Central
·5· Brewing Company project.· And that leaves
·6· $5 million remaining from that most recent award.
·7· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Anybody have any
·8· questions about that for Tony?
·9· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
10· · · · · · · · ·Okay.· Tony, do you want to start
11· talking about -12· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So update on the most
13· recent Treasury announcement of allocations.
14· · · · · · · · ·So, unfortunately, on June 15th
15· we found out CDF did not get an award in the most
16· recent Treasury cycle.· So -- Aarti, if you have
17· comments on that, or I can -18· · · · MS. KOTAK:· Yeah.· So we did -- a couple
19· things.· So we did check in -- so it was -- we
20· cried that day, and we're getting over it, and
21· we're going to put in a new application obviously
22· this fall, depending on the timing that we learn
23· from Treasury.
24· · · · · · · · ·A couple things that we learned:

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 10

·1· And so you'll see some of those notes up here.· You
·2· know, essentially it's a very competitive -- an
·3· increasingly competitive process.· People are
·4· starting to better understand New Markets and
·5· starting to decode it.· So the competition is
·6· significant.
·7· · · · · · · · ·You see the mention that there is
·8· an interest that has been really prescribed by
·9· senators from rural states for them to have a focus
10· on -- on rural communities.· And that was something
11· that was missing in earlier deployments of New
12· Markets.· So we obviously -- that hurts our chances.
13· · · · · · · · ·The last point that you see up here
14· is that municipally controlled CDEs did struggle
15· as well.· And, really, our D.C. office, when we
16· checked in with them -- because we've been very
17· closely coordinated -- has said their guess is
18· that it's sort of an every other year; you sort of
19· placate some folks and grant the allocation to some
20· folks one year, and then you switch.· And so they
21· are more hopeful for the following year.
22· · · · · · · · ·But this -- this is something that
23· we're looking at.· And so we are -- I think -- I'm
24· probably stealing what's coming up behind it -- but

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 11

·1· we're talking with our -- with our Advisory Board
·2· members in particular, to build and strengthen our
·3· pipeline.
·4· · · · · · · · ·We've actually had conversations
·5· with Director Donovan, who leads the New Markets
·6· program at Treasury.· Our D.C. office, she came in,
·7· and they kind of got for us about an hour of her
·8· time to really showcase and show off what CDF does.
·9· The Deputy Mayor came in, reinforced that this is
10· really important to the City.
11· · · · · · · · ·She was -- she seems like a -12· she is a practitioner by background, and so she's
13· listened to some of the comments that we've had,
14· which we're hoping really do impact the scoring,
15· one of which is, Please, Treasury, value depth, and
16· not breadth.· Don't only give these allocations or
17· mostly give these allocations to the large national
18· banks that do sort of pockets of investment but
19· don't actually invest deeply and are, frankly,
20· disincentivized sometimes from investing deeply
21· because it's sort of the numbers help them.
22· · · · · · · · ·Sometimes Treasury will say, you
23· know, you already invested in Englewood.· Why are
24· you going back?· And we say that is completely

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 12

·1· counter to our investment strategy.· So that's
·2· number one.
·3· · · · · · · · ·Number two is also for them -- they
·4· have sort of their trends, innovation is one of
·5· them, and so they define, ironically enough, as
·6· Tony often reminds us, innovation very narrowly.
·7· So we're also trying to push them away from that.
·8· · · · · · · · ·And then the last is that often
·9· deals that are the most needed take the most time.
10· And they are right now in a very short term, short
11· life kind of mindset, which is get the allocation
12· in, prove to us that you can get it out.
13· · · · · · · · ·Shops & Lofts took us ten years, and
14· it's a critical catalyst at 47th and Cottage right
15· now.· That's the only reason that people are
16· looking east and west on 47th and north and south
17· on Cottage from that node.
18· · · · · · · · ·And so that's another thing we're
19· trying to push them towards, which is don't value
20· only those that get in and out, because the folks
21· that are really leading our communities need more
22· time to set up the projects.
23· · · · · · · · ·So we'll see if they listen to us.
24· We had that audience, which we're grateful for.· We

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 13

·1· hope to have it again in the fall, ideally for the
·2· Mayor or again the Deputy Mayor to meet Director
·3· Donovan.· We'll let you all know.
·4· · · · · · · · ·We got about a day's notice last
·5· time.· But I also think it would be valuable for
·6· her to hear from you all.· So we'll let you know
·7· when that comes to pass.· But we're hoping to make
·8· a little bit of change on their scoring, and then
·9· also have a further strengthened application.
10· · · · · · · · ·So it's bad news for this year,
11· we're hoping it's good news for next year, and
12· we're going to work incredibly hard to strengthen
13· our application.
14· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· So, Tony -- so all
15· of you all have the resolution in front of you to
16· authorize the CDF going and applying for the next
17· round.
18· · · · · · · · ·And, Tony, do you want to talk a
19· little bit to background and timing, and then adopt
20· the resolution that's in front of the Board, and
21· then we can ask the Board to consider?
22· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.
23· · · · · · · · ·So I guess, to sort of build on some
24· of the things that were already said, so the

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 14

·1· current thinking on the approach for this round of
·2· application is build on CDF's strengths.· CDF does
·3· have a great track record to date of supporting
·4· strong transactions that wouldn't have gotten done
·5· otherwise, and produce a lot of community impact in
·6· various disinvested parts of the city.
·7· · · · · · · · ·We need to have a good pipeline of
·8· potential future deals for next round, and so we're
·9· going to speak with each of the Advisory Board
10· members individually to see if there are community
11· development priorities in their parts of the city
12· that they are aware of that should be considered
13· for the application pipeline.
14· · · · · · · · ·Certainly if there's members of this
15· Board that are aware of high impact projects that
16· are coming up in the next 12 to 24 months that
17· might be New Markets eligible, please feel free to
18· reach out and let us know, or if there's folks we
19· should be talking to to learn about those projects.
20· · · · · · · · ·So basically try to do as broad a
21· sweep as we can for the most impactful, most New
22· Markets friendly projects that we can find.· And so
23· that's sort of the first component.
24· · · · · · · · ·The other component is thinking

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 15

·1· about voluntarily committing to some innovation
·2· areas in the application.
·3· · · · · · · · ·On the prior slide, we were talking
·4· about how a lot of larger service area CDEs,
·5· regional, statewide, national CDEs were able to
·6· commit to do percentages of their allocations in
·7· rural areas, or there's a group of ten states,
·8· mainly in the southeast and mountain west, that you
·9· actually get innovation credit for just doing any
10· kind of transaction in those states.
11· · · · · · · · ·CDF can't do that because Illinois
12· is not one of those underserved states as
13· designated by the feds.· CDF can look at committing
14· a certain portion of its dollars to non real
15· estate; so equipment, working capital, financing;
16· so the Method transaction, for example, done in
17· Pullman last year, CDF's funding primarily went to
18· equipment and working capital, and that worked out
19· fairly well.
20· · · · · · · · ·And the other possibility,
21· technically difficult, a lot of up-front work is
22· needed, but using New Markets to fund smaller
23· loans, the $2 million and lower in principal
24· amount.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 16

·1· · · · · · · · ·So some early ideas on that included
·2· focusing on manufacturers that are emerging and
·3· can't yet access traditional bank capital, that
·4· might need a piece of equipment or working capital
·5· to be able to grow, and/or what you call sort of
·6· impact zone loans, so making loans to businesses
·7· that are synergistic with or in the same
·8· neighborhood as larger projects CDF has financed.
·9· So things like if a supplier wants to start working
10· with Whole Foods and they are based in the
11· Englewood area, perhaps a loan for working capital
12· or equipment for them.
13· · · · · · · · ·Part of the goal, obviously,
14· with that would be not to duplicate existing
15· initiatives, particularly micro lending, in the
16· city of Chicago; so focusing on sectors and loan
17· sizes that are filling gaps, and not overlapping.
18· · · · · · · · ·But those are just some of the
19· preliminary thoughts that we've been generating in
20· discussions with DPD about how to approach this
21· year's application.
22· · · · MS. BROWN:· How necessary is it, when you're
23· looking at the smaller transaction, that it be
24· project-specific versus company-specific?· Like, so

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 17

·1· do you have to drill down as to what they would
·2· actually -- is working capital sufficient for
·3· making -·4· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· New Markets is very
·5· geographically oriented because the company has to
·6· be at least primarily located in qualifying census
·7· tracts.· But you can do multi-site business
·8· investments.
·9· · · · · · · · ·You definitely want to have the
10· strong sort of impact connection to the loan, so,
11· you know, projection that they're going to hire
12· 13 new people as a result of the financing or
13· they're going to add a new product line or
14· something like that.· So it is possible that
15· certainly with operating business financing, it's
16· more important to sort of define the impact story
17· because you're not getting a new building out of
18· the deal.
19· · · · ALDERMAN BROOKINS:· So is there a sweet
20· spot for that?· Is there a formula that makes an
21· application better than others?· Is it 10, 20, 30,
22· 40 employees?· Where is the threshold?
23· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· You know, some of the
24· national groups have sort of ratios that they

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 18

·1· target, so they want to have no less than 100 jobs
·2· created per 10 million of allocation that they put
·3· into a deal.
·4· · · · · · · · ·We don't have the luxury of doing
·5· that in Chicago; so, for example, the Method
·6· transaction created 66 jobs at Method and about
·7· 40 jobs at the other two businesses on site there,
·8· and CDF's participation was $13 million out of a
·9· $25 million total deal.· But, as you're all
10· probably aware, Method's a tremendously impactful
11· project for the City of Chicago that would have
12· failed that job ratio if CDF had that kind of
13· criteria.
14· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· For the other local applicants
15· that were either successful or unsuccessful, how
16· are we working with them, if they did receive an
17· allocation, like CCLF, for example, or if they
18· didn't or did, is there an opportunity to partner
19· with them in the prospective application?
20· · · · MS. KOTAK:· Absolutely.· It's actually a
21· point that our chairman -- our Advisory Board
22· chairman raised yesterday.
23· · · · · · · · ·So we -- we haven't -- I've had
24· informal conversations both with IFF and with CCLF.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 19

·1· I think that we will partner with them in sort of
·2· sharing ideas and sharing prospects.· So anyone who
·3· comes to us who has a deal that actually needs
·4· allocation before we get a next round, we would
·5· absolutely sort of push toward CCLF and IFF.
·6· · · · · · · · ·There's also, is it -- is it
·7· Neighborhood -- there's another housing
·8· organization that's national but has a local
·9· presence -10· · · · MR. SMITH:· The Corporation for Supportive
11· Housing.
12· · · · MS. KOTAK:· So Corporation for Supportive
13· Housing is a third that does have sort of a local
14· engagement as well.
15· · · · · · · · ·So I think it will sort of run the
16· gamut, which is first to figure out are there folks
17· coming to us that should be going to them, and so
18· making that connection.· Still being available as a
19· resource because we are, I think, the most user
20· friendly sort of entity among that set,
21· particularly because some of those are newer to the
22· New Markets sort of arena, and so we would continue
23· to be that resource.

·1· another allocation, I think there's always the
·2· opportunity for joint allocations because we're not
·3· always or often the only sort of folks in the game.
·4· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Joint allocations meaning both
·5· parties will make an allocation, not joint awards.
·6· · · · MS. KOTAK:· Exactly right.
·7· · · · MR. SMITH:· You can't have joint awards the
·8· way the program's designed, but, yeah, definitely
·9· teaming on transactions is common, and, in fact,
10· the project that's up for conversation in this
11· meeting, CDF would be working with Great Lakes
12· Capital Fund, which is a CDFI based in Lansing,
13· Michigan, as well as JPMorgan Chase; and both of
14· them have much larger geographical service areas,
15· but CDF is helping to leverage them come to Chicago
16· for a deal.
17· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And the innovative financing
18· that could take place in the form of business
19· loans, equipment financing, working capital, is
20· there an opportunity to strengthen the application
21· by partnering with the CMI so, you know -- the
22· Mayor's big push obviously has been, you know,
23· loans above 50,000, because most of the loans, the
24· average loan size is about 9,000 with CMI right

·1· now, Axion is really the only partner that's shown
·2· an ability to extend above 50,000.· Is there a way
·3· to kind of leverage the existing infrastructure,
·4· the muscle that we've built with over 200 loans to
·5· strengthen the application with those partners
·6· as a distribution vehicle, or is that -- how do
·7· you think about that?
·8· · · · MR. SMITH:· You can't make grants to other
·9· entities with New Markets funds, but you can
10· certainly partner with them.· So, yeah, certainly
11· for sort of transaction sourcing, underwriting, I
12· could see ways to build them an infrastructure.
13· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Yeah, I mean, in terms of just
14· how compelling the application itself can be.
15· · · · MS. KOTAK:· I think we'll have to.· I think
16· for the exact reason you mentioned.· And that's
17· really what we -- when I think about our, whether
18· it's our brand or our sort of ethos, it is that we
19· more than anyone else, whether it's in the city or
20· sort of even nationally, we leverage off of other
21· city efforts and other city priorities in a way -22· that Englewood Square is an example.· We've got TIF
23· in it, whether -- and the lending programs, I think
24· you've got it exactly right.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

Page 22

·1· · · · · · · · ·So I think we need to figure
·2· that out, but we absolutely need to reference
·3· partnerships between what -- among City programs,
·4· and then even among City partners, because I think
·5· that's what makes us unique is that we're not
·6· duplicative.· We actually are able to fit -- fill
·7· in gaps because we know what the gaps are better
·8· than others because we've got a sort of overall
·9· view that other folks don't have.
10· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And how does the CDFI fund
11· consider -- we talked a little bit about kind of
12· doubling down on the same area with New Markets
13· allocation dollars, but how do they consider other
14· coordinated city resources?· Is that a sort of
15· benefit, or is it, well, you don't need the money
16· there if you're already putting money there?
17· · · · MR. SMITH:· You know, that's a great
18· question.· It can cut either way.· I think that -19· and we tried to stress this with Director Donovan
20· as well, that leveraging different city resources
21· together with New Markets is a way to get very
22· challenging projects done in a way that no other
23· CDE could have, Shops & Lofts being a good example.
24· · · · · · · · ·There has been some national level

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

Page 23

·1· research, and New Markets has expressed concern
·2· that there's kind of multiple layers of subsidy in
·3· the deals, and trying to avoid double dipping.
·4· · · · · · · · ·So I think with a city-sponsored
·5· entity, the main thing is to avoid having any
·6· New Markets transaction look like it's substituting
·7· for City budget dollars, basically.· And so, for
·8· example, the new rec center at Oakwood Shores did
·9· not have CDF allocation in it, and that actually
10· would have been kind of a conflict for CDF to be
11· part of it, so third-party CDEs unaffiliated with
12· the City were a better fit for that.
13· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· I just think about, you know,
14· the meeting we have right after this is the
15· Neighborhoods Now strategy, and the different
16· planning districts in the city and the -- that
17· entire effort is going to be about sort of
18· coordinated resources across every agency and
19· every pool of capital.
20· · · · · · · · ·I think, you know, if I'm Reifman,
21· I'm thinking this is another sort of arrow in the
22· quiver for different planning areas that will be
23· priorities for the Mayor, my guess is that there's
24· a way to position that as synergistic --

·1· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.
·2· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· -- and, you know, sort of
·3· leverage.· But I think as that rolls out, it would
·4· be a compelling enhancement to our application to
·5· show that level of coordination across all the
·6· agencies.
·7· · · · MS. SANCHEZ:· In our original applications,
·8· we do state, you know, other leveraging that we've
·9· put into deals; we do talk about like TIF and land
10· and housing resources that have gone into the other
11· deals that support, you know, the CDF deals that we
12· funded with New Markets, whether it's the Oakwood
13· Shores, or Shops & Lofts or even, you know, like
14· the Homan deal at this point, when we look at what
15· we've done in that area, it wasn't just one deal we
16· did in that area, and now we're doing a second deal
17· in that area, but we also just closed, you know,
18· Sterling Apartments, which is a 180-unit housing
19· development that we're putting housing resources
20· in, as well as we're doing the 6th phase of Homan
21· Square in terms of another residential development
22· in the area.
23· · · · · · · · ·So we're having a huge impact on
24· that community.· And so those are the kinds of

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 25

·1· things that we talk about in terms of leverage in
·2· development with, you know, with New Markets as
·3· well as other city resources that we have access
·4· to, which is unique to the city, and to CDF, that
·5· other, you know, CDEs don't have access to.
·6· · · · MS. KOTAK:· And I think to your point, I
·7· think we would absolutely include it, the same way
·8· that we have with other land use efforts, like
·9· the sustainable industries effort, and even sort
10· of prior information on industry.· It's that same
11· integration which this is, you know, whether it's
12· the Method deal that falls in line with the
13· interests of the City in terms of advanced
14· manufacturing and neighborhood hiring and all those
15· things, it's -- I fully agree.
16· · · · · · · · ·And we would include, whether it's
17· Neighborhoods Now or some other efforts that are
18· going on within the department and in the city,
19· to make that exact point.
20· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Whether it's PMB effort,
21· whatever it is, I think that the, what I understand
22· to be the case and the strategy prospectively is
23· really unprecedented in terms of level of
24· coordination of capital planning and resources.· So

·4· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yep.
·5· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· This is really unprecedented
·6· for Chicago, and the level of coordination I think
·7· is a thing that we should play up pretty
·8· substantially.
·9· · · · MS. KOTAK:· Absolutely.
10· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Tony, do you want to
11· go to the time aspect of this?
12· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· And this will be quick.
13· There's a lot of TBDs on here because Treasury has
14· not announced the next round.· We're told that the
15· IRS is looking at a couple technical issues in the
16· program mainly related to refinancing of costs that
17· were incurred prior to the New Markets closing.
18· · · · · · · · ·So Treasury has been waiting -19· CDFI Fund has been waiting to issue the application
20· until that's resolved.· My best guess would be
21· October release of the application, December due
22· date, but that's just a guess.
23· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· And before -- I mean,

·1· life or a deployment clock, it needs to be used

·4· · · · · · · · ·And one million of that five is
·5· currently uncommitted dollars, so they'd be pooled
·6· together.
·7· · · · · · · · ·The scope of the project is
·8· acquisition of an existing building that you see in
·9· the picture here, it's at 13th and Paulina.· And we
10· have that building into a dedicated training center
11· that would be really kind of serving two major
12· functions.
13· · · · · · · · ·One would be manufacturing
14· training, primarily oriented to the adult -15· the disadvantaged adult population, including
16· ex-offenders, and the other piece would be youth
17· arts training, so anything from kind of pure arts
18· to very applied deals like web coding, computer
19· aided design and drafting, AV, video production,
20· that sort of thing.
21· · · · · · · · ·Projected closing date is December 1

·1· organization.· This is a new nonprofit called
·2· Chicago Center for Arts and Technology, or ChiCAT
·3· for short.· It's part of a group of affiliated
·4· nonprofits around the country.
·5· · · · · · · · ·There's currently eight facilities
·6· in operation -- this would be the ninth -- in
·7· various cities around the country, including
·8· Cleveland, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and others,
·9· that operate on a very similar model with this kind
10· of two-part youth arts education and adult job
11· training model.
12· · · · · · · · ·The genesis of the organization
13· actually dates back to the late '60s.· A gentleman
14· named Bill Strickland in Pittsburgh grew up in
15· inner city Pittsburgh, credits a high school art
16· teacher to sort of becoming his first and most
17· important life mentor.
18· · · · · · · · ·And Bill founded an after-school
19· arts program in Pittsburgh in the late '60s called
20· Manchester Craftsmen Guild.· And he had a lot of
21· success in terms of helping youth get very inspired
22· by the arts and, in the process, turning around
23· their academic careers and positioning themselves
24· for success.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 31

·1· · · · · · · · ·Bill then took over executive
·2· directorship of a group called Bidwell Corporation
·3· in the early '70s that was a job training
·4· organization that was formed in Pittsburgh to
·5· help the city recover from the steel industry
·6· displacement of work force and training for new
·7· emerging fields.
·8· · · · · · · · ·And so that sort of two-part model
·9· was developed by Bill being the director of both
10· organizations.· And they eventually merged into
11· Manchester Bidwell Corporation in the early '70s.
12· · · · · · · · ·So National Center for Arts and
13· Technology is a more recent nonprofit affiliate
14· whose job is to replicate that kind of dual model
15· around the country with local affiliates like
16· ChiCAT.
17· · · · · · · · ·So National Center for Arts and
18· Technology, or NCAT, only works in communities
19· where they have been invited, where there's strong
20· local interest and funding potential to launch a
21· new program.
22· · · · · · · · ·And so NCAT would sort of incubate
23· this new organization until at least 2017 or the
24· point where it sort of reached stabilized

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

Page 32

·1· operations.
·2· · · · · · · · ·So the model is zero cost to the
·3· participants both on the youth side and the adult
·4· career training side.· It operates on a mixture of
·5· funding sources; probably about two thirds private
·6· is typical, and about one third federal Workforce
·7· Investment Act dollars.· And so that's been kind
·8· of a robust combination that has been used
·9· consistently across the network.
10· · · · · · · · ·So 95 percent of the youth arts
11· participants graduate from high school on time.
12· So it's very inspirational to the kids that are
13· participating.· They have to maintain certain GPAs
14· and attendance records in order to stay in the
15· program.· And it also helps kind of reinvigorate
16· their interest in the curriculum they're getting
17· in high school when they see arts applied at the
18· center.
19· · · · · · · · ·And then on the career training
20· side, just shy of 80 percent of the graduates have
21· attained living wage jobs in the fields for which
22· they trained.
23· · · · · · · · ·So the Chicago facility was
24· conceived through Steve Sarowitz, who's the founder

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 33

·1· and CEO of Paylocity, which is an HR payroll firm
·2· based in Arlington Heights, who was inspired by
·3· seeing Bill Strickland talk probably ten-plus years
·4· ago, and Steve kind of made a personal commitment
·5· that if and when he ever had the resources to help
·6· launch a CAT center here in Chicago, he would.
·7· · · · · · · · ·And Paylocity went public a couple
·8· years ago, and so he did have the ability to do
·9· that.
10· · · · · · · · ·The executive director is Sequane
11· Lawrence.· So a very diverse background that's
12· actually very well tailored to kind of the dual
13· approach of the ChiCAT facility.
14· · · · · · · · ·So Sequane at one point was at the
15· Mayor's Office of Workforce Development here at the
16· City.· He was in an executive training program with
17· Tracy Sanchez, what, 16 years ago?
18· · · · MS. SANCHEZ:· Many years ago, yes.· About
19· 15 years ago.
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· So he's also helped direct the
21· Safer Foundation's Sheridan project, which is
22· an ex-offender re-entry program focused on the
23· Sheridan Correctional facility downstate, Chicago
24· Community Trust fellow in 2011, and since that time

·1· has been working to launch the ChiCAT project.
·2· · · · · · · · ·So the location, it's in the
·3· Illinois Medical District, kind of the southeastern
·4· corner of the IMD.· IMD is actually the seller of
·5· the building to ChiCAT.· And that land sale did -·6· or building sale closed a few weeks ago.
·7· · · · · · · · ·And IMD is very excited about the
·8· project because it's -- part of the training is for
·9· healthcare positions, which the IMD thinks is very
10· synergistic with its mission.
11· · · · · · · · ·The primary neighborhoods that would
12· be served by the facility are shown on the map,
13· are to the south and west of the facility:· North
14· Lawndale, South Lawndale, Little Village, and
15· Pilsen Lower West Side.· But the facility would be
16· open to enrollees from all over the city.
17· · · · · · · · ·So part of the workforce training
18· model is strong partnerships with industry
19· representatives who are going to be on advisory
20· boards to help design the curriculum for the
21· training, who are going to commit to hire a certain
22· number of graduates from the training.
23· · · · · · · · ·And ChiCAT is also asking for
24· financial support on an ongoing basis with

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 35

·1· operational grants year to year from those partners
·2· as well.
·3· · · · · · · · ·So some of the existing partners
·4· that have already signed up, on the healthcare
·5· side, Mt. Sinai, Mercy, St. Anthony Hospital.
·6· On the food industry, food manufacturing side,
·7· Lagunitas Brewing, Newly Weds Foods, and Diageo.
·8· And that list is growing week by week.
·9· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Sorry.· For the healthcare
10· training, you have 32 participants annually, and
11· manufacturing are 48, and the partners have agreed
12· to hire a certain number.· Is there a number that
13· they have committed to hire going into these
14· programs?
15· · · · MR. SIMMONS:· They are still working on
16· putting together these advisory boards, so I think
17· these discussions are in pretty early stages.· So
18· I'm not sure if there is a specific target going
19· forward with each employer.
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· So in terms of sort of the need
21· for these training programs, obviously in the -22· on the youth education side, CPS is resource
23· challenged, and therefore that impacts the ability
24· to offer arts instruction and certified arts

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 36

·1· instructors; and so this is an enrichment program
·2· that would help fill some of that gap.
·3· · · · · · · · ·And then on the job training side,
·4· the adult -- the medical assistant profession is
·5· growing; it offers a career ladder.· You can
·6· get that position, and then also train for
·7· certifications that make you eligible for higher·8· paying positions and sort of build a career
·9· incrementally in healthcare in a way that is not
10· necessarily possible in some other fields these
11· days.
12· · · · · · · · ·And then in manufacturing, there's
13· really two main areas of focus.· One is the food
14· sector, in recognition of Chicago's large and
15· growing food cluster.· Also the fact that the food
16· manufacturing sector is more accessible to ex17· offenders than any other sector of manufacturing.
18· · · · · · · · ·By contrast, healthcare, for
19· example, none of the major hospitals in the city
20· of Chicago will hire ex-offenders, except Mercy has
21· a possible exception they can go through, but it's
22· very onerous to do so.
23· · · · · · · · ·So food manufacturing is kind of
24· viewed as a path of less resistance for re-entry

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 37

·1· opportunities.
·2· · · · · · · · ·And then on the more advanced
·3· manufacturing side, there's a skills and workforce
·4· gap where a lot of the population that works in
·5· Chicago's manufacturing companies are aging out.
·6· And so the Chicago Sustainable Industries
·7· Initiative has identified about 52,000 jobs that
·8· might go unfilled over the next ten years; and
·9· looking at the supply of workforce versus demand,
10· about 1,200 positions a year may go unfilled unless
11· there's enough workforce to fill that gap.
12· · · · · · · · ·So, as Treasurer Summers mentioned,
13· 32 participants annually on the healthcare side.
14· Typical salaries in Cook County starting for
15· medical assistants are about $31,000 with benefits;
16· on the manufacturing side, 48 graduates annually,
17· with starting salaries that are preliminarily
18· estimated to range from 25,000 to 41,000 a year.
19· · · · · · · · ·I'll go faster.
20· · · · · · · · ·The youth education side,

·1· create 21 new jobs, full-time equivalent jobs, that
·2· will pay $24 an hour on average, with benefits.
·3· · · · · · · · ·I can probably skip this last slide
·4· other than to say that the training is very
·5· synergistic, not just with CDF's emphasis on
·6· accessible jobs for low income people, but also in
·7· the sectors that are being focused on as well.
·8· CDF has done multiple manufacturing deals and
·9· healthcare deals.
10· · · · · · · · ·In terms of the details of the
11· transaction, CDF would put in $5 million in federal
12· allocation.· Great Lakes Capital Fund, which I
13· mentioned, is a CDFI, Community Development
14· Financial Institution, out of Lansing, Michigan,
15· would provide $5 million of federal allocation, and
16· $5 million of State of Illinois allocation.· And
17· JPMorgan Chase would provide $2 1/2 million of
18· state allocation.· That so boils to about
19· $4.6 million of actual subsidy to the project
20· between those different participants.· So CDF is
21· maybe about a third of the total in terms of net
22· subsidy.
23· · · · · · · · ·JPMorgan Chase would be the New

·1· from the transaction, and the balance of the
·2· funding comes from philanthropic contributions,
·3· primarily from Steve Sarowitz.· So it's about a
·4· $10.1 million project.
·5· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Thank you.
·6· · · · · · · · ·Does anybody have any specific
·7· questions?
·8· · · · MS. KOTAK:· Chairman Leon, did you want to
·9· say anything about the Advisory Board?
10· · · · MR. LEON:· By the way, I'm Rafael Leon.· I'm
11· the Chairman of the Advisory Board.
12· · · · · · · · ·We approved the transaction,
13· although we expressed concerns about the long-term
14· operations of the facility because it's a new
15· organization without any financial information
16· about how they operated.· So that was the
17· reservation that we had about the long-term
18· operations.
19· · · · · · · · ·They do have money for the first two
20· years, but the question is what happens after that.
21· So they have to engage in some pretty aggressive
22· fundraising starting right now when they have the
23· money to use.· That was our recommendation.
24· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And those operating funds are

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 · MEETING, 08/25/2015
Page 40

·1· coming from the philanthropic source as well?
·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah.· So Steve Sarowitz and his
·3· former CFO have agreed to prefund the first two
·4· years of operations, and kind of less formally have
·5· agreed to fill any gaps for the remainder of the
·6· seven-year New Markets period; but the goal on
·7· everybody's part is to diversify the funding base
·8· so it's not just coming from individual donors.
·9· · · · · · · · ·And so WIA, Workforce Investment
10· Act, funds are certainly part of the plan; that
11· would be about a third of the total operational
12· funding.· You can't really qualify for WIA funds,
13· though, until you actually have a track record,
14· and so the, sort of the startup gap.
15· · · · · · · · ·But Karin Norrington-Reaves is on
16· ChiCAT's board, and they are very familiar with how
17· to access WIA funding.
18· · · · · · · · ·And then private ongoing
19· fundraising.· So they have initial commitment from
20· the Polk Brothers Family Foundation for $100,000
21· of sort of startup money, and that is hopefully a
22· gateway to more from that foundation as well as
23· others.
24· · · · · · · · ·And then, as I mentioned, the

·1· Advisory Board companies that are signing up,
·2· they're going to also ask for annual operating
·3· contributions.
·4· · · · · · · · ·So Sequane Lawrence actually
·5· instructs at UIC on organizational development,
·6· is acutely aware of the need for a diverse funding
·7· base.· And so certainly they recognize the need
·8· for aggressive diversification from day one.
·9· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Tony, what's their
10· annual operating budget?
11· · · · MR. SMITH:· It's about a million and a half
12· projected at full stabilization.
13· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· And how much are they
14· expecting to get from WIA, do you think?
15· · · · MR. SMITH:· About $450,000.
16· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· And you're saying
17· they've got a track record with other -- with the
18· organization and other places of accessing WIA
19· dollars?
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.· So the other NCAT
21· organizations, which Sequane Lawrence has visited
22· three, and he's going to visit all of the others
23· before launch; so he's looking at the funding mix
24· for each one.· But, yes, WIA dollars have been used

·2· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Rafael, just going
·3· to you all's concern, do you feel like you got
·4· sufficient answers to -- obviously you approved
·5· the project, or it wouldn't be before us -- but to
·6· address your concerns over the long term?
·7· · · · MR. LEON:· Well, we still think that it's a
·8· risky transaction, but I think that hopefully they
·9· will be able to raise the funds.
10· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Okay.
11· · · · MR. LEON:· So we're okay with it, but we need
12· to go in with our eyes open.· That the long term,
13· they need to do a lot of fundraising.· Because it's
14· easier to raise the money to build the facility.
15· The question is how do you incorporate it?
16· Especially when the participants are not paying
17· anything for the services.· So that there has to be
18· some consideration for that.
19· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Anybody have any other
20· questions, comments, concerns?
21· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Is there any -- just in terms
22· of what we're paying the IMD here, was there -- you
23· know, is this a market price, a below market price?
24· Was there some consideration that this other public

·1· entity has provided for this public good here?
·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· Um-hmm.· So purchase price is
·3· just under $2 million.· The project sponsors
·4· certainly negotiated hard and believe they got a
·5· strong deal.· And they did look at other locations
·6· around the city.
·7· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· So we're not sure if they -- if
·8· there's a sort of market discount -·9· · · · MS. KOTAK:· I doubt that there's a discount,
10· just having been on the other side of real estate
11· transactions with the Illinois Medical District.
12· (A) they can't afford it; (B) I don't know how
13· the -- statutorily, I think they do have
14· restrictions.
15· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· I think there's a debt holder
16· overseas that wouldn't allow them to do that
17· anyway.
18· · · · MR. SMITH:· They did agree to sell the
19· property fee simple, though.· That was a concession
20· that they made.
21· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· All right.· If there
22· are no further questions, can I ask for a motion to

10· or Rafael if anybody has any other issues they
11· wanted to raise or questions or comments?
12· · · · ALDERMAN BROOKINS:· I think I made some
13· comments on the phone, and one of my comments, one
14· of my pet peeves with respect to where we spend our
15· money, I was a little bit miffed that we spent
16· $18 million in economically challenged Sears Tower.

·6· · · · ACTING CHAIRMAN HOLT:· Okay.
·7· · · · MR. LEON:· If I could say something about
·8· that, because the Department has scheduled

10· Advisory Board members, so we keep being given
11· ideas on how to approach the needs for the
