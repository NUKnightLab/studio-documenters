Re: Executive Organization Plan (EOP) Amendment

Honorable City Council:

I am pleased to present to you the attached amendment to the Executive Organization Plan
(EOP). Pursuant to Section 7-102 of the 2012 Detroit City Charter, any amendment to the BOP
is to be submitted to your Honorable Body and made public. After a public hearing, your
Honorable Body is required to approve, recommend modi?cation, or reject the plan within
sixty (60) business days. Lacking such action, the Amendment becomes effective.

The proposed amendment to the Executive Organization Plan would:

1. Increase the number of Deputy Directors within the Buildings, Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department from one to two, serving under the Director of the
Department. Given the unprecedented level of blight enforcement needed to improve
the quality of life for Detroit residents, it is imperative that the Department have a
deputy director that is responsible for code.

In addition to the proposed amendment, please ?nd attached the Resolution Distributing the
BOP Amendment and Notice Thereof as well as the Resolution to Set and Provide Notice of
the Public Hearing. We are available to respond to any questions or concerns and look forward
to continued collaboration on this important issue.

Respectfully submitted,

be a representative of a local preservation organization which may be, but is not limited to, an
historic district association or resides in an historic district. The present board has several
members who meet this criterion.

Beginning in 2001, the City has been quali?ed as a ?Certi?ed Local Government? (CLG) under
the federal historic preservation program. This bene?t gives the city direct input into the
nomination of Detroit properties to the National Register of Historic Places. More importantly,
the status makes the city eligible for grant funds from the federal government.

Under the CLG program, we are required to have on the Advisory Board persons with certain
skills to review National Register programs. The skills required include, but are not limited to, an
understanding of historic preservation and the important role of culturally and architectural
signi?cant structures in Detroit. I?ve attached the following resume of Naomi Beasley-Porter for
your consideration.

As always, I am available if there are questions.

Respectfully,

.

maintaining client relationships.

RE: Request for LPD to Amend Article (Slavery Ordinance) to Include the Prison

Industrial Complex

 

In the United States mass incarceration is a serious issue that disproportionately affects black and
brown communities. More prisons in this country are being run by for pro?t-corporations and the
industry is making large amounts of pro?t incarcerating people in our communities. Mass incarceration
is widely considered a new form of slavery. Incarcerating a considerable amount of people causes
signi?cant negative social and economic problems in our community. It is time that we understand the
economics of incarceration and advocate for real reform.

I am an advocate for the overall reform of the criminal justice system in this country. Therefore, I
believe that as local government we need to ensure that we are doing our part to address the issue. I am
requesting that LPD draft an amendment to Article of the Detroit City Code that includes a
disclosure requiring prospective contractors with the City, to disclose or deny by an af?davit, whether
it has ties or interest in the prison industry.

Thank you.
