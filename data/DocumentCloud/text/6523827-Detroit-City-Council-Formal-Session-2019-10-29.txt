Certificate Amendment, in the area of 7000 Georgia Detroit, Michigan in
Accordance with Public Act 198 of 1974 on behalf of Flex-N-Gate. (Petition
#1185). (Prior to the requested amendment, the original IFEC for Flex-NGate Detroit, LLC was approved on October 11, 2016. Then in 2017, as
required by State Tax Commission (STC) rule number 54, which states, “if
the final costs of a project are greater than the original application amount
by more than 10%, then the certificate holder shall request that the local
government unit approve the additional costs”; Flex-N-Gate Detroit, LLC
requested an amendment to IFEC #2016-158 to update their real and
personal property costs from $95,075,000 to $160,000,000. The IFEC
amendment was officially approved by the Council of the Whole on October
17, 2017. However, upon submitting the approved amendment to the STC it
was discovered that the original IFEC was only approved for the real
property component and that the personal property component was abated
under the Eligible Manufacturing Personal Property Tax Exemption
program. As such the originally approved amendment should have only
amended the real property costs from $40,000,000 to $100,000,000.)

information. The Property has since been conveyed by Wayne County to the
Detroit Land Bank Authority (“DLBA”).)
