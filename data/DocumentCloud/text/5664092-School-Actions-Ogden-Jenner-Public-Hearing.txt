MR. METCALF: Good evening, everyone.
We are getting ready to begin the community
meeting on the proposed Ogden-Jenner merger, but
before we begin, is there anybody that needs the
assistance of a sign language interpreter? Is
there anybody that needs the assistance of a
bilingual Spanish interpreter?
Those services are here, and the sign
language interpreter as well as the bilingual
interpreter will remain until the end of the
meeting.
One comment before I begin. At some
point we will dim the lights so that everybody
can see the presentation that is behind us now.
We'll slide over to make sure that everyone can
see it.
So before we begin, I would like to
welcome everyone. I would like to thank you for
coming to speak with us today. This meeting is
part of the proposed Ogden and Jenner
consolidation which was formally proposed on
December 1st of 2017 after months of community
engagement leading up to the announcement.

My name is Brian Metcalf and I am the
chief officer for Network 6 for Chicago Public
Schools. I am here with Cheryl Nevins who is
from the Office of Demographics and Planning, as
well as Natasha Patterson who is the deputy
chief of schools for Network 6 for Chicago
Public Schools. We are here today on behalf of
our interim CEO Dr. Janice Jackson to share some
basic information and to hear from you about
this specific proposal.
Will you please dim the lights? As I
mentioned a moment ago, the purpose of this
meeting is to allow CEO Jackson and the Board
office to hear feedback from you about the
specific proposal under discussion. I will
start by running through a brief introduction
and logistics again, and then Cheryl Nevins will
run through a brief presentation providing
information related to the proposed action.
After this, we will allot the remaining
time for public comment. The meeting will end
promptly at 8:00 p.m. In addition, we will have
representatives from the office of ODLSS which
is the Office of Diverse Learners and Support.
We also have a member from the Talent team so
that's for human resources. And we also have a
member from Students in Transition Living or
Temporary Living, and then Laura Gadrey

This group of people will be available
30 minutes after the conclusion of the community
meeting to answer questions you may have
specific to their area of expertise. Please
note that these members are not formally a part
of the community meeting and the stenographer
and note taker will not be present to record
comments made.
If you did not have a chance to come in
early or do not wish to provide your comments at
this meeting, there are a couple other ways you
can submit your comments, and one of those ways
is to transitions@cps.edu. You can also submit
written comments at the registration table. A
staff member at the desk will provide note cards
for written comments. If you have not received
one yet, please feel free to stand outside at
the table where you sign in and you can get a
comment card.
So again, if you do not wish to speak
in this public setting, we still want to hear
your comments and so you can do that by
submitting your comments to transitions@cps.edu
or you can use the note cards provided out at
the resource table.

reference the transition plan regarding this
school action at cps.edu/transitions. In
addition, meeting notes from each community
meeting will be available online at
cps.edu/transitions within five days of this
meeting.
Again, if you have any questions
regarding or surrounding the proposed transition
meeting, you may access that at
cps.edu/transitions, and likewise within five
days you can go to cps.edu/transitions and
receive a summary of all of the questions or
comments that will be asked tonight.
And at this moment I am going to turn
it over to Cheryl Nevins who is going to take us
through some of the highlights of the proposed
action.
MS. NEVINS: Thank you, Brian. We're
on Slide 4.
So with respect to this process, it's a
part of a larger legal process, and again I'm
just going to outline those two dates. October
1st, CPS published draft guidelines for school
actions. On December 1st, CPS proposed school
actions, and sent notice letters and draft
transition plans. Final transition plans will
occur in the spring after the action is voted
upon by the Board.

You should expect final transition
plans to be ready at that time, but just to note
that the draft transition plan is a breathing
working document that in response to the school
community meetings that we're having tonight and
we had last week, that this is the opportunity
to be heard for leadership to consider some of
these ideas to incorporate into the updated
draft plan.
January 2018 is where CPS will hold two
community meetings. This is our second of those
two community meetings tonight, and we will hold
one public hearing down at Central Office on
January 25th 4:30 to 6:30 p.m.
February 2018 or later CPS can make
recommendations to the Board after these
community meetings and the public hearing and
the Board will vote on any recommended school
action, so the Board may vote as early as the
February Board meeting.
With respect to our engagement, where
we are to date, the community engagement process
started back in 2015. A steering committee was
formed in the spring of 2016. There were three
well-attended community meetings, one in
February of 2017, March of 2017, and April of
2017.
In addition to that, we know in the

past year many of our students have participated
in JOLT activities, Jenner and Ogden Learning
Together, and staff at both Ogden and Jenner
have worked as stated at many SEED activities
with respect to racial implicit bias training
and diversity training.
Some of the key things we have heard so
far is the desire to keep the International
Baccalaureate program and provide robust
academic supports to our transitioning students,
the desire to maintain Jenner's strong culture,
including teachers and staff, and continuing the
N.E.S.T. philosophy. Other items that we heard
is a necessity for transportation to be provided
between Jenner and Ogden East campuses,
additional activities and training to bring
school communities together which would include
parents, teachers, and students.
We also heard Grades K to 4 at Ogden
East as well as serving Grades 5 through 8 here
in the Jenner building, and lastly we have heard
about a desire for Jenner's current 8th grade
students, if they choose, to have the option to
enroll in Ogden International for 9th grade.
And I said lastly, but there is one
other important item. We have heard that it is
a necessity and a need to have a pre-K class
here at the Jenner facility.

As you'll see in the overview of the
proposed school action, Ogden International
would have three buildings. Ogden's boundary
would include Jenner's current boundary. There
would be no changes to Ogden West. It would
serve Grades 9 through 12 at that building, and
once against Jenner 8th grade students would
have the ability to enroll in Ogden West if they
choose for 9th grade.
The three-building footprint would look
like this: 24 West Walton would serve Grades K
to 4, 1119 North Cleveland would serve Grades 5
to 8, and 1250 West Erie would serve Grades 9
through 12.
Some of the more specific details of
the proposal -- and again, as Brian indicated,
you can look on the CPS Transitions website if
you are looking for more details, but I would
like to highlight a few for you now.
CPS has budgeted approximately 1.8
million over the next three and a half years to
support the transition of the students. We do
have a budget meeting coming up at the end of
this month where we can begin to look at the
specifics with respect to what the needs would
be this semester if the action was voted upon,
as well as outlining needs for year one and year
two, again if the action was voted upon.

Staffing supports. There would be an
assistant principal, a school counselor, and a
school clerk at each of the three buildings.
There would be a principal and a school-based
transition coordinator to assist with the
implementation of new programs and practices at
each school. The principal transition
coordinator would be a retired administrator
working with the staff at both Ogden and Jenner.
The school-based transition coordinator
is perceived to be more of a parent-student
liaison to assist with the transitioning
process, and I believe both of those job
opportunities are posting immediately so that if
the action were to be voted upon, we could get
some support in place right away.
Such an office would be providing
additional professional development for all
teachers and, lastly, providing IB training this
spring, as early as this spring to those
teachers not previously trained in IB.
So additional details of the proposal
are School Climate Supports, creation of a joint
Culture and Climate Team as well as a joint
Behavioral Team. This will be something that
would occur this semester as well.
The implementation of Responsive
Classroom, SELF, a restorative practice coach

from Central Office in the schools at least once
a week, and again we would make a commitment to
continue the work that has been started at both
Jenner and Ogden continuing to focus on
diversity, inclusion, and cultural and racial
awareness.
Again, we would continue to work with
the students with JOLT activities and the
integration activities that the staff at both
Ogden and Jenner have done through SEED.
Lastly, some of the logistical supports
of the proposal are transportation between
Jenner and Ogden East would be provided. We
would discuss and explore standard start times
for the three-building footprint. We would
review security officer staffing levels and the
need for Safe Passage program for students
traveling to the new school, and district
representatives from ODLSS will work with
families and students during this transition and
continue to work with them.
At this time I'm going to turn the
microphone back over to Brian so that we can -Mr. Metcalf, excuse me -- so that we can begin
our public comment.
MR. METCALF: Thank you, Cheryl.
We're getting ready to begin the public
comments section, but before we do, I want to

make sure that we go over a few kind of
logistical things that we need to make sure we
take care of prior to actually starting.
So during public participation, each
speaker that has signed up to speak will have
two minutes to share their thoughts. You will
get a one-minute mark, then a 30-second mark,
and then finally a sign that will indicate when
your remaining time is up.
Speakers, we are asking that you
approach the podium and make sure that when
you -- before you speak, give your name, speak
slowly so that our stenographer can capture the
full spelling of your name, and your affiliation
with either Ogden and/or Jenner, so parent,
community member, teacher, parent, student.
So in addition, we want to make sure
that for the allocation of time, we need to make
sure that everybody that has signed up to be
heard, we're going to ask that you strictly
adhere to the two-minute time period. There
might be additional opportunities for you to
speak again. We'll go into that a little bit
later.
This meeting is scheduled to end at
8:00 p.m. The comment period will last until
the scheduled end time of the meeting. If there
is time remaining, we are going to open it up

again for you to go and reregister and sign up
again.
So, for example, if we're finished with
the public comment section at 7:15, we are
required by law to remain here until 8:00 p.m.,
and so with that remaining 45 minutes, if in
your two minutes you were not able to convey all
of your thoughts, you can go back and sign up
again and then receive another index card to
approach the podium again, but we will give
priority to anyone that didn't sign up for the
first round, they will have priority the second
time.
To begin public comments, I would like
to thank and welcome Principal Michael Beyer
from Ogden and Principal Kelly Shelton, the
principal the Jenner. Can we give them a round
of applause?
(Applause.)
MR. METCALF: And then we have Alicia
Ivy, a representative from Walter Burnett's
office that is here representing Alderman
Burnett. Can we give her a round of applause?

MR. METCALF: So at this moment I am
going down the list and then we will begin. As
I call numbers, we ask that you approach the

Can you state your name slowly and your
affiliation with either Ogden and/or Jenner?
And can you spell your first and last name for
us so that the stenographer can make sure that
she has the correct spelling? Because keep in
mind that these -- this report will be published
within five days and we want to make sure that
we have as much accurate information as we can.

MS. JUSTICE STAMPS: Justice,
J-u-s-t-i-c-e, Stamps, S-t-a-m-p-s. So I have a
couple of -- so should I start?
So you noted that you all started the
official process in 2015, so that means that we
are two plus years in the making of us not
having established boundaries, clear-cut
boundaries. You all glossed over a little bit
about maintaining Jenner's boundaries.
However, the boundaries that were
previously in place for Ogden were skewed and
actually probably borderline illegal if you ask
me. So I want to know, how are you all
revisiting those boundaries?
Our concern about the training for

parents on racial sensitivity, you all flew over
that part as well. In the previous public
meetings that I have attended, it was clear cut
to me that several of your parents from one of
the merging schools definitely would clear cut
need this training.
So I think that you all need to be more
explicit on what that training will be and how
parents would be incorporated in that. Because
from my experience in working with students from
Jenner Academy and their conversations, they
don't have a problem with getting along.
The third concern, which is an
extremely important concern, is I walked in a
few minutes late. So did I miss the part where
you guys talked about the Jenner name and Jenner
branding and keeping Jenner? Why is it becoming
Ogden International three-building anything?
Is that going to be explained somewhere
explicitly or was that explained in another
meeting? What is the input as it relates to
that? Because Jenner cannot move its branding,
and I don't think that it should just become
Ogden International across the Board.
And the last part is actually directed
specifically to Walter Burnett's spokesperson
for the day. It is so noted that he was at the
other meeting at the other school but he is

Jenner students.

MS. KACHORIS: Good evening. My name
is Ianna Kachoris spelled I-a-n-n-a, last name
spelled K-a-c-h-o-r-i-s.
I am the parent of an Ogden student and
a proud alum of Chicago Public Schools. I am
proud to stand before you this evening and
wholeheartedly give my endorsement to support
the Ogden and Jenner merger.
To the last speaker's point, I would
also agree that we need to honor the history of
Jenner and suggest that we call it Jenner Ogden
International School of Chicago.
There are several reasons I support the
idea and am proud to be part of this effort.
First and foremost, it is the just thing to do.
There is no justifiable reason that children
should have disparate education just because
they live on one side of a boundary that was
gerrymandered over 50 years ago to separate the
children of the Gold Coast from the children of
Cabrini-Green.

None of us here are responsible for
designing the neighborhood boundary maps, but if
we do not seize this opportunity to change them,
we are complicit. If the moral argument does
not sway you, there are several more that I
think make this school action stand on its
merits.
First, the proposal is evidence based.
I spend my days working on how research can
better inform policy and practice, and I
most recently led a research initiative at the
MacArthur Foundation and now work at the
University of Chicago on urban policy
and research.
The evidence is solid. School
integration efforts have one of the highest
returns on investment of any educational
intervention and have positive benefit for all
kids.
Second, this proposal is data driven.
An independent consultant was hired to conduct
quantitative and qualitative analysis providing
a substantive look at the demographics, space
considerations, concerns and hesitations voiced
by both, both communities. It was an important
step in identifying how both schools can benefit
from this school action.
The proposal was also conclusively

developed. The Steering Committee is comprised
of faith leaders, parents, community members,
and teachers from both schools. It has taken
hard work and true commitment to honor the
voices and perspectives of everyone so that we
can have a plan that reflects what is in the
best interests of both schools and honors the
best of what each school has to offer.
Finally, this proposal is community
driven and supported. The engagement of the
Steering Committee has been persistent and the
quality of the transition plan reflects a shift
that we have seen from CPS to here and be
responsive to our prodding.
If I could just finish with one more
last point. It's really difficult to not invoke
Dr. Martin Luther King as he discussed this
idea. He said, "The ultimate measure of a man
is not where he stands in moments of comfort and
convenience, but where he stands at times of
challenge and controversy."
It is time for all of us to get
uncomfortable and do the hard work so that our
kids can be proud of a community that supports
each of them to learn life and from each other
and to succeed in school and life. Our kids
deserve nothing less.
(Applause.)

MS. NEWMARK: Good evening. My name is
Stefanie Newmark, S-t-e-f-a-n-i-e N-e-w-m-a-r-k,
and I am a middle school diverse learner teacher
at Ogden International.
I became a teacher because I believe
all students can learn and all students deserve
the right to an equal education. Ogden has the
same philosophy, which is why I wanted to teach
there. At Ogden, all students are included
within the general education setting.
Teachers use differentiation in order
to reach each individual student in the
classroom. Differentiation can range from
teaching the same material for the whole class
using various learning styles to flexible
grouping wherein the teacher delivers the same
lesson at varying levels of difficulty.
Teachers are constantly collaborating
with both diverse learner teachers and grade
level teams in order to accommodate and modify
content to meet the needs of each student in the
class. Some can argue that they don't believe
that we can reach both excelling and struggling
students in one classroom, but at Ogden this is
done every day with success.
I strongly believe that with teamwork
and collaboration we can integrate Jenner and
Ogden students in a classroom and deliver

MS. KACHORIS: Good evening. My name

K-a-c-h-o-r-i-s.
That was my sister that spoke a couple
people ago, and she clearly has the speaking
gene. I do not.
But I did want to also get up and speak
in strong support of the merger, and I would
also like to thank everyone that has been
engaged in this process over the last couple of
years on both sides of this because it's because
of people that have been pushing us to make sure
we're including in this transition plan the key
important topics, and I also echo being able to
keep the history of Jenner included as we move
forward in how we think about the names of the
school and bring these schools together. So I
agree with those comments as well.
I also want to say that I've spent
countless hours over the last couple of years
talking to individuals about the benefits and
challenges of this merged Jenner and Ogden.
With others, we shared information to CPS to
help inform this draft transition plan. We put

in steps to ensure that the transition plan was
as detailed as possible and that it addressed
the questions and concerns raised by both school
communities.
And as my sister said as well, we have
seen the leadership from CPS and they have
greatly valued the input that we have provided
and have tried to address as many of the
concerns and considerations that we have brought
forward.
We know that this merger is going to
take a lot of hard work and we expect that both
school communities continue to be engaged and
hold CPS accountable throughout this entire
process.
So that's all I wanted to say, but I
also wanted to make sure as we're here tonight
that we really are listening to the Jenner
voice because that is so important. Thank you.

I thoroughly enjoy spending my time at
Jenner and interacting with the students.
Growing up in Chicago's public school system, I
noticed the lack of genuine relationships
between students and faculty. I began working

together every week with Mr. Castro on Fridays
and I feel the relationship with all the
students that I have come in contact with. I
actually value all these relationships.
I think that it's important for Jenner
students to know that they have support
(inaudible).
I also wanted to add that me and other
students of Ogden are so devoted and committed
to making sure that these healthy relationships
and any relationships are formed, that we have
created a place where students teach staff
members how to communicate (inaudible).

MS. FINEBERG: Hi. I'm Leslie
Fineberg. I'm an Ogden parent and an Ogden
alumni.
My first question is, $1.8 million
sounds like a lot of money, but as you walk
through the school here, there are no lockers.
My hope is that that expense is not going to
come out of the $1.8 million.
I would also like to know in terms of
money, how is CPS going to make up for the
millions of dollars in Title I funding that is
going to be lost that Jenner has now when we
merge? All of these services that are going to
be required cost money, and that $1.8 million is

a drop in the bucket. If CPS really wants to
make this a successful consolidation, they need
to step up to the plate.
My biggest concern is that Jenner is
not a community school and Ogden is borderline a
community school, and with this merger these
boundary lines create the largest school
district within CPS, probably within the state,
and it will no longer be a community school.
How is CPS going to deal with that and
what are they going to do? I have said at
meetings in the past there are 5,000 new homes
being built in the Jenner school district over
the next three to five years. If we're not
overcrowded now, we're going to be overcrowded
in three to five years.
Now is the time to redraw boundaries
and make this a success. We're setting this up
for failure because all of a sudden you are
going to have a building boom and I keep getting
told that it's going to be people coming in that
don't have families yet and there is going to be
newborns and it's going to be five years until
their children are school age, and I don't buy
that for a second.
I think that there are thousands of
families buying in this area who are not sending
their children to Jenner but who will send their

children to Ogden if this merger goes through,
and that's a great thing.
I think that desegregation and merging
these schools has some phenomenal qualities, but
I have huge concerns as a parent and as a
community member that it just isn't going to
work because nobody is thinking far enough into
the future.
I heard one of the speakers talk about
disparate education. You would assume that if a
principal has a right to hire the teachers that
they want to hire, that the education should be
extremely similar. They are not. But that's
not the fault of the Jenner students or the
Jenner community.
Finally, I would ask for a parent vote
at both schools to determine what the true
percentage of parents of actual schools -sorry -- students who attend the schools is in
favor of this merger. Thank you.

W-a-l-k-e-r.
I'm a senior at Ogden, and as a member
of the Black Student Union, I know there are a
variety of positive spaces for young black minds
to come together. They have constantly been
created.
Our student organizer, Mr. Castro, had
told me about his work with youth at Jenner, and
I was encouraged to participate in a mentorship
program here. My job was to first observe and
then help with acceptance.
I had never participated in any type of
interim program, and I feel grateful for being
able to interact with these students in a way
that I wish all staff interacted with me as a
student and as a person.
So it's important to build these
relationships without students feeling inferior
but also being able to look up to me.
Therefore, I'm in favor of this merger as long
as it's genuine.

has gone through a school closing -- I was
actually a teacher at a school that closed
during the 50 closings back in 2014, so I know
how it feels to be on both sides of the fence
here.
I want parents to really understand
that there is a lot of value in an IB education,
and I want them to feel that this merger is kind
of at the forefront of student safety. For
example, students in the classroom, within the
curriculum there is so many opportunities for a
student to learn different values.
One of the quotes that my students
learned just last week and was able to actually
take back to their parents I wanted to speak on.
It's, "Our lives begin to end the day they
become silent about things that matter."
First graders are learning things like
this, and they're able to talk to their parents
about it and their friends about it. And so
throughout the school students have a safe
space, and throughout the school community I
just kind of wanted to let parents know that
there are teachers and there are staff members
and community members that do support students
no matter what they look like, no matter where
they're from. And at Ogden the goal really is
to meet the needs of all students by using

differentiation throughout all subjects; for
example, reading, writing workshops, small group
instruction during math, at centers and
activities.
And the previous teacher that spoke
kind of spoke a little bit about making sure
that we meet students where they are. That's
very important, and that's what we do. So I
just wanted to point that out a little bit.
Thank you.

MR. WAGNER: Hello. I'm Jeff Wagner,
J-e-f-f W-a-g-n-e-r. I'm a teacher at Ogden
Middle School, West Campus. This is my eighth
year at Ogden. I'm a national board certified
teacher. I'm the department chair for Grades 6
through 12.
I heard that at previous meetings there
may be some concerns that teachers will have a
tough time at Ogden meeting students that are
learning at different levels. I heard my
colleague Stefanie and another colleague just
speak about this.
So if you think that's not happening
already at Ogden or at Ogden West or the middle
school, you're mistaken. We have a huge
diversity of students, not just within grades
but within classrooms, and as my colleagues have

talked about, we are teaching and meeting them
where they are.
This is not just teachers and what we
think. In my 8th grade class, students that are
included have ability levels and (inaudible)
expected progress from winter to winter, and 80
percent have made the progress that they are
supposed to. 90 percent of students have made
progress in the first place. So this is
happening.
So there was a little bit about it
before, but in the middle school there is
individualized to a certain extent reading
assignments. Students read their own novels
selected at their own levels. Students are
reading nonfiction, so the class will be reading
all of the factual information but from articles
at different levels. Many times students don't
even realize this is happening. There are
curriculum training where students often work
with students at their level or work with other
students.
And we believe it's the best thing to
do, that learning is not just talking about data
and reading skills, but learning about
diversity, and you learn about diversity from as
many different people as you can.

here to talk to you to support the merger that
is happening or may happen between Jenner and
Ogden.
Most importantly though, my colleagues
Stefanie and Mr. Wagner, Jeff, we really wanted
to talk about the concern about differentiation
and what does that look like when you have
students in your classroom of many different
ability levels which we have at Ogden?
We have students who test in the 1st
percentile and we have students who test in the
90th percentile. And as a math person, how do I
meet their needs? How do we meet their needs as
a diverse learner teacher? How do we meet their
needs as an English teacher?
And I'm going to tell you something:
the Ogden Campus is magical. It really is,
because you have teachers that are collaborating
and working together so hard to meet the needs

of every kid. At the end of every day we are
looking at one another saying, Am I meeting
their needs? What can I do differently? What
can I change?
We are very passionate about that. But
not only that, I have had the privilege of being
a part of SEED. I have gotten to meet the
Jenner teachers and, my goodness, guess what?
They are in on the same exact thing we are.

and we love our students, and we can all love

A good question for us tonight.
Towards the end of his sermon, he had these two
sentences that we shared from our pulpit. "Let
us be dissatisfied until the dark yesterdays of
segregated schools will be transformed into
bright tomorrows of quality, integrated
education. Let us be dissatisfied
until integration is not seen as a problem but
as an opportunity to participate in the beauty
of diversity."
Certainly working with the Jenner Ogden
Steering Committee and getting to know this
community is to get in touch with the beauty of
diversity. And as for the final community
meeting -- there is more hearings but this is
the final community meeting -- I think all of us
can reflect on how our relationship with CPS and
the community has grown from looking for best
practices for doing what's right and for trying
to obtain that beauty of diversity.
But Dr. King also spoke about
dissatisfaction, and on behalf of the entire
steering committee, I want to talk about our
continuing dissatisfaction that we pledge for
the future. It won't be easy going forward, and
the Steering Committee is not going to go away
if this merger happens. But this Steering
Committee is here to help make sure this merger

my thoughts. I asked myself should I just be
still while others speak? Should I come forward
and give a declarative and just state, I'm for
the merger between Jenner and Ogden, and exit?
No to both. And instead I want to have
your attention right now. This is a personal
moment in time for me. I was sitting in I-55 in
brutal traffic, as I do in the mornings and
evenings from Jenner to home since December of
2016. And I'm sitting in my car wondering what
will I put on for dinner for the family and
reflecting on my day of what went well at Jenner
and what did not go well at Jenner. And a
powerful whisper in my ear came, Read the back
of the truck, Kelly.
I said, Okay. Is this you, God?
And the words spoke to me. The
opportunity God has for you is right in front of
you.
And I paused and I thought about it,
and it was God. I actually believe that in my
heart of hearts and in my faith. This
opportunity is about bringing Jenner and Ogden
together. This opportunity will make a
difference. This opportunity will mobilize my
own efforts and the efforts of others right here
right now in the merger between Jenner and
Ogden.

This opportunity can and will create

surely we can eradicate ignorance, hatred as we
bring all together from all backgrounds.
So I will take this position right now
in this moment in time. This opportunity can
and will bring renewed faith into our hearts
coupled with fortitude and love and inspiration
now and for years to come, and even though this
opportunity, this merger -- I'm not going to say
potential merger -- this merger has been mocked
and it's feared by some. Sadly, it has.
But guess what? This merger will
further the alliance until spirits of these
young students from both communities have
reached its victory. These young human beings
are intellectual. These young human beings are
civil, powerful, and unequivocally beautiful.
And this precedent action will provide
world-class education that is paramount to all
of the learning institutions.
So I do support this merger, and I
close by stating respectfully, please know that,
because my boss is sitting right here. Okay?
Respectfully because that's who I am as a human
being, as a wife, as a mother, and as a leader
at Jenner, I respectfully and confidently and

week's meeting -- I don't know if they are here

to have some pessimistic undertones which I did
not appreciate, and I'm just being transparent,
because it was about my teachers.
So I need that person if they are here
tonight to just trust this opportunity. Please
trust this opportunity because when you have
teachers at Jenner who come in early and stay
late and come on weekends and teach lessons, we
are community lawyers, lawyers from the top law
schools and law firms to teach alongside of
them, teachers at Jenner who are affiliated with
big companies to make huge donations, teachers
who are nationally board certified, teachers who
give up their personal time to sit with a child
to learn about their hopes, dreams, fears,
struggles, to learn about the human being.
And a teacher who was once (inaudible)
for eight years and went back to school to get
his degree and (inaudible) one in art is
teaching our children right now. And I can go
on and on tonight because we have so many
teachers like that at Jenner, but that would

to all of you, I welcome you to come to Jenner
to watch the amazement. Thank you.

PRINCIPAL BEYER: I'm Mike Beyer,
B-e-y-e-r, principal of Ogden. So I'm here
tonight to say I support the consolidation and
confident it will work. Our Interim CEO
Dr. Janice Jackson and the entire network, we
are interested in providing Ogden and Jenner the
support we need.
I really have so much respect for Ogden
and Jenner parents, and while we know that we
will do everything in our ability to make sure
every child is supported, I also want you to
know that I want to make sure the learning at
both schools won't be affected and this will be
borne by all the research on school
desegregation.
There are schools with a higher rate of
poverty that demonstrates better student growth
than Ogden, and also there is a lower rate of
poverty that demonstrate worse student growth
than Ogden (inaudible) regardless of the
demographics, the socioeconomics of the students
(inaudible.)
Jenner students, like all children, can
become the (inaudible) as their peers.

My name is Randall Blakey.
I serve as executive pastor at LaSalle
Street Church, executive director of Near North
Unity Program and also co-chair of the Jenner
Ogden Steering Committee.
I want to state first and foremost for
the record my appreciation for Alicia Ivy being
here this evening. We have known -- since these
dates were distributed, we have known that
Alderman Burnett was not able to make this
meeting. He is in Humboldt Park convening and
facilitating a community meeting there, but I
appreciate her being here and also appreciate
and know we have his full support.
I stand here tonight to affirm
the commitment to excellence and also the
commitment of Jenner teachers as well as Ogden
teachers that I have had the privilege of
working with over the past three years that we
have been working on this effort. They have
been overly committed and seriously committed
most definitely to the children and to this
process.
One of the things that we have talked
about and we've discussed several times
throughout these three years is a quote from
Frederick Douglass that states, "It's better to
build strong children than to have to repair

broken adults."
And everyone that has been a part of
this process for the last three years has been
about that. Our commitment has been completely
and totally on the children who are here
currently and the children who will be here in
the future. If we can continue down that street
and stay on that avenue, I think that we will do
an excellent job, not only for these children
but also for this community.
Thank you very much.

MS. POPE: Good evening. My name is

years.
I have also been in this community
during the closing of schools, and I have seen
all the evolution demographically,
gentrification, changes over the years when I
have been living in Chicago. And I think with
this school it's a fabulous opportunity for
students to learn from each other, for parents
to learn from each other, for community members
to learn from each other.
Chicago is the most segregated major
city in the country and this is I would say a
very important opportunity for us to show that
it doesn't have to be that way. It doesn't have
to be economically segregated. It doesn't have

their adult peers.
My older daughter was the only white
kid in the (inaudible) when there's a variety of
students, and it has helped her to become a
fantastic person, comfortable with a wide range
of people.
That said -- and I am very supportive
of this merger -- I think it's really important

really important that we make sure that the
teachers all get the training that they need.
I think it's really important that we

that is, one of the teachers from Whitney Young

lines my entire life. And all I know is equity,
justice, civility, righteousness, freedom for
all of our young people, for all of our
families. I have the benefit and the blessing
of having a principal who I admire, trust, and
like. I have the benefit of having a -- I don't

hierarchy here, but Beyer.
I have to call whenever I have to take

heart and lay it bare. I say to you, If we're

It's critical that we bring to bear our
concerns, our issues, our fears, but that can't
stop us from doing the right thing but it's
always the right time to do the right thing, and
right now this is the right thing to do.
Because we do not write the future but
we must be included in what happens in our
community because this is our home. This is not
just about another school merger. There are
blood memories in these bricks, and I need you
all to pay reverence and respect to that as we

don't know if they were counting in that 5,000
number like the woman said earlier, but we got
families that will return to their homes and
they must be a part of this new reality.
I want to ask, what is the
administrative structure going to look like and
what is the capacity for teachers to be a part
of that transition team? It would be awful if
we just left that up to someone who doesn't know
us and they decide how we move about in our

basic capacity for families, parents, and kids
to be a part of the transition team.

slogan to be the N.E.S.T. It means to be
neighborly, to stay engaged, be scholarly, and
use teamwork, and I'm here to express support of

All of these elements of teamwork;
neighbors meeting each other, individuals using
their complementary skills and smarts have been
in action during these merger discussions.

you to CPS for being responsive to this
community to the input and ideas as we hopefully
drive towards the finish line for Ogden and
Jenner communities.
I want to highlight a few questions
that neighbors have presented to me about the
future. First, you talked a little bit at the
top of the meeting about the preschool. The
question is what's the status of the preschool
being offered? There are a number of little
ones from zero to four living in this
neighborhood. People have invested to stay in
the city and they are looking for preschool
choices.
The second question is, the current
high school assigned to this neighborhood is
Lincoln Park. Would a merger offer a
neighborhood choice for the families of
either Ogden or Lincoln Park or would the merger
change the assigned neighborhood's high school?
As a mother of two young girls, I am
happy to live in this Near North area that is
rich in culture, language, diversity, and
stories of generations from many different
backgrounds. We want to see CPS support the
merger and the ideas from the community.
Thank you.

MR. HULL: Hi. My name is Paul Hull,
H-u-l-l. I am an Ogden parent. Thank you for
giving us the opportunity to see the school.
It's a beautiful school. It's a new school.
It's great to finally have a chance to see it.
I come here neither for nor against but
merely a question to CPS itself for some data.
We definitely now have a plan. We see the plan
but no data to support it.
So we would ask if there is data to
support it, if you would provide it. Especially
with the four bullet points on the first page of
your proposal, we'd like to see the data that
actually supports the fact that, for both
schools' sake, that data will support the fact
that those goals will be achieved.
Will the $1.8 million over three years
be enough? What happens after the three years?
Is there money to support this program? I can't
imagine that three years is going to be enough
to make sure that everybody is protected, that
the goals are achieved for this now merged
school. What about data to support the fact
that, as mentioned before, the Title I funding
and Grades 6 through 8 who are given high school
funding will be taken away with the merger?
How does $1.8 million compare to that
funding over the term period? I also have some

data -- I was brought up a little bit before -as to capacity. With Cabrini-Green Development
Plan, that brings in 2300 units over the next
five years. We're looking at Goose Island being
developed, this area being developed. Is there
going to be enough space for now this largest
school district in Illinois to take on all the
students?
We have 810 capacity at Ogden East. I
think it's 690 here. With the plan it will be
810, so we'll be at capacity at Ogden, and 581
so there will be room, but will it be enough?
What happens if we go over?
Parlaying into the high school which
was also brought up, the high school functions
well but it's not a high school. It's an
elementary school converted. Is there any goal
to make a high school a much more well
functioning high school with size-appropriate
facilities, size-appropriate equipment? That is
not there yet.
With the influx of people, especially
with the people that are coming in, what will
happen with the high school? We've been hearing
about Wells being used instead of Ogden or both.
Is there any plan for the high school?
Thank you.

MR. ARNOLD: Hi. Michael Arnold,
A-r-n-o-l-d.
Someone made reference from the last
meeting, so maybe later on I'll respond, but
after the last meeting I asked a lot of
questions of CPS and I kind of hoped that you
would come back with some answers at this
meeting and show us.
For those who weren't here, I asked
what's in it for the people at Ogden? We're the
10th most diverse school out of 600 at CPS. We
have a great community that has been built up
over the last 20 years with Ogden.
The program plan says that the reason
this merger should happen and benefit Ogden is
that Ogden is overcrowded. The statement was
made that the population of Ogden is much
different than it is today and it's not
overcrowded.
To that, I guess hearing a lot of
comments, the first thing that came to my mind
before I walked up here and the thought went
through my mind is there is so much pain in the
Jenner community. People have talked about
Martin Luther King and racism and segregation
and unfair boundaries. I think I'm for the kids
and I'm for what most people want to do.
Alderman Burnett has been in from the

beginning on this, but you can't be honest if
you're in the Jenner community and say that
you're not being deliberate on those things.
We're standing in one of CPS's wealthiest school
districts and there is no wealthy kids that go
to school here. We are standing in one of the
most white boundaries in all of CPS.
According to CPS's website, there is no
white kids that go to school here. (Inaudible)
skeptical or against this merger had some issues
with race, and I don't think that that's fair to
say about the people at Ogden. It's the tenth
most diverse school. So many of us love that
diversity and celebrate it.
If you think your school isn't good,
call Dr. Beyer. He talked to people from all
over the community just because they ask.
(Inaudible) some committee of 18 people that
only has one parent from Jenner on it to tell
you what's best for your kids. You don't need
(inaudible) parents at CPS to tell you what is
best for your kid.
You're a member of your own community
and you can ask why are we failing? The
teacher (inaudible) provocative statements.
Thank you so much for listening to me. We only
had three people speak against it and apparently
no one else wants to speak. So the first thing

concerned to know if -- will the children at
Jenner have to leave if Ogden merger is the end
of them because they don't live in the area?
Oh, yeah. And I would like for him to please
keep his teacher.
The teachers here at Jenner are just -I love them. He has been here ever since he was
in kindergarten and sometimes he's good and
sometimes he is not and they know it. So I want
him to keep those teachers. He will be coming
out next year so I just -- I'm concerned about

Other than that, I think the merger is

children, parents, and everybody to learn how to
negotiate with each other, get along with each
other. They'll learn how to do that and they
need that. So okay. Thank you.

give him his call. He got the call and they
said, Mr. Croston, you expressed concern about a
community and we want to offer you the school
that you applied for. We have another school
that needs a principal and we want to know if
you want to go there or if you would consider
going there.
And he said, I want to be in the place
that's right for me.
And so he came here to Jenner. We live
far, far, far away on the south side and he
would commute, probably about an hour in traffic
every day and he loved this place. He was
passionate about the work that was being done in
this community to merge Jenner and Ogden.
And I thought it is a great joy to know
that the community actually continues to process
and do this work and to try to make this merger
come to life. It's hard work, but you all
haven't given up on trying to figure out how to
make this work.
So Rob had also come here and he began
to transform this school Climate and Culture.
He brought the N.E.S.T. He wanted his students
to know how to be neighborly, how to stay
engaged with school, how to be scholarly, and
how to use teamwork. And I really do want to
say to Principal Croston, thank you.

and community for continuing to be neighborly,
to stay engaged, to be scholarly and use
teamwork to bring this merger together. So I
thank you. I know it's hard work and you are
blessed, and as Rob continues to fight for his
life, I just pray that we all will do the right
thing in this community and work together and do
what is right for the children at Jenner as well
as Ogden.
So I thank you.

a nine month old, and I'd like to express my
support for this merger.
I understand that there are concerns
and there are challenges with the merger, but I
personally believe that anything can be solved
if we come together as a community and put our
minds together and work on this together. I'm
personally excited about the merger. I'm
looking forward to sending my kids to a
community school and not having to drive them to
somewhere.
It's something that when we moved into

the community, I was excited to have a school
right across the street. And we made that
decision. We moved in here. We knew it was
going to be Jenner, but now it could be Ogden
and Jenner.
So I'm really hoping for that too. I
personally went to a CPS school myself during my
elementary years and I went to I would say a
diversified school, and I really appreciate the
opportunity I had going to a CPS school. I also
went to Northwestern which is a little bit
different, and coming from that background
really helped me I think blossom as a person,
and I want the same thing for my children as
well as the children in the community.
I want to say thank you to everyone who
has worked so hard on this. I think just
watching this over the past three years -Teresa who spoke earlier has been keeping me
updated. And I really, really appreciate all
the work that has been going into this to make
this happen because at the end of the day it is
for our kids and it is for the betterment of the
community.
I also thank CPS for working on this
opportunity. Like I said, I know a lot of our
neighbors are looking forward to this, and I
wanted to make sure that it's coming across

MS. WHEELER: Hello. My name is Sharon
Wheeler, S-h-a-r-o-n W-h-e-e-l-e-r. I am a
community member.
I lived in this community for 23 plus
years and I'm also program manager for the Near
North Unity Program, and I have the great honor
to be a member of the Steering Committee for the
Jenner-Ogden merger.
I'm going to go back to the
organization that I work for, Near North Unity
Program, and unity is our goal. It's a lofty
goal, but it's what we want for our community.
And I'm going to read -- if I can get my iPhone
to work -- a quote from Thurgood Marshall that
says, "Unless our children begin to learn
together, there is little hope that our people
will ever begin to live together," and that's
Thurgood Marshall.

I just want to say that I have heard a

the merger, which I want to state for the record
that I am for the merger.
But the comments that were against, the
people that stated concerns, it seems they came
out of fear, and decisions made from fear are
never good decisions. We need to move forward
making our decisions of hope and of courage, so
I thank everyone, and again it's for the kids.
Thank you.

MS. DRECZYNSKI: Good evening,
everyone. My name is Michele Dreczynski,
M-i-c-h-e-l-e D-r-e-c-z-y-n-s-k-i.
I am here today once again to formally
state my support for the proposed campus sharing
merger of the Jenner and Ogden schools. I've
been publicly testifying at CPS hearings since
2013 and I have been writing letters to CPS
about missed opportunities at my neighborhood
school here, Jenner, since J.C. Brizard was in
office, and that was a long time ago.
For far too long the Near North side
was divided by political forces that designated
housing choices through misdirected policy that
sought to segregate people rather than unite
them. The segregationist housing policy that

created Cabrini-Green also helped to create and
maintain neighborhood CPS schools in this area
that were racially segregated, as the housing
is.
Jenner is one of the remaining two
schools in this area that has a legacy of
segregation. It is time to recognize this
legacy of segregation that has caused immense
disparity in school access and come to an end,
have it come to an end. Please allow students
at Jenner the same access to high quality IB
education that other children on the Near North
side enjoy just seven blocks away.
Go over there and look at the Ogden
school, look at the Jenner school. There are
amazing kids at both facilities and I implore
you to give all the kids equal access to the
same type of education.
Thank you very much.

Now the opportunity for that to stop
and it's a golden opportunity, and I hope that
this will possibly go through but -- sorry.
So it should go through. Frederick
Douglass one said, "Without a struggle, there
will be no progress."
This started in 2013 apparently or some
other time I do not remember by somebody I'm not
familiar with. So this could have been a -- not
turned out the best because another way is we
wouldn't been here, and I think it's not fair
for kids exactly like me to not get the same
education as people at a different school.
So I hope one day this can be a
perfectly legitimate school. Sorry. And I mean
like -- and I hope one day this will be maybe
possibly one of the most terrific schools in the
entire City of Chicago.
Thank you.

MS. SEDA GONZALEZ: Last September I
was just a girl at Walter Payton, three blocks
away from Jenner, four blocks away from Ogden,
with no idea this merger was happening. Then I
read an article, and I became inspired at the
possibility that somebody had the courage to
support an idea like this.
Then I researched and found out CPS is
only 9 percent white and 84 percent low income,
and I became astonished that those are the
numbers, but then at the top-performing schools
at CPS, it skewed completely differently.
What's happening to the rest of the
kids? And this merger, I do want to reiterate
my complete support for it, but this is only the
first step for our Chicago. We are in the most
segregated city in America and this is only the
first step. There is still that other 84
percent low-income students, 91 percent students
of color that this merger is not going to
encompass, and we need to make sure that
equitable education is available for all.

speaker that I don't think is here anymore, but
she said that because we are expanding this
boundary to be possibly the biggest boundary in
our city, this is not going to be a community
school anymore. And I don't know what the word
community means to you, but to me it means
encompassing everyone in our neighborhood, in
our Near North community, and that is kids from
Ogden, that is kids from Jenner, that is kids
who in 2011 when Cabrini-Green shut down were
forced to relocate and leave their homes.
That is kids from families that want to
come and move into this area because they see it
as an opportunity for a diverse education. This
school, the merger, if it happens -- which I
really am hoping it will -- will be the epitome
of a community and will set a powerful precedent
for our Chicago, especially in the context of
all the hate and bad sentiments that are going
on in our country. Thank you.

plan makes specific reference to the use of
outside organizations to help support the
school, so I wanted to speak as one of those
outside organizations.
My fellow volunteers and I over the
years have served as one-on-one reading tutors.
We've acted as classroom aides. We've
chaperoned field trips, mentored older students,
read books with the youngest ones. We've given
music lessons. We've led a public speaking
workshop, and we've even taught the kids to
knit.
We've welcomed fathers on the first day
of school as part of the Million Father March.
We've shared our stories with students on Career
Day. We sponsored a daddy-daughter dance that's
celebrated with the parents of graduating 8th
graders.
We are only one of many, many
organizations that care deeply about this
community. There is a long list of partners
that have been there and will continue to be
there to provide support to a consolidated
school. We appreciate that this merger offers
both the Jenner and Ogden students a real chance
to have an inclusive, equitable, and quality
education.
We know that all students benefit from

being part of a racially and economically

that achievement rises across the board for all
sets of students when there is this kind of
learning environment. And all of us -students, parents, and teachers -- are enriched
by interacting and learning with and from people
with different perspectives and experiences.
I applaud CPS for taking the
opportunity to elevate both schools by bringing
these two opportunities together, and I urge
that it does so by meaningfully honoring the
rich history, culture, traditions, and
programming of both schools. This is a chance
to bring together what is the best for each of
these special places and to create something
truly incredible that will enhance the lives of
all members of this joint community, and I want

and my daughter. In the years that I was there
I was around many, many different backgrounds of
family. You have Hispanics, Caucasians, blacks,
Asians, Indians. Many, many, different ethnics
of families. We were eating bread together. We
was having fun together. We was just enjoying
all type of activities together.
What I don't understand is why is it an
issue when it comes to education for Jenner and
Ogden? Why is it an issue for our children to
merge together for the schools but not when
you're in a bad situation, when you're sick,
when someone is in a life-or-death situation?
It's okay for all of us to come
together when you're in need, because when
you're sick, when your child is sick, you're in
need. You become poor. No one is rich when
you're about to die. No one is rich when you
have to go to the hospital and stay in a
hospital for years and years at a time because
they can't diagnose you or they can't help you
or your child.
We all are in the same situation. So
we all experience it and it's okay for us to be
together. It's okay.

We told -- so thank you, Dr. Carson,
for letting my daughter come back from the west
side. We traveled back to Jenner because this
is my neighborhood home. I could have chose
Ogden. They would have let me in, but I wanted
to come back to Jenner because Jenner is full of
love.
Jenner is a family. And furthermore,
we are rich. Every one of our children in this

who is trying to get this merger together. That

So I invite everyone out to that speech

Everyone is welcome.
Along those lines, we met with a group
of parents from Ogden and Jenner and teachers
from Ogden and Jenner right before this meeting.
We are planning some potlucks, monthly potlucks

I'm fully confident knowing Ogden

still have disagreements but we will all still

was in the back of my mind and I couldn't stop

education? And for me that's completely the
opposite of what this merger is about.
It's about mutual enrichment from both
communities because that's what a merger is.

emotion in the mind. Okay? So we can control
what we choose to control in our minds. And,
therefore, it will manifest on the outside. I'm
on the Steering Committee because I like to
control what happens in my community and in my
environment.
So I have heard a lot of undertone of
racism. Over the years I have done workshops on
diversity training and just plain old
in-your-face awareness of racism. I heard that
here tonight. There wasn't racial slurs used,
but the undertone was there. Why don't you stay
over there and we'll stay over here pretty much
is what was said when it was summed up.
But I also learned over the years in my
teaching that love, love is what is going to win
all. Now, love comes in many forms and many
different fashions. Love isn't always nice and
kind and sweet, and love is sometimes very stern
and very direct.
So I will directly say to those parents
who have fears, please don't take those fears
back home and plant them into your children.
Leave them in your own head and go get some
therapy or something for that. That is a
disease that actually needs to be purged.
I am sick and tired of tiptoeing
around. We will love you, sir, out of your fear

and we will love your children as well. But I
will not look away. You can cease to use your
undertone racism. I love you. Have a nice day.
(Applause.)
MR. METCALF: We had one additional
person who signed up.
MS. SHERIFF: Hi. My name is Deborah
Sheriff, D-e-b-o-r-a-h S-h-e-r-i-f-f.
I am a 1st grade teacher here at Jenner
and I have had the privilege of working
with (inaudible) at Ogden. Our classrooms have
been on multiple field trips over the past two
years, and working with six year olds, they are
pure of heart.
So I'm going to end with love because
the 1st graders, the first time we went on the
field trip together the museum had all kinds of
activities planned for them to get to know each
other. There was a hill, and that's all they
needed. And they did a phenomenal job at the
meeting talking about art and then playing
together after talking about art.
This year we did the same thing, and
they did a phenomenal job. The groups were
intermixed. You couldn't tell who was a Jenner
student and who was an Ogden student.
Also, after the last meeting, we came
back to school on Wednesday morning, and my 1st

graders had all kinds of questions. Are we
going to have to go to a new school? Do we have
to have new teachers? Are we going to have the
same friends?
One of my students transferred to Ogden
earlier in the year. When I said, "Brooklyn
will be there," that was all it took. Yay,
we're back together again.
So I think that you can think of this
as far as how the children look at it and it's
not any different from the kindergartners up to
the 8th graders. Kids are kids.
The teachers are all good teachers, and
whether it's -- no matter what school they are.
So I am in favor of the merger.
(Applause.)
MR. METCALF: So we are at the end of
the hour, but I want to be fair and give anyone
that has not came up, but we are at the end of
the hour.
Please keep in mind that there are
folks at the registration table that can answer
specific questions around student transitions,
social and emotional learning.
The public hearing is January 25th from
4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. at CPS's office, and the
address is 42 West Madison Street.
