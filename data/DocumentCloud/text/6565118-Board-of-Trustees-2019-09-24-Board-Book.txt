Public Comment:
There was no public comment.
Report of the Executive Director:
Executive Director Feldman mentioned the article in Sunday’s Plain Dealer and thanked everyone
present who had a hand in delivering the work on the buildings and commended Director Rich for making
the article happen in exactly the right way.
Executive Director Feldman mentioned we received another clean audit and we will receive the Auditor
Award of Distinction, the highest honor they give. Congratulations to the Finance team for their hard work
and contributions and pass along our congratulations to Assistant Finance Director Dolan who was not
present.
Executive Director Feldman mentioned the great work done on our Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report (CAFER) and again, we expect to be recognized for the work on that report.
Executive Director Feldman mentioned it has been our practice to notify the Board about donations. We
have made a significant donation of 193 old laptops to an organization called PC’s for People. This
organization is where our own customers can gain access to an inexpensive PC that will enable them to
be online using either the wireless in our buildings, wireless hot spots they can borrow from certain
branches or wireless hotspots they can borrow through our Google grant program. We are pleased to
donate these laptops that will be refurbished and sold at almost no cost back into the community. This is
a not-for-profit organization that is connected with The Cleveland Foundation.
Human Resources Report:
Acting Director Miller stated as part of our ongoing efforts to develop our Branch Managers, and to
provide them different experiences in different communities, the decision was made to exchange three of
our Branch Managers among locations. We have recently transferred Branch Managers at Parma,
Brooklyn, and Middleburg Heights Branches. He mentioned that some of the Pages took on higher level
positions and the Page position continues to be an important talent pipeline for us.
04-07/2019
Trustee Leonard moved approval, seconded by Trustee DePiero. Seeing no discussion, the Human
Resources Report dated July 23, 2019, was approved as presented by unanimous vote of the Board
members present. (See pages 197-203)
Finance Committee Report:
Finance Committee Chair Leonard reminded us that the Finance Committee met prior to the Board
meeting, and Director Morgan gave an in-depth review of the financials.
Director Morgan gave highlights from the Finance report. He stated in general property taxes we received
a very small amount for the first half of the year settlement. With this distribution we are on budget.
Director Morgan stated we received a larger distribution for the Public Library Fund (PLF) in the month of
June than last year. The collections moving forward should also be slightly larger to bring us back to
budget. With this larger distribution we are on budget. We will continue to monitor this account. The
Governor’s budget impacted the PLF. For the month of July, the amount we received was reverted back
to the original legislation of 1.66%, but the biennium budget has passed at 1.7%. There was an
amendment made that we would get that amount made up to us for the month of July. We don’t know
when we will receive that distribution, but we will be made whole for the month of July at the 1.7%, and
the 1.7% is what we will receive for the next biennium. Director Morgan stated will give more information
next month on where that revenue number will be.
Trustee Varley asked Assistant Director Marnecheck to give CCPL Board members Senator Matt Dolan’s
contact information. As Chair of Finance, he was one of the advocates for the change for the 1.7%
increase. It was significant, in terms of the increase and we would like to send him a note.

192   P a g e

Executive Director Feldman commented Senator Dolan remembered to make Libraries whole and to have
the 1.7% be retroactive back to when the budget should have passed.
Director Morgan stated interest rates are higher than anticipated and the larger increase has brought in
additional revenue. Based on some of our recent maturities we are beginning to see some of those
increases leveling off.
Director Morgan stated patron fines and fees are exceeding our estimates due to passport fees and
photos. Sale of resale supplies are also slightly exceeding our estimates.
Director Morgan stated in the month of May we had three payrolls posted in the salaries account. It is
showing a slight increase over budget, but for the month of June we are back on budget.
All other accounts are where we expect them to be for the month and year.
(See under FINANCE)
Investments - June
Director Morgan stated we purchased one new investment from Toronto Dominion Securities with a yield
of 2.44% and a four-month maturity. We also purchased a CD from Multi-Bank Securities/Ally Bk Midvale
with a yield of 2.50% and a three-year maturity.
Transfers
Director Morgan stated there was one transfer made for the month in the amount of $71,400.00 from the
general fund to the Adult Education Services (ASPIRE) fund for the Library match.
(See under FINANCE)

Yea: Edward H. Blakemore; Allyn Davies; Dean E. DePiero; William J.
Leonard; Patricia A. Shlonsky; Maria L. Spangler; Robert W. Varley; – 7.

Purchase Approval List
Director Morgan stated the Purchase Approval List (PAL) was reviewed in depth at the Finance
Committee Meeting. Director Morgan gave highlights of the PAL.
Director Morgan stated item #1 is an encumbrance increase for Roetzel & Andress LPA needed for
construction legal services. Item #2 is a renewal purchase for Communico software used for scheduling
events and meeting rooms system wide. Item #3 is for a grant purchase for Elsie Day consulting services.
Item #4 is for the purchase of charging cables to offer for sale to customers in branches. We are
purchasing 5,000 and will sell them at $4.00 each. Item #5 is the fee for Security Risk Management
Consultants for system wide safety and security assessment.
President Shlonsky ask Facilities Director Mori to explain Item #5 to the Board.
Facilities Director Mori stated we are requesting approval to contract with Security Risk Management
Consultants (SRMC) for a vulnerability assessment which has to do with physical security of buildings and
grounds. This is not a cybersecurity assessment. SRMC will be tasked with providing an overarching
vulnerability reduction plan along with an individual assessment for each of our specific branch
locations. The assessment will be utilized to create a 5-year security master plan, with prioritized items
that can be funded over multiple fiscal periods.

Resolution Authorizing the Library to Enter into an Agreement with Donley’s Inc. for
Construction Management at Risk Services Relating to the New Construction of the
Bay Village located in the City of Bay Village
Director Morgan stated there are two contracts attached. The first is the general conditions contract and
the second is the actual contract with Donley’s Inc. This is the same CMR contract we used for CCPL
Middleburg Heights Branch, and it has been fully vetted by legal counsel. We made modifications as
counsel recommended, we feel it is a good contract rate and we are asking the Board for approval.
President Shlonsky asked how did we decide on Donley’s Inc?
Director Morgan stated we send out a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to construction management
companies and they respond. We score those RFQ’s and then we rank them and call those companies
that scored high enough for interviews. Based on those interviews, we bring a ranking to the Board of 1,
2 and 3 of our choice of whom we would like to use, and Donley’s was our first choice. Donley’s Inc. has
also done work on our CCPL Parma-Snow Branch.
Trustee Blakemore asked where do we stand with CCPL Bay Village Branch and the progress?
Deputy Director Strobel stated we are taking our plan to our first meeting with the Architectural Board
Review (ABR) and the Planning Commission on August 7. We presented it to Mayor Koomar and his
Library Committee two weeks ago for their preview, we received a positive response and we are
confident that it will be well received.
08-07/2019
Trustee DePiero moved approval, seconded by Trustee Varley. Seeing no additional discussion, the
Resolution Authorizing the Library to enter into an Agreement with Donley’s Inc. for Construction
Management at Risk Services Relating to the New Construction of the Bay Village located in the City of
Bay Village was approved by unanimous vote of the Board members present. (See pages 206-269)
Executive Director Remarks:
Executive Director Feldman stated she has so much to be grateful for and so many people to thank, her
colleagues, the customers, the Foundation Board, our government officials and our funders. She gave a
heartfelt presentation about the first Trustees who gave her a seat at this table and the current Trustees
who have picked her most talented successor. She stated she is incredibly moved by the opportunities
given, the collaboration, the achievements, the friendship and the rewards of serving at the Cuyahoga
County Public Library. More than 16 years ago, she would have never anticipated the professional joy
and satisfaction that our service together would achieve for all communities in Cuyahoga County. She
stated she is truly the luckiest Librarian & Library Director. She asked our Trustees past and present to
stand and asked everyone present to join her in giving our Boards a standing ovation.
Former Trustee Dale Powers spoke briefly about Sari Feldman.

members of CCPL Board of Trustees. They reflected on the past 16 years and Sari’s accomplishments
and the phenomenal variety of programs that were implemented under her leadership that provided much

CCPL, as President of the Public Library Association and then as President of the American Library
Association as well as CCPL as a 5-star library for the past 10 years. Because of her extraordinary

A MESSAGE FROM OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
NEW OPPORTUNITIES
I am honored and excited to be the new executive director of Cuyahoga
County Public Library (CCPL). For the past 14 years it has been a privilege
to work side by side with former executive director Sari Feldman as
CCPL’s deputy director. I am grateful for her years of mentorship and
proud of all that we accomplished together. Sari has left behind an
incredible legacy of excellence and innovation. I am eager to work
together with our library staff to continue that legacy and explore new
opportunities to serve our customers and communities.
Having grown up and lived in Northeast Ohio most of my life, I bring an
appreciation for the nuances of each of the 47 communities we serve. I
am excited to combine that knowledge with my expertise in the breadth
of services and resources CCPL offers to set a course for the library
system that will raise our standard of excellence even higher. Library
staff members at our 27 branches and the administrative headquarters
are all focused on
exceeding your expectations, and I am grateful for and proud of the
work they do every day to serve you.
Speaking of which … with a new school year upon us, our efforts to
serve the needs of students are in full gear. This September, we’ll kick
off our 17th season of Homework Centers, the after-school homework
assistance program begun by our Maple Heights Branch staff back in
2002 to help students improve their grades. The success of their local
efforts eventually led to the expansion of the program to 10 branches
throughout the county. Today we can proudly say that our Homework
Centers have helped thousands of students in grades K – 8 improve
their grades and subject comprehension.
Homework Centers is our longest-running out-of-school time program,
but in recent years we have introduced many others, including a
collaboration with the Greater Cleveland Food Bank to provide free
healthy meals to students in communities where the need is great,
kindergarten readiness clubs and an early childhood literacy program
called 1-2-3 READ that helps struggling readers meet Ohio’s Third
Grade Reading Guarantee. We have also added a Homework Mentors
program at eight branches to increase students’ access to free homework
assistance. These and many other opportunities await students and their
families at CCPL this school year.
We have so many great programs that it’s easy to lose sight of the fact
that some of the most impactful work our library staff does for students
happens spontaneously. It could be helping them pick the right book
for a book report, or showing them a helpful resource or giving them
a snack because they’re hungry. These little moments can make a big
difference. They give students – and their parents – peace of mind that
the library is a place they can turn for help from caring adults who want
to see them succeed.
Sincerely,

Tracy Strobel
Executive Director

My library, the @CuyahogaLib, has checked out/does check out those big wooden puzzles for kids.
They also have a recording booth for aspiring musicians, a writer’s room with monthly workshops,
and the means to get a passport. My library is AWESOME!
@PattyMarvel, August 27, 2019

August was an especially busy month for the Processing Department (PRO). Staff processed 12 percent more
items than in August of 2018.
Twenty-four foodies ﬂocked to the South Euclid-Lyndhurst Branch on August 14 to learn culinary skills from
Catherine St. John of the Western Reserve School of Cooking. Customers enjoyed an introduction to Middle
Eastern cooking. Spiced cauliﬂower, pita chip salad and baba ghanoush were among some of the samples
prepared on site.
During the daily Boredom Busters program at the Maple Heights Branch, customers explored the science of
space, building with LEGOs and technology through a variety of hands-on learning experiences including
collaborative games, building challenges and science experiments. Participants also expressed their creativity
through sculpture, Perler beads, painting, shaving cream play, origami and drawing. Over the course of the
summer, 257 individuals participated.
The Gates Mills Branch hosted 31 Nature Camp students for a program about creating stop-motion animation
using iPads and the Bloxels app. Three even created their own video games. When the teens’ moms arrived to
pick them up, they didn’t want to leave.
Grandparents Day came early at the Chagrin Falls Branch on August 28. Staff led an intergenerational group
of 23 participants through stories, crafts and several rounds of Bingo. Instamatic photos were taken of children
and their caregivers for the picture frame craft. Everyone went home with two pictures and decorated picture
frames, as well as a grandparent’s interview sheet and a Bingo prize.
During the week of August 19, the Mayﬁeld Branch circulation staff prepared 300 new cards for 7th graders
at Mayﬁeld Middle School. On Friday, August 23, more than 350 students and teachers arrived to pick up
their cards and browse the collection. Reference staff helped students make their choices while circulation staff
worked with people who had issues with their cards or needed help checking out. As the students were leaving
one of their teachers said, “Same time next year!”

Maria Trivisonno from the Mayﬁeld and Richmond Heights branches attended the Richmond Heights Schools’
Board of Education meeting on Monday, August 12. The Board announced that they have accepted and were
pleased with the Library’s plans for the new Richmond Branch to be attached to the upper school. The children’s
area will feature artwork from the book Windﬂyers written by Angela Johnson and illustrated by Loren Long,
both Ohio natives. The book, about Tuskagee Airmen, will correspond to the new aviation program the school
is developing, and the neighboring airport.
Twenty-six readers attended two Solon Branch book groups in August to discuss Anne Youngson’s beautiful little
gem, Meet Me at the Museum, led by Carol Ward. Customers were treated to one PowerPoint presentation that
Carol created, followed by a diverse conversation on the many topics covered in the book. The highlight of the
discussions occurred Tuesday morning where Carol arranged for the author to join the senior center discussion
via live video chat from Oxfordshire, England!
The community’s response this year to the Southeast Branch Friends’ Annual Ice Cream Social was amazing!
About 250 people came to the branch to enjoy a sundae made with Mitchell’s Ice Cream and to see a magic
show by Elie the Magician. The Friends group uses this event as way to promote the Southeast Branch in the
community as well as an opportunity to drum up new members.
The Independence Branch hosted an All-Star Photo-Op on July 1 to gear up for the MLB All-Star Game.
Twenty-two people enjoyed having their picture taken in front of the green screen, then seeing Progressive
Field “magically” appear in the picture.
A ladder for ants to climb, a bird’s nest with toys in it and a boat to cross a lava lake are just a few of the creative
designs engineered by a group of 13 students at the Brecksville Branch. On August 3, staff member Lynne White
also facilitated a Mystery Bag Challenge for kids. Each participant was given a challenge card and a bag of
supplies including items such as egg cartons, pipe cleaners, paper plates, rubber bands and more, and were
instructed to build a solution to the challenge.
A Garﬁeld Heights Branch customer was tickled pink to have her nephew – who recently moved to the area

Commons event.
More than 200 customers brought their lawn chairs and enjoyed the Middleburg Heights Branch’s hugely

book with WorkKeys practice tests to move onto the next part of her training as a nurse. Liza found resources

Financial Statement Analysis
August 2019

Revenues
For General Property Taxes we received what will be our settlement for the second half
of the year. We may see some much smaller amounts come in for the remainder of the
year. With this settlement we have exceeded our estimate for the year by $776,746.
Our August distribution for the PLF was larger than what we received last year. With
this distribution we are back on budget. We have also received a revised estimate for
the 2019 PLF from the state and that estimate is a little over $377,000 than what we
originally budgeted. This is for increased collections as well as the slight increase in the
percentage that libraries received as part of the new biennium budget from the state
that began in July.
If that estimate is correct, the increased amount along with the increase in our budget
for General Property Taxes will fund our $1,000,000 carryover budgeted for 2020.
Interest is also exceeding our original estimates. The larger increase in rates than
expected has brought in additional revenue. Based on some of our recent maturities we
are beginning to see some of those increases leveling off.
Patron Fines and Fees in total are currently exceeding our estimates. Once again it is
passport fees and photos which are the reason for the increase. Sale of Resale
Supplies is also slightly exceeding our estimates.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
the year.

Expenses
Expenses for Salaries and Benefits are right in budget for the month of August.
accounts.
Many of the other expense accounts have higher than expected percentages for
expenses and encumbrances because many of these accounts have standing orders
encumbered against them to pay monthly and recurring expenses.
All other General Fund expense accounts are where we would expect them to be for the
month and the year.
In the Capital Fund projects the final expenses for the Maple Heights renovation were
paid. The only projects open are the Bay Village and Richmond Heights Branches.

 39

Investments
We had no investment maturities in the month of August. Just the usual activity in the
Money Market funds.

Transfers
There were no transfers or advances for the month.

Cuyahoga County Public Library
Resolution Calling for Macmillan Publishing to Reverse Library
Ebook Embargo

WHEREAS, public libraries hold free and open access to books, information and ideas
as a foundational value; and,

WHEREAS, Cuyahoga County Public Library has more than 808,761 cardholders, and,
in 2018, recorded 2,133,687 million checkouts of eBooks and eAudiobooks; and,
WHEREAS, on July 25, 2019 Macmillan Publishing (Macmillan) announced it would
become the only major publisher to limit eBook lending for U.S. libraries under a new licensing
model scheduled to begin November 1, 2019; and,
WHEREAS, Macmillan’s proposed model restricts public libraries – regardless of size
or population served – to the purchase of only one single copy of a new title in eBook format
upon its publication release, after which the publisher will impose an eight-week embargo on
additional copies of that title sold to libraries; and,
WHEREAS, Macmillan’s new model for library eBook lending will make it difficult for
libraries to fulfill our central mission of ensuring access to information for all.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Cuyahoga County Public Library
Board of Trustees joins the American Library Association (ALA) in denouncing this measure and
calling for Macmillan Publishing to cancel the embargo and restore full access to its complete
eBook catalog upon release to the public.
FURTHERMORE, the Cuyahoga County Public Library Board of Trustees affirms the
principles that:
 All published works must be available for libraries to purchase and lend to library customers.
 Access to and use of eBooks must equitably balance the rights and privileges of readers,
authors and publishers.
 Digital content must be accessible to all people, regardless of physical or reading
disabilities.
 Reading records must remain private in the digital age.
