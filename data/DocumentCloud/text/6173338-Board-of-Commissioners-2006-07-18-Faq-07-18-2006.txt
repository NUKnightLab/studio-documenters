Question/Comment

Status

Highlighted Security Initiatives for Altgeld.

Comments Noted.

Acknowledged CHA staff for working with her and
the residents at ABLA.
Will the 140 acres that Altgeld Murray sits on will it
be sold, has anybody expressed an interest in
purchasing it.

Comments Noted.

Would like to know why her rent is $900/month.

Rent concern has been addressed and resolved by the
Management Office.

Per the Chair, in 1999 the Board established a policy that CHA
will not sell its land, since it is considered the Authorityâ€™s long
term assets. The only instances when land will be sold is in
Mixed Income communities where CHA is building town-homes,
and that land is being sold to homeowners, otherwise in
rehabbed community, land remains with CHA. In other MixedIncome communities the land is leased to Developers.
Therefore, land will not be sold at Altgeld since Altgeld is being
rehabilitated not redeveloped.
