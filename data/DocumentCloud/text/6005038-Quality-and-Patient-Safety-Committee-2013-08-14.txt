Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation (Attachment #1)
Dr. Krishna Das, System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation, presented her report,
which included information on the following subjects: overview of regulations guiding hospital quality efforts;
updated survey information; and overview of publicly reported metrics. The Committee reviewed and discussed
the information.
Chairman Collens inquired regarding the aggregate rate of 72% of 107 patients under the measure of Initial
Antibiotic Selection for CAP in Immunocompetent Patient, which was reflected in the Hospital Compare Report
- Fourth Quarter 2011 through Third Quarter 2012 Discharges (included in Attachment #1). Dr. Das responded
that this is a question on antibiotic selection. This is one of the more controversial guidelines provided by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS has been criticized because, especially several years
ago, not every guideline was entirely evidence-based; CMS is very actively in the process of revising these
guidelines. The antibiotic guideline is one of those guidelines where they recommend sort of a “one size fits
all” antibiotic treatment regimen for all patients with pneumonia. Upon review of the System’s internal data, it
was found that these regimens are perhaps not optimal for the System’s patients; staff tries to base antibiotic
therapy based on the local disease prevalence and the antibiotic sensitivities.

Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation (continued)
Director Lerner noted that, as the System moves more toward managing a population’s health, it needs to move
more away from an inpatient orientation towards measuring and monitoring quality, to something that’s much
broader than that; under the leadership of Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, the Committee should take
some time to talk about that at a future time.
Earlier in the meeting, Director Gugenheim had inquired regarding the definition of “patient-centered”; the
response had been that patient-centered care involves treating the patient with respect and incorporating the
patient into the decision-making process with respect to their care. Director Lerner stated that, nowadays, health
systems are including humanity and kindness in their definition of patient-centered care; this is not typically
what one would think about when they think about patient-centered improvements, so how the System builds
the humanity and kindness into its measures is critical. Additionally, he stated that none of these measures
engage the individual, and the individual’s responsibility for their own care, or what he likes to call the coobligation - the obligation of the individual to the System, and the System to the individual. As the System
moves toward managing the population, there needs to be thought given to something different, in terms of
outcome.

IV.

Action Items
A. Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, July 10, 2013
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to accept the Minutes of the
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of July 10, 2013. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. **Medical Staff Appointments/Re-appointments/Changes (Attachment #2)
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to approve the Medical Staff
Appointments/Reappointments/Changes. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Sections IV, V and VI
D. Proposed revisions to the Bylaws of the Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of Cook County
(Attachment #3)
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
presented the item for the Committee’s consideration, and provided an overview of the proposed revisions.
Dr. Aaron Hamb, Medical Director of Provident Hospital of Cook County, provided additional information.
Director Lerner expressed concerns with the proposed revisions to Section 12.01.B., regarding voting by
proxy. He stated that he was uncomfortable with allowing a proxy vote when someone is not present to
vote themselves. This proposed change allows for an accumulation of proxy votes by a single individual or
single group, and they could vote a bloc. He indicated that he was sure the intent for this proposed revision
was in the event that an individual has an untoward event and they want to have their voice heard; however,
this revision does not say that the individual votes, and then that vote is cast by someone else - this revision
says that the individual is going to have someone vote their proxy. If this had been written as simply
allowing another member to cast a written vote on behalf of the active member, he would not have had as
much of an issue; under that scenario, the individual is not giving away their right to vote to someone else.

Action Items
D. Proposed revisions to the Bylaws of the Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of Cook County
(continued)
Dr. Wakim stated that this issue surfaced during the elections of officers; many of the physicians were on
duty in the evenings in clinics and were unable to vote. He indicated that the intent was to have the proxy
vote cast in the active member’s wishes.
Following discussion, the Committee determined that a motion to approve the proposed revisions, with the
exception of the revision proposed in Section 12.01.B. regarding proxy votes, would be in order. Chairman
Collens added that there are provisions that are typically included in corporate bylaws that provide for
unanimous written consent on certain key issues, which is the direction that he believed Director Lerner was
discussing; he recommended that Dr. Wakim also consider this, when drafting proposed revisions to the
Bylaws regarding voting by proxy.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to approve the proposed revisions
to the Bylaws of the Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of Cook County, with the
exception of the revision proposed in Section 12.01.B. regarding voting by proxy. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

V.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Discussion of 2013 Meeting schedule and planning for schedule of 2014 Committee Meetings
Following discussion, the Committee determined that the schedule of remaining 2013 Quality and Patient
Safety Committee Meetings does not require any adjustments at this time.
With regard to planning for the schedule of 2014 Committee Meetings, the consensus reached by the
Committee indicated that they were in favor of holding the Committee Meetings and Board Meeting on
the same day.

B. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Wakim presented his report from the EMS of Provident Hospital of Cook County. He stated that the
EMS met last Friday. There were discussions held regarding outpatient services that are provided at
Provident Hospital, and regarding physician accountability - the ways and manners for all of the physicians
to make sure that they are responsible and accountable for their County time. The Bylaws and proposed
revisions that were presented today were discussed. There was a discussion regarding about the Bud
Billiken Parade, which took place on August 10th. Dr. Wakim added that the 20th Anniversary of Provident
Hospital will soon take place; he anticipates that it will be celebrated in December.
Dr. Ozuru Ukoha, President of the EMS of Stroger Hospital of Cook County, stated that the EMS did not
recently meet; therefore, he had no report to present at this time.

approve an urgent amendment without prior notification of the OMS. In such cases the OMS will
be immediately notified by the MEC through its President. The OMS will have the opportunity to
retrospectively review and comment on the provisional amendment. If there is no conflict between
the MEC and the OMS the provisional amendment stands. If there is conflict over the provisional
amendment, the process for resolving conflict will be implemented. If necessary, based on the
outcome of the conflict resolution process, a revised amendment will be submitted to the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System Board for approval.
