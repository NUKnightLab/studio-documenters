Summary: Contract #17-31-110R consists of the manufacture and distribution of a variety of logoed,
silkscreened and embroidered apparel for use by Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Preserves”)
staff. The specifications also include the development and maintenance of an online store to monitor stock,
facilitate departmental ordering, and allow for current employees to purchase additional apparel. This
contract will be managed by the General Office, and utilized by all Forest Preserve departments to
consolidate and centralize districtwide apparel purchasing.

The Preserves issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the aforementioned services. The Preserves’
review panel determined the three (3) initial responses received to be economically disadvantageous and
unresponsive to the contract specifications. As a result, the RFP was subsequently rebid in order to clarify
the specifications and expand the list of qualified respondents. Silk Screen Express, Inc.’s proposal was
determined to be responsible and responsive, with particular strengths in experience, proposed approach,
and capacity to perform all aspects of the work. Silk Screen Express, Inc. was the sole respondent to the
second bid posting.
