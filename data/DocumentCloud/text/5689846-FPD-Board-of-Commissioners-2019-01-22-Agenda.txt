PROPOSED RESOLUTION
TO REACH NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050
WHEREAS, the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the
Government strive to be leaders in addressing climate change, and

“Forest

Preserves”)

and

Cook

County

WHEREAS, both units of government are working to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions by 80
percent by the year 2050, a goal that is consistent with attempting to keep global temperatures from
increasing more than 2°C over preindustrial temperatures, per the 2012 Doha Amendment to the United
Nations Kyoto Protocol; and
WHEREAS, with nearly 70,000 acres of land, the Forest Preserves of Cook County ecosystems play an
essential climate change mitigation role by absorbing over 1,544,000 tons of CO2 annually, and further
restoration projects will help sequester even more CO2; and
WHEREAS, each year, ecosystems within the Forest Preserves already provide $469 million of
ecosystem services including the above mentioned carbon storage and including flood control, water
purification and groundwater recharge; and
WHEREAS, in October 2018, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a new study
of the impacts of global warming; and

Page 2 of 22

 FPD Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

January 22, 2019

WHEREAS, the report’s findings predict ocean rise of an additional 10 cm with 2°C warming compared
to 1.5°C, an arctic free of sea ice in Summer once per decade compared to once per century, complete
eradication of coral reefs compared to a 90 percent decline, and the loss of many more ecosystems; and
WHEREAS, in November 2018, the U.S. Global Change Research Program released the U.S. National
Climate Assessment, which predicted that climate change could reduce the size of the U. S. economy by
10 percent by the end of the century; and
WHEREAS, an estimated minimum 200 million people around the globe would be subject to inundation
from rising seas, and several hundred million more to climate related risks and poverty; and
WHEREAS, the current effects of climate change on Cook County from the warming of over 1°C that
has already occurred include increased flooding, heavier rain and snow storms, and more extreme summer
heat, all affecting the region’s people and economy; and
WHEREAS, the expected future impacts of global warming in Cook County include threats to food
supply from impacts on agricultural crops and livestock; increase of invasive species; wildlife habitat
destruction; extinction of native plant and insect species; increased incidence of pests and diseases;
vulnerability of water supply and decreased quality of water; threats to infrastructure such as roads, rail,
water supply and wastewater management; decreased air quality; threats of global unrest causing
homelessness and immigration and disruption of business supply chains and markets; and, threats to many
natural habitats and species, among others; and
WHEREAS, the IPCC concluded that limiting warming to 1.5°C is possible, but would require global net
human-caused emissions of CO2 to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero
around 2050; and
WHEREAS, limiting CO2 emissions in the Forest Preserves to these levels would require additional
resources and new technologies, and change on an unprecedented scale, including rapid and far-reaching
changes in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities, and
WHEREAS, many of the actions required are already underway but would need to accelerate, and action
across all fronts will need to proceed as fast as possible; and
WHEREAS, many of the actions required could either save money and resources, or improve other
aspects of quality of life and our ability to adapt successfully to the climate change that is already
underway; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Forest Preserves of
Cook County does hereby adopt the following goal: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent by
2030 and to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a plan shall be developed to achieve this goal, and that progress

Page 3 of 22

 FPD Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

January 22, 2019

towards this goal shall be reported by the Forest Preserves of Cook County annually; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that other local government agencies and businesses who interact
with the Forest Preserves of Cook County are urged to join with us in adopting this greenhouse gas
reduction goal to counter the most harmful effects of climate change.

PROPOSED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Forest Preserves”) to
enter into a Partnership Agreement with Friends of the Chicago River, Chicago, Illinois.
Reason: Friends of the Chicago River has received a grant from the National Fish & Wildlife Foundation
via the Chi-Cal Rivers Fund in the amount of $242,668.96 to support the restoration of Crooked Creek, a
tributary of the Cal-Sag Channel located within the Palos-Sag Valley region in southwest Cook County.

The project will restore the waterway’s natural system of infiltration by removing invasive plants from 207
acres and allowing native plants to enhance absorbance.
This will lead to improved water quality,
decreased storm water volume entering Crooked Creek, and improved habitat for wildlife.
Total budget costs for the project are $492,668.96, of which the Forest Preserves proposes to contribute
$250,000.00 in cash match and other in-kind support representing an approximate 50% match. This match
is being partially met through ongoing brush clearing work at Spears Woods and Pioneer Woods
throughout the winters of 2018 and 2019.
