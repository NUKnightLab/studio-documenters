That the principal of Edward Jenner Elementary Academy of the Arts Berlinder Fry, be
removed and replaced pursuant to Section of the Illinois School Code and that her contract be
terminated pursuant to Section of the Board's Uniform Principal's Performance Contract.

DESCRIPTION:
I. Legal Framework

The Illinois School Code grants the Chief Executive O?iCer of the Chicago Public Schools the
authority to place schools on probation to correct de?ciencies in their academic performance (105 ILCS
5134-83). The Illinois School Code further grants the Board of Education of the City of Chicago ('Board")
the authority to establish guidelines to determine the factors for placing an attendance center on
probation. 105 ILCS 

Pursuant to that authority. the Board has adopted policies under which Jenner was placed on probation

eight years ago. The Board adopted the "School Performance, Remediation and Probation Policy for the
2013-2014 School Year," (Board Report 13-0424-P02) (?Performance Policy") and Jenner remained on
Probation last year in accordance with the terms of that policy.

The Illinois School Code provides that when a school on probation fails to make adequate progress to
correct de?ciencies within one year. the CEO, with the approval of the Board and after an opportunity for
a hearing, may remove and replace the school's principal. 105 ILCS Pursuant to Section
of the Board's Uniform Principal's Performance Contract, a principal's contract may be terminated
before the expiration of its four?year term based upon the principal?s removal pursuant to Section 34-


II. Hearing on Principal Removal

Pursuant to the CEO's ?Guidelines for the Removal and Replacement of Principals of Schools on
Probation for the 2013-2014 School? Year? and the "Procedures Governing Principal Removal Hearings,"
Berlinder Fry. the Jenner Local School Council (LSC) members, and the assistant principals of Jenner
were duly noti?ed that the CEO was contemplating the removal of Berlinder Fry as principal pursuant to
Section to further the school's educational improvement. Frederick Bates, Esq. an
independent hearing of?cer, presided over the Jenner principal removal hearing on November 12. 2014,
in an ef?cient and impartial manner.

December 17, 2014

The Law Department, representing the CEO, presented the statements of the Chief of Schools for
Network 6, Herald Chip Johnson, and the Director of Performance Data and Policy for the Chicago Public
Schools, Ryan Crosby, as well as documentation to support a recommendation to remove Berlinder Fry
as Jenner's principal to the hearing officer. The hearing was uncontested.

The hearing of?cer has submitted a written report to the CEO summarizing all relevant evidence offered
during the hearing, making ?ndings of fact, and advised the CEO that suf?cient evidence exists to support
the removal of Berlinder Fry as the principal of Jenner.

Chief Executive Of?cer?s Recommendation

The CEO has reviewed the Hearing Officers report and hereby recommends that Berlinder Fry be
removed and replaced as the principal of Jenner effective on December 17, 2014. The CEO further
recommends that Fry?s Uniform Principal's Performance Contract. with a term beginning July 1, 2011, and
ending on June 30, 2015, be terminated on December 17, 2014. These recommendations are based
upon the following factors:

A. Jenner has a history of poor performance. Jenner has been on probation for the past eight (8)
consecutive school years. Berlinder Fry has been the principal of Jenner since July 1, 2011.

B. For six years Jenner has been a Level 3 school. In the 2007-2008 school year, Jenner received
357% of available points pursuant to the Board's Performance Policy- In the 2008-2009 school
year, it received 262% of available points. In the 2009-2010 school year it received 21.4% of
available points. In the 2010-2011 school year, it received 45.2% of available points. In the 2011-
2012 school year, it received 38.1% of available points. In the 2012-2013 school year, it received
21.4% of available points.

C. For uniform measurement purposes, the resutts of the Illinois Standards Achievement Test
for the 2012-2013 school year are helpful in assessing Jenner?s performance. Jenner?s
2012?2013 ISAT Meets or Exceeds Composite score, which is the combined result of the ISAT
reading, mathematics, and science assessments, was 16.6%, compared to a network average of
70.2% and a District average of 55.1%. In reading, the percent of Jenner students meeting or
exceeding state standards was 13.3%, compared to a network average of 67.2% and a District
average of 50.9%. In mathematics Jenner?s performance was 12%, compared to a network
average of 67.9% and a District average of 52.4%. In science Jennefs performance was 43.1%,
compared to a network average of 86% and a District average of 75.8%.

D. This widening gap is also shown when comparing the percentage of students exceeding state
standards. In 2012-2013 Jenner?s ISAT Composite Exceeds score was compared to a
network average of 23.1%, and a District average of 11.6%. Jenner?s Composite Exceeds score
was 10.6 percentage points below the network average in 2005-2006 and 22.1 percentage points
below the network average in 2012-2013. Jenner?s Composite Exceeds score was 4 percentage
points below the District average in 2005-2006 and 10.6 percentage points below the District
average in 2012-2013.

E. Jenner's reading value-added score was -0.9 in 2009-2010, 0.2 in 2010-2011, 0.4 in 2011-2012
and -0.5 in 2012-2013. Its mathematics value-added score was -0.3 in 2009-2010, 2.0 in 2010-
2011, 0.4 in 2011-2012, and -1.6 in 2012-2013. This means that. on average, students at
Jenner grew at a below-average pace in two of the last four years in reading and three of the last
four years in math. As a point of reference, Jenner?s reading value-added score of -0.5 in 2012-
2013 was in the 27th percentile and its math value-added score of ~1.6 was in the 6th percentile.

F. Jenner is on probation in accordance with state law and the Board?s Performance Policy. The
has tow performance, this performance is consistently low across subject areas, and the
school is not making suf?cient progress in catching up to the rest of the District.

If the Board adopts the CEO's recommendation to remove the Jenner principal, the following actions will
occur.

1. The CEO will appoint an interim principal for Jenner. The interim principal will serve at the
pleasure of the 
2. The LSC shall have no authority to select a new four-year contract principal until Jenner makes

suf?cient academic progress to be removed from probation; and

3. The Uniform Principal's Performance Contract of Berlinder Fry will be terminated effective
December 17, 2014.

LSC REVIEW: LSC approval is not applicable to this report.
FINANCIAL: The interim principal position will be ?lled at a cost within current budget appropriations.
PERSONNEL IMPLICATIONS: An Interim Principal will be selected, who will serve at the pleasure of the

CEO. Until the school comes off probation, the Local School Council of Jenner will have no authority to
select a new four-year contract principal, as required by Board Policy.

Karen Mulattierj, Chief Officer of QLCE

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Payments cover a fraction of tuition for authorized CPS teachers enrolled in
courses at participating universities under the ESUBilingual Endorsement Initiative. The ESUBiIinguai
Endorsement Initiative provides an opportunity for CPS teachers to pursue an ESL or bilingual
endorsement so that an increased number of English Language Learners (ELs) in CPS are taught by
competent and expert educators who are able to meet the unique needs of these students. Providing an
opportunity to earn an ESL or bilingual endorsement is critical to ensuring that all CPS students receive
appropriate support and have access to high quality, rigorous education. Equally important, this program
is essential for the district to be in compliance with Illinois state and federal laws. rules and regulations. it
is vision that every EL in CPS is taught by an appropriately certified, endorsed, expert
teacher. Offering cohorts of teachers the opportunity to engage in the coursework together. to
collaborate. and to Ieam with and from each other is an important step towards actualizing the vision.
Concordia University is One of the universities that provide the ESL and bilingual coursework

PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the ESUBillngual Endorsement Initiative coursework will include CPS
teachers who possess an IL teaching certi?cate, have demonstrated leadership skills. and desire to
obtain an ESL or Bilingual Endorsement to support ELs in CPS. Participants will be selected through a
competitive process; they will commit to an eighteen (18) month sequence of courses to teaching at CPS
for at least two years after obtaining their ESL or bilingual endorsement, and to maintaining at least 90%
attendance and a grade of or higher in every coursa.

In addition, the ESL/Bilingual Endorsement Initiative is aligned to our district goals of ensuring that every
child has access to high quality teaching and learning in alignment with the Common Core State
Standards. All teachers who enroll in these courses will bene?t by having opportunities to become expert
in using instructional strategies and providing support to ELs. thus ensuring that they gain access to
rigorous content and meet the ambitious new standards.

OUTCOMES: The ESL/Bilingual Endorsement initiative Coursework program will result in an increased
number of educated and properly endorsed teachers of ELs in our district. This creates increased
opportunities for students to learn more rigorous content and not only expand the opportunities to
