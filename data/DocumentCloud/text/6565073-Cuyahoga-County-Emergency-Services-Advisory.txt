NEORAMSS LIAISON REPORT FOR CCESAB MEETING APRIL 11, 2019
 
Northeast Ohio Region AMS [NEORAMSS]: Peter D. Killmer, Executive Coordinator 
 
A) The next meeting (spring) of the NEORAMSS Executive Board (i.e., Executive Board

members and invited guests only) will be held at US Coast Guard Marine Safety Unit
[USCG MSU] Cleveland on Thursday, April 18, 2019 (0900-1100). For future planning
purposes, the next NEORAMSS general member meeting (summer) will be held on
Thursday, June 6, 2019 at Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District E49th Street
conference rooms B&C. The June meeting will be held to conduct a tabletop exercise
[TTX] in discussion and planning for the 2019 Tall Ships [TS] Challenge Cleveland. The
TTX will be for event principals by invitation only. The TS 2019 real world event will
occur in the Port of Cleveland during the period 11-15 July 2019. It immediately follows
the 2019 MLB All Star Game on July 9, 2019 at Progressive Field in downtown
Cleveland. There will be a great deal of activity in the maritime domain (e.g., along the
Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie, respectively) during this entire week long time frame. 
B) The Mid-Term Planning Meeting [MPM] for Incident Action Planning for the 2019 Tall

Ships Challenge will be held at USCG MSU Cleveland on Thursday, April 18, 2019
immediately after the NEORAMSS Executive Board meeting. It is expected that the
MPM will start around 1130 a.m. with a planned end at approximately 1:30 pm.  
C) Planning is ongoing for the expected port visits of the US Navy Littoral Combat Ships
Billings (LCS-15) in June 2019 and Indianapolis (LCS-17) in October 2019. These
vessels are newly minted at the Marinette, Wisconsin shipyard and will be heading to
their final homeport destination in Mayport, (Jacksonville) Florida. The vessels will be
making logistics stop(s) in Great Lakes ports including Cleveland. The visits will require
multi-agency participation and planning to ensure maritime port security.
