WHEREUPON, Dean Angelo, President of the Fraternal Order of Police entered the proceedings.
Discussion was held concerning Public Act 99-0905, which contains changes to the cost-of-living
provision for retired Police members. The Executive Director reported that Fund’s staff was able to
adjust and implement a 3% increase, for members born after 1955 that have at least one year of
retirement, reflected in their January 31, 2017, annuity disbursements.

January 26, 2017
Page 6.
The other element of Public Act 95-0905, concerns a catch-up provision. The calculation concerning the
‘catch-up’ amounts will begin in February with payments thereafter to those retired members affected. To
perform these calculations on approximately 1400 retired members, the process will take several months.
The Executive Director informed that there is another group, which is a population that has received
initial 1.5% increases in 2015 and 2016. Those are officers that were born in '55 and '56 that reached the
age of sixty in 2015 or 2016 and had a year of retirement behind them on their sixtieth birthday. Board’s
legal counsel has advised that the Public Act references the catch-up calculations applicable to the group
that ‘has not received the initial increase’ under this subsection before January 1, 2017. As such, based
upon the enacted legislation, those officers born in 1955 and 1956, who have already received an initial
cost-of-living increase in either 2015 or 2016, would not be receiving a catch-up. They will be receiving
3 percent in 2017 and for every year thereafter that they are living, but the catch-up provision based on
PA99-0905, does not provide for a catch-up contribution to them.
Board’s counsel and Mr. Angelo entered into discussion concerning this newly enacted provision, and
interpretation of same.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Hauser that the Board enter into executive session.

A partial resolution concerning PA99-0905 was agreed upon by Board members. The executive director
recapped; retired members, who were eligible, received a 3% increase in their January 31, 2017, annuity
disbursement. Calculation of any ‘catch-up’ amounts will begin in February and take until approximately
June to complete. Members in the other group discussed, who had already received a 1.5% increase in
2015 and/or 2016, the Board is requesting legislative interpretation of the language in PA99-0905, or
further communication from the legislative sponsor, and the Fund will proceed on those members
thereafter.
WHEREUPON, Dean Angelo, President of the Fraternal Order of Police left the proceedings.
In the matter of Joseph Smith, attorney, Kara Amouyal of Blake Horwitz Law Firm, appeared
before the Board on behalf of Mr. Smith. Board counsel indicated that there were tentative
discussions with Mr. Horwitz. Ms. Amouyal indicated that the offer in such discussions was
rejected. With this rejection, Board counsel indicated that it has all of the documents that it needs
and will make a ruling, after which Mr. Smith, via his attorney, may file an administrative review
or do whatever he thinks is best.

A draft letter from a current police officer member, Joseph Lullo, was distributed to the Board.
This member is considering taking a position in the Mayor’s office and he is inquiring about his
eligibility for continuation of benefits or service accrual in this Fund. It was concluded by the Board
that the Board’s counsel forward a draft response to the Corporation Counsel for review, with a
thirty day requested response, to obtain a current interpretation of 5/5-214 (b); which could then be
forwarded to the member citing to the Pension Act.

•

Communications with a retired police officer, Alyce Dalto, concerning the amount of her refund of
widow’s annuity accumulations was discussed. This member has police service credit for 30+
years, however she was in receipt of duty disability benefits for 20+ years during her career.
Contributions refunded to her reflect contributions made during her active service and not during
her period on duty disability. The Board agreed that the Pension Act does not provide for a refund
of the widow’s annuity accumulations to include City’s contributions made on her behalf. The
refundable amount is the amount paid in by member, with statutory interest. The Board agreed
with the draft response to Ms. Dalto’s request, and directed such letter be sent accordingly.

A letter from the Office of Budget Management was distributed to the Board. In March 2015, this
Fund received pension contributions for a bonus that was paid to upper rank exempts above the
rank of Captain (approximately fifty members). The Fund received a letter from Ms. Holt
indicating that the Fund should not have received this contribution, and it was not pensionable
earnings. The amounts range between $600 and $800 per exempt. The Executive Director met
with John Arvetas to discuss the refund of these contribution amounts. For those members that
have retired (approximately twenty-five members), the Fund will refund such contributions directly
back to the member in a taxable distribution. The refund check and a letter will be completed in
the next few months. For the actives, the City of Chicago Comptroller's office has requested that
they offset the amount with the February 15th pension contributions from their regular pensionable
compensation.

It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Maloney that the Board enter into executive
session.
