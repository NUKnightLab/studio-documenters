Present:

President Stroger, Commissioners Goslin, Hansen, Maldonado, Moreno, Quigley and Steele

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Monday, April 19, 2004 at the hour of 8:30 A.M . on the 35th Floor,
Cook County Administration Building, 69 West Washington Street, Chicago, Illinois.
President Stroger welcomed the public officials in attendance.
President Stroger next discussed the breadth of Cook County: It is the largest county in the State of
Illinois, with a budget of $3 billion (with less than 25% coming from property taxes). Cook County
accounts for ha lf of the State' s population. The Cook County Bureau of Health operates four hospitals,
thirty community clinics, a nationally recognized public health department for suburban residents, and the
CORE Center, an infectious disease facility that treats patients with AIDS/HIV and other respiratory
diseases. The public safety system includes one of the largest unified court systems in the nation. This
court system includes thirty courtrooms and the largest single-site jail complex in the country which
houses between I 0,000-l l ,OOO detainees per day. Also included in County government is the State's
Attorney's Office, the Clerk of the Court and the Public Defender. The Highway Department maintains
500 miles of road throughout the County. The County provides job training to thousands each year. The
Cook County Forest Preserve District holds more than 68,000 acres of open space, which is ten percent of
the land mass of Cook County; the County also holds titles to and provides $20 million in operating funds
to the Brookfield Zoo and the Botanical Gardens.
President Stroger next introduced the items up for discussion: I) Cook County should have administrative
adjudication; it is the only county in the State that does not. 2) The County Board President should serve
as a voting member on the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, as several public safety
agencies report to the President. 3) The Tuberculosis Sanitarium District should be dissolved; it is the
only remaining such district in existence in Illinois and is underutilized. 4) The Governor should restore
the $7.5 million he eliminated in funding for the Cook County Detention Center. This cut makes Cook
County the only county in the State not receiving 40% of its operating funds from the State for this
purpose. 5) The Governor should restore the $1 million in funding to the Cook County Boot Camp
program. 6) The State should provide funding to the Cook County Detention Center for the thousands of
people who, at a cost of $80 per day, are housed by the Detention Center but should be housed by the
State penitentiary because they are on parole. 7) The Governor should restore funding to the Open Space
Land Acquisition and Development Fund, which is critical to the Forest Preserve Unit.

law enforcement authorities; and
WHEREAS, Tinley Park MHC employs more than 300 people in our region, including doctors, nurses
and other professionals and its workers receive fair wages, good benefits and workplace rights; and
WHEREAS, Governor Rod Blagojevich has promised to make increasing health services a state priority.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of Cook hereby states its opposition to the
closure of Tinley Park Mental Health Center and urges Governor Blagojevich to reconsider his proposal
to close the facility; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook urges legislators in the Illinois General
