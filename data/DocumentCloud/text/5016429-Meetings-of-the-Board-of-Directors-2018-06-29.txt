Board and Committee Reports
A. Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, May 25, 2018
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Reiter, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting of May 25, 2018. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Human Resources Committee Meeting, June 21, 2018
i. Metrics (Attachment #1)
ii. Meeting Minutes
Director Richardson-Lowry and Barbara Pryor, Interim Chief Human Resources Officer, provided an overview of
the metrics and Meeting Minutes. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the subject of recruiting bilingual staff, Director Junge inquired whether there is a premium
pay incentive for those positions identified as bilingual. Ms. Pryor responded that, if the position requires the
employee to have bilingual skills, a pay differential is paid to the employee. Approximately sixty (60) employees
currently receive bilingual pay compensation because their position requires that skill. Director Suleiman Gonzalez
inquired regarding the process for determining whether a position requires or does not require bilingual proficiency.
Ms. Pryor responded that a large part of the input on that decision comes from the leaders and managers of the
various areas; a lot of it is based on the patients served in those areas. Often, bilingual proficiency is listed as a
preferred qualification for positions, but the administration is trying to move more towards it being a requirement in
those specific job descriptions. Director Suleiman Gonzalez inquired whether there is a template or guidelines to
help determine whether a position should be bilingual, based on the demographics. Ms. Pryor responded in the
negative; however, she appreciated the suggestion, and will look into the subject further.
Chair Hammock inquired whether exit interviews are done for those employees who leave the System, to determine
the cause of separation. Ms. Pryor stated that exit interviews are sometimes conducted, but are not always
consistently done; oftentimes, the Human Resources Department is not engaged in the exit process. Because the
administration needs to get ahead of that, she plans to start looking at that in the coming months. The Human
Resources Department also sends a survey to employees as they exit; however, the response rates are fairly low. She
plans to take a closer look at that, too, to determine what improvements can be made.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Thomas, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Human Resources Committee Meeting of June 21, 2018. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Managed Care Committee Meeting, June 21, 2018
i. Metrics (Attachment #2)
ii. Meeting Minutes
Director Junge and James Kiamos, Executive Director of Managed Care, reviewed the metrics and Meeting Minutes.
The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information on the Provider Network, on slide 4 of the metrics, Director Driscoll
inquired how the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN) clinics are counted within
these numbers. Mr. Kiamos responded that he will break that information out in future presentations.

Board and Committee Reports
C.

Managed Care Committee Meeting, June 21, 2018 (continued)

Chair Hammock noted that, previously, the Board received information on the number of members lost, due
principally to redetermination. He believes that it would be useful for the Committee and Board to see those losses
each month just to make sure the Board understands what is happening. Mr. Kiamos responded that this can be
provided. Chair Hammock stated that, in anticipation of the open enrollment period, perhaps there could be two (2)
lines: one (1) would reflect losses by redetermination, and the other would reflect losses resulting from members
choosing a different health plan. Director Thomas added that it would be good to know how many people are aging
out of Medicaid and into Medicare, so the System can start attracting more seniors. Mr. Kiamos agreed; he offered
to look into it further and perhaps put together a strategy on that.
Director Thomas, seconded by Director Reiter, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Managed Care Committee Meeting of June 21, 2018. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
D. Finance Committee Meeting, June 22, 2018
i. Metrics (Attachment #3)
ii. Meeting Minutes, which included the following action items and report:
• Contracts and Procurement Items and Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items (detail
was provided as an attachment to the Board Agenda)
Director Reiter presented the Meeting Minutes for the Board’s consideration. Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial
Officer, reviewed the metrics..
Charles Jones, Chief Procurement Officer, provided a brief overview of the contractual requests that were considered
at the Finance Committee Meeting. It was noted that none of the proposed contracts are pending review by Contract
Compliance. Board Agenda Action Item VII(A) was also reviewed and discussed at this time.
During the discussion of the information on slide 3 of the metrics, regarding Operating Margin observations, several
questions arose. Director Munar inquired whether trending data is available on the System-wide uninsured numbers,
particularly around the Stroger Hospital number, to break it out among the major categories, including the Emergency
Department (ED), inpatient admissions, and the Department of Surgery. Mr. Akpan responded that he can break
down that number and provide the information. Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether there are any strategies
planned around improvement in the areas referenced in the information. She noted that the specialty care visits were
up 7%; she inquired whether the administration has looked at where those occurrences are and whether those
efficiencies can be replicated in other areas. Dr. Shannon suggested that staff return to the Board at a later time to
present detail on those areas, perhaps as a strategic planning update to the Board.
Mr. Akpan noted that he worked with Ms. Pryor to present information on open positions in Revenue Cycle and
Health Information Management (included in the metrics); this information was requested at the recent Human
Resources Committee Meeting.
Director Reiter, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Meeting of the Finance Committee of June 22, 2018. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B.

Approve 2018 Plan for Patient Care for John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County (Attachment #8)

Dr. Wyatt provided an overview of the proposed 2018 Plan for Patient Care for John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of
Cook County.
Chair Hammock noted that there are a lot of metrics being collected; he requested that, at some point in the
future, within the next two (2) to three (3) months, the Board be provided with a limited set of these metrics what Dr. Wyatt believes the Board should be aware of and should be monitoring at a strategic level. Additionally,
he would like to see that list added to the Plan document so there can be no question about how the narrative
portion of the report is being measured. Director Driscoll stated that it is important to include in the Plan a list
of who is on the Hospital Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (HQuIPS) Committee, by position, to make
sure that the proper disciplines are represented on that committee. Also, since it states in the Plan document that
the Board and Quality and Patient Safety Committee is ultimately responsible, Director Driscoll requested that
the Board or Quality and Patient Safety Committee be presented with high-level minutes from the meetings of
the HQuIPS Committee.

approval for FY2020. He estimates that a draft strategic plan could be ready for approval by this Board in late spring,
perhaps around May 2019, followed by final approval by this Board in the summer along with the approval of the
FY2020 budget.

 CCDPH TB Treatment and Control
• CCDPH operates 3 TB clinics in suburban Cook County
• Three clinics needed due to size of jurisdiction (700 sq miles), TB cluster
locations and limited availability of public transportation options.
• Provide medical care, nursing, case management, x-ray, phlebotomy,
medication
• Des Plaines = 63% of visits
• Forest Park = 29% of visits
• Oak Forest = 8% of visits (2015 – 2017 data)
• 1 physician rotates to all 3 sites weekly:
– 4 sessions at Des Plaines,
– 2 or 3 at Forest Park
– 1 at Oak Forest

Page 64 of 140

 Case Management
• Monitor and ensure the quality of all TB-related activities in
their jurisdiction.
• CDC requires that all TB patients assigned a case manager
wherever they receive care.
• Each TB patient is assigned an RN Case Manager who ensures
that all treatment and public health activities affiliated with
the TB patient are completed for each patient.

through its Quality and Patient Safety Committee, which has direct oversight of the
quality and safety of care delivered.

QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF CARE
Purpose
The purpose of the Quality & Patient Safety Plan supports the systematic
organization-wide approach to plan, design, measure, assess and improve
organizational performance.

Initiatives are designed to:
Attain optimal patient outcomes and patient and family experience
Support an engaged workforce and safe workspace
Enhance appropriate utilization
Minimize risks and hazards of care
Develop and share best practices

The Plan is intended to provide a framework of guiding principles for all participants
in the provision of care. This structure will set proper expectation and encourage
all to participate proactively in the improvement process and in sustaining a safetyoriented culture. The Quality & Patient Safety Plan facilitates the identification of
key functions of the organization; the assessment of the quality, safety and
appropriateness of these functions; and the generation of measurable
improvements.

SCOPE AND ACTIVITIES
This plan applies to all inpatient services and sites of care. The Performance
Improvement and Patient Safety Program includes an ongoing assessment, using
internal and external knowledge and experience, to prevent error occurrence and
maintain and improve healthcare safety and quality. It is recognized that patients,
staff, visitors and other customers have the right to expect the best possible clinical
outcomes, a safe environment and an error free care experience. Therefore, the
organization commits to continuous designing, monitoring performance, analyzing
2 Page
Page 78 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

data, improving and sustaining performance while undertaking a proactive
approach to the identification and mitigation of medical errors. The organization
responds quickly, effectively, and appropriately when errors occur. We recognize
that the patient has the right to be informed of the results of treatments or
procedures including whenever those results differ significantly from anticipated
outcome.
Additional program specifics include:
1) All departments within the organization (patient care and non-patient care
departments) are responsible for on-going performance improvement and quality
assurance activities. These efforts are monitored through the organizational
leadership structure and key indicators are reported to the Hospital Quality
Improvement and Patient Safety (HQuIPS) Committee and the CCHHS Quality
and Patient Safety Committee.
2) All departments within the organization (patient care and non-patient care
departments) are responsible to report healthcare safety occurrence and potential
incidence. The electronic event reporting system is available on all computers, to
report unexpected events and near misses. Summary data from the event
reporting system will be aggregated and presented periodically to the Hospitalwide Oversight Committee, HQuIPS and the CCHHS Quality and Patient Safety
Committee, who will determine further safety (risk reduction) activities as
appropriate.

3) Upon identification of a medical/health care actual or potential care adverse
event, the care delivery team will:

Perform in accordance to the event management policy.

An effective Patient Safety Program cannot exist without optimal reporting of
medical/health care errors and occurrences. Therefore, the plan adopts a just
approach in its management of errors and occurrences. All personnel are required
to report suspected and identified medical/health care errors, and should do so
without the fear of reprisal in relationship to their employment. This organization
supports the concept that errors occur due to a breakdown in systems and
processes, and will focus on improving systems and processes. Emphasis will be
placed on remedial actions and individual development to assist staff members
rather than punish them.
3 Page

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

4) Through review of internal and external data sources (including, but not limited
to reports from evidence based medicine centers, the Joint Commission and
current literature), the Hospital-wide Oversight Committee will select at least one
high-risk safety process to undergo Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
annually.

5) The Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Program includes an
assessment of staff (including medical staff) opinions, as appropriate, regarding
perceptions of risks to patients and the culture of the healthcare environment to
facilitate safe practices, and suggestions for improving patient safety and clinical
outcomes by promoting the culture of safety surveys.

6) The Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Program includes an
ongoing assessment of patient satisfaction through the use of a comprehensive
survey tools.

7) Patients, and when appropriate, their families are informed about the outcomes
of care, including unanticipated after effects, or when the results differ significantly
from the anticipated outcomes, following guidelines outlined in this plan.

8) Staff will educate patients and their families about their role in helping to facilitate
the safe delivery of care. Patient and family safety education interventions are
documented in the patient’s medical record.

9) Staff will receive education and training during their initial orientation and on an
ongoing basis regarding job-related aspects of patient safety, including the need
to report and reduce medical/health care errors and the methods that go about
when reporting. In addition, staff will be educated and trained on the provision of
an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to patient care.

4 Page
Page 80 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

10) Medical/health care errors and occurrences, including sentinel events, will be
reported in accordance with all national and regulatory body rules, laws and
requirements.

11) Leaders will provide feedback to staff when they have identified a safety issue
or occurrence.

Guiding Principles

 Provide safe and quality clinical services and demonstrate superior patient
outcomes
Assess performance with objective and relevant measures
Achieve quality improvement goals in a systematic manner through collaboration
with our providers, staff, patients, families, clinical programs and services and our
community by means of education, goal-oriented change processes, evaluation
and feedback
Establish a culture that commits to a goal of preventable Zero Harm to patients
as a result of our care. This culture focuses on safety where we openly report
mistakes and take action to make improvements in our processes
 Identify and focus on functions that are important to our customers and
implement changes which will increase satisfaction
 Optimize the allocation of resources to ensure the delivery of safe and quality
care
 Enhance the national and international art and science of healthcare quality by
embracing the principles of a “learning organization” and presenting key learnings
and original research through professional meetings, journals, and forums
Utilize Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria that are as follows:
•
•

The efficacy of the procedure or treatment in relation to the patient’s
condition. (Is it best practice?)
The appropriateness of a specific test, procedure, treatment, or service to
meet the patient’s needs. (Is it relevant to the patient’s needs? Did it meet
criteria?)

that enable them to lead healthy lives evident?)

OBJECTIVES
The Quality Improvement and Patient Safety Plan is a description of the
organizational, multidisciplinary, and systematic performance improvement
function designed to support the Mission, Values, and Philosophy of the John H.
Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County. The intent of the Quality Improvement and
Patient Safety Plan is to identify the health system’s approach to improving and
sustaining its performance through the prioritization, design, implementation,
monitoring, and analysis of performance improvement initiatives. Moreover, the
Quality Improvement and Safety Plan is an ongoing program that demonstrates
measurable improvement in indicators for which there is evidence that they will
improve patient outcomes, and identify and reduce medical errors. The Quality
Improvement and Patient Safety Plan, with total support of Leadership, will utilize
internal and external reference databases in an ongoing effort to design, assess,
measure, and improve the delivery of care process and outcomes. In accordance
with The Joint Commission (TJC) Standards, and the vision of the Cook County
Health and Hospitals System, the following expectations regarding healthcare
delivery have been established:

6) Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics
such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location and socioeconomic status by:
a) Assuring the highest standard of care is delivered to each patient every time
regardless of personal characteristics

PERFORMANCE SAFETY PLAN PRIORITIES & GOALS
The approach to performance improvement is continuously assessed and revised
to meet the goal of ensuring that patient outcomes are continually improved and
safe patient care is provided. Examples of information utilized to achieve this goal
include: variance related data such as medication errors and falls; infection
prevention surveillance; sentinel event alerts; and The Joint Commission Quality
Measures data, as well as, patient satisfaction reports. The criteria used to
prioritize opportunities for improvement include, but are not limited to:
Patient Safety
Strategic plan goals/objectives
Mission/vision
Quality outcomes
8 Page
Page 84 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

Patient care operations
Efficiency of care
Customer satisfaction

The John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County recognizes that to be effective in
improving patient safety there must be an integrated and coordinated approach to
reducing errors. While taking into consideration high risk, high volume, high cost
and problem prone processes this plan establishes the following Quality
Improvement/Patient Safety goals:
1. Achieve a Patient Safety conscious environment integrated throughout the
facility.
2. Improve the reporting of medical errors by establishing a policy focusing on
corrective actions through staff education rather than punitive or disciplinary
actions for those who report their own errors.
3. Maximize confidential electronic Event Reporting process that includes
documentation of follow-up and reporting processes.
4. Expand the implementation of evidence-based practices.
5. Monitor system-wide indicators for established areas of focus.
6. Reduce the number of medication errors.
7. Monitor patient safety indicators related to each facilities specific to “Scope of
Service.”
8. Conduct proactive risk assessment utilizing the Failure Mode, Effects Analysis
Methodology.
9. Monitor and improve areas identified through Patient Satisfaction Surveys.
Performance improvement priorities and activities may be reprioritized based on
significant organizational performance findings or changes in regulatory
requirements, patient population, environment of care, and expectations and
needs of patients, staff, or the community. Priorities may be reset by the
multidisciplinary Hospital Quality Improvement and Patient Safety committee in
consultation with Senior Management and Executive Medical Staff leadership.

SCOPE
9 Page
Page 85 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

The plan integrates all clinical services and facilities impacting patient care
including contracted services. Facilities develop annual goals to address and
support improvement of the care, treatment, service and safety outcomes that align
with the organizations mission. These goals become the essence of the
organization-wide Quality & Patient Safety improvement activities.
GUIDELINES FOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
Methodology
Quality & Patient Safety plan will measure and monitor quality outcomes and
implement appropriate changes using the following the guidelines:
 Use data to identify and quantify areas of improvement opportunities (QI) and
areas that we are maintaining or improving (QA)
Use reporting structure to perform ongoing risk assessment
Analysis and comparison may include:
•
•
•
•

Performance compared internally over time (patterns/trends)
Performance compared with similar processes in other organizations
Performance compared to up-to-date external sources (benchmarking)
Statistical process established for expected variation

Identify gaps using one of more of the IOM criteria (see guiding principles)
Implement quality improvement cycles (PDCA) with all appropriate stakeholders:

John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital may also employ tools for process improvement
and/or redesign, cause-mapping as well as incorporating the concepts of statistical
process control, Six Sigma, and Lean systems thinking to reduce system variation,
delays, and complexity that is detrimental to patient care and safety.
PLAN:

In order to plan and develop effective processes, functions or services, the
following key elements, when relevant and available, are considered:
1. The process design is based on the organization’s mission, vision and
organizational strategic KPI’s.
2. Consideration is given to the needs and expectations of patients, staff, and
others, as well as, the direct effect or criticality of the design on patient care.
3. Research of current literature and practice guidelines are reviewed for
successful or best practice(s).
4. Development is consistent with sound business practices.
5. Baseline performance expectations are utilized to guide measurement and
assessment activities.
Performance monitoring and evaluation standards are department, division,
service line and/or population focused. Certain processes are measured on an
11   P a g e
Page 87 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

ongoing basis both in response to occurrences and proactively. Selected
processes which are high volume, high risk, high cost and problem prone are
measured, analyzed and improved on an ongoing basis.
Performance Improvement projects that are designed or redesigned to monitor
expected performance within the hospital are developed to measure, assess,
improve and maintain process improvements. Performance levels may be
established through comparison performance with other “like” facilities to identify
variations or “failure modes.” Comparative data is used from the multiple sources
e.g. Cerner, CDC, NHSN, TJC, AHRQ or current/past department performance.
Each activity monitored has an established performance level or threshold to
measure expected performance. A strategy for maintaining the effectiveness of the
redesigned process over time is also implemented.

DO:
Data collection is the basis of all Performance Improvement activities and provides
a means of measuring performance through which informed decisions can be
made.
1. Program data is collected for a comprehensive set of performance measures
based on the priorities and frequency established by the leaders of the
organization in order to:
a. Establish a baseline when a process is implemented or redesigned.
b. Describe process performance or stability.
c. Describe the dimensions of performance or stability.
d. Describe the dimensions of performance relevant to functions, processes and
outcomes.
e. Identify areas for improvement including the effect on patients.
f. Determine whether changes in a process have met objectives
g. Implement a strategy for maintaining the effectiveness of the redesigned
process over time.
2. Data is collected as a part of continuing measurement, in addition to data
collected for priority issues.

Check:
Program activities involve the assessment process, which includes the necessary
disciplines of departments to draw conclusions about the need for more intensive
measurement. A systematic process is used to assess collected data in order to
12   P a g e
Page 88 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

determine whether specifications for newly designed processes were met and the
level of performance and stability of important existing processes are observed.
Priorities for possible improvements or redesign of existing processes, actions
taken to improve the performance improvement processes and whether changes
in the processes resulted in improvement are also assessed.
Ongoing data collection and PI activities are regularly reported as follows:
•
•
•

Hospital Quality Improvement and Patient Safety Committee
Executive Medical Staff
CCHHS Board of Directors through its Quality and Patient Safety
Committee

When data analysis identifies a problem or trend, a corrective action plan will be
developed and implemented. These actions may include:
1. System Changes – Changes in communication channels, changes in
organizational structure, adjustments in staffing and changes in equipment or chart
forms.
2. Knowledge Enhancement – In-service education, continuing education and
circulating informational material.
3. Intensive Reviews/Focus Studies – When a medical/health care system errorrelated occurrence is identified; proactive risk assessment activities are
implemented including intensive review and/or a focused study. A data collection
tool is developed to address processes, functions, and services that can be
designed or redesigned to prevent trends that may have contributed to the
problem. Once all charts are reviewed, a summary report is compiled to document
and communicate conclusions.
4. Root Cause Analysis – When a medical/health care error is classified as a
Sentinel Event, the recommended Root Cause Analysis format by TJC is used to
detect the underlying causes of the variation. Upon approval by the Chief Quality
Officer (CQO), the outlined action plan is implemented.
5. Causal Analysis – When a medical/health care error is established as a near
miss, a causal analysis is completed to determine the underlying causes of the
potential variation, the outlined action plan is implemented.
6. Failure Mode Effects Analysis – In accordance with TJC published information
regarding the most frequently occurring types of sentinel events and patient safety
risk factors, at least one high-risk process is selected annually for proactive risk
assessment.
7. Behavior Changes – Informal or formal counseling, consulting, changes in
assignments, and disciplinary action.
8. Policy Revisions – Policies are developed or revised for significant
organizational issues that are interdepartmental or mandated to be system-wide
13   P a g e
Page 89 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

by accreditation agencies or state regulation. Any potential policy revisions are
presented to the Policy Committee to identify the appropriate entity for
development, and ensure that input is obtained and incorporated into a final policy
statement.
9. Multidisciplinary Process Teams – Teams are formed as needed and
oversight is provided by the CQO to investigate and make recommendations when
organization-wide performance becomes unacceptable or when a process has
been identified to be proactively redesigned. The process team presents the
recommendations to HQuIPS for approval.
10. Operational Changes – Any activity that may need to be performed differently
in order to expedite a process or improve overall patient care will be examined and
changed if appropriate.
The assessment process includes the use of statistical process control
techniques/tools as appropriate. When assessment of data indicates a variation in
performance or potential risk to patient safety, more intensive measurements and
analysis will be conducted, and in addition, the department/service or team will
reassess its performance measure.
When a performance measurement does not reach the predetermined optimal
threshold, or if it is attained but further evaluation indicates that performance is not
acceptable, the Performance Improvement process should continue. If the level of
performance shows no improvement for the time frame established by the
identified department/service or team plan, an intensive evaluation should be
conducted with input from the CQO regarding the need for continued measurement
and additional corrective action.
When any process remains stable or minimal variation is demonstrated in overall
performance after two quarters of data collection, the performance measure should
be re-evaluated to determine the need to continue measurement, and if reprioritization of performance measurements should occur.
ACT:
When opportunities for improving performance are identified, a systematic
approach is used to redesign the involved process, or to design a new process.
The leadership will establish hospital-wide priorities and provide adequate
resources to be effective.
1. When a department or service identifies an opportunity for improvement, the
department/service will determine if other disciplines or departments will have an
impact on the design/redesign of the process. If other disciplines or departments
are involved, the opportunity for improvement will be referred to an appointed
team.
2. The assigned team/department will establish priorities for improvement based
on the guidelines established in this plan. When necessary, the CQO will assist
the team or department/service in establishing priorities.

The Quality Improvement and Patient Safety Plan will be reviewed, evaluated, and
revised as necessary to incorporate the most current TJC standards. A summary
of evaluation results will be presented to the HQuIPS Committee, Executive
Medical Staff Committee and the CCHHS Board of Directors through its Quality
and Patient Safety Committee. The annual review will assess, at least, the
objectives, scope, organization effectiveness and appropriateness of the program.
The plan will be modified as needed based on the results of the annual evaluation.
Individual committees and departments will review, evaluate and revise their
performance improvement activities and plans as part of an annual system-wide
review.
Roles and Responsibilities
The Quality Plan supports the organizational structure established by the

Effective Use of Data
Collecting Data
When hospitals collect data or measure staff compliance with evidence-based care
processes or patient outcomes, they can manage and improve those processes or
outcomes and, ultimately, improve patient safety. The effective use of data enables
hospitals to identify problems, prioritize issues, develop solutions, and track to
determine success. Objective data can be used to support decisions, influence
people to change their behaviors, and comply with evidence-based care
guidelines.
Analyzing Data
Effective data analysis can enable a hospital to “diagnose” problems within its
system similar to the way one would diagnose a patient’s illness based on
symptoms, health history, and other factors. Turning data into information is a
critical competency of a learning organization and of effective management of
change. When the right data are collected and appropriate analytic techniques are
applied, it enables the hospital to monitor the performance of a system, detect
variation, and identify opportunities to improve. This can help the hospital not only
understand the current performance of hospital systems but can also help it predict
its performance going forward.
Analyzing data with tools such as run charts, statistical process control (SPC)
charts, and capability charts help a hospital determine what has occurred in a
system and provide clues as to why the system responded as it did.

1. OVERVIEW OF SENTINEL EVENTS
a. When a patient experiences a sentinel event (SE), an unanticipated outcome or
adverse event, near miss, or unsafe condition, the following will collaborate to
identify, analyze, and appropriately report these events: QA, risk management,
and patient safety (under the umbrella of the Chief Quality Officer Group) and
subject matter specialists. This integrated, collaborative relationship fosters
organizational efforts to reduce risks to patients and improve the quality of care
through fundamental principles and practices incorporated into healthcare
delivery. Though QA, risk management, and patient safety personnel collaborate
to reduce healthcare risk, each has distinct functions and activities as described
here.

The Joint Commission Sentinel Event Definitions
20   P a g e
Page 96 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

A sentinel event is an unanticipated occurrence involving death or serious
physical or psychological injury. Serious physical injury specifically includes loss
of limb or function. Such events are called sentinel because they signal the need
for immediate investigation and response. Each hospital establishes an
operational definition of a sentinel event that includes at least
a. an unanticipated death, including, but not limited to,
• death that is unrelated to the natural course of the patient’s illness or
underlying condition (for example, death from a postoperative
infection or a hospital-acquired pulmonary embolism);
• death of a full-term infant; and
• suicide;
b) major permanent loss of function unrelated to the patient’s natural course of
illness or underlying condition;
c) wrong-site, wrong-procedure, wrong-patient surgery;
d) transmission of a chronic or fatal disease or illness as a result of infusing blood
or blood products or transplanting contaminated organs or tissues;
e) infant abduction or an infant sent home with the wrong parents; and
f) rape, workplace violence such as assault (leading to death or permanent loss of
function); or homicide (willful killing) of a patient, staff member, practitioner,
medical student, trainee, visitor, or vendor while on hospital property.

The hospital’s definition of a sentinel event includes a) through f) above and may
include other events as required by laws or regulations or viewed by the hospital
as appropriate to add to its list of sentinel events. All events that meet the definition
of sentinel event must be assessed by performing a credible root cause analysis.
Accurate details of the event are essential to a credible root cause analysis thus
the root cause analysis needs to be performed as soon after the event as possible.
The analysis and action plan is completed within 45 days of the event or becoming
aware of the event.
The goal of performing a root cause analysis is for the hospital to better understand
the origins of the event. When the root cause analysis reveals that systems
improvements or other actions can prevent or reduce the risk of such sentinel
events from recurring, the hospital redesigns the processes and takes whatever
other actions are appropriate to do so. It is important to note that the terms sentinel
event and medical error are not synonymous. Not all errors result in a sentinel
21   P a g e
Page 97 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

event, nor does a sentinel event occur only as a result of an error. Identifying an
incident as a sentinel event is not an indicator of legal liability.
b. The management of adverse events, near misses, or unsafe conditions, is a
component of the CQO. The program encompasses identification and mitigation
of risk to patients, family members, visitors, and staff as well as the oversight and
review of the effectiveness of organizational risk reduction strategies.
2. IDENTIFICATION OF ADVERSE EVENT, NEAR MISS, OR UNSAFE
CONDITION
a. Processes must be in place to identify all adverse events. Immediate action must
be taken to make sure those patients, staff, and visitors are protected from
additional injury and to minimize the effects of the event. All adverse events, near
misses, or unsafe conditions, must be entered in the patient safety reporting
system (EMERS).

REPORTS AND INTERVENTION
PROBLEM-PRONE AREAS

TECHNIQUES

FOR

MONITORING

a. Patient Safety Reports
(1) Patient Safety Reports will be submitted to the Chief Quality Officer. The data,
information, and format will be in accordance with CQO guidance.
(2) In order to facilitate timely and accurate reports and analysis, information
submitted to the CQO will include identification of the reporting facility. All personal
patient and individual provider information will be redacted before being sent to the
Chief Quality Officer.
b. EMERS:
(1) EMERS is a standardized, automated reporting system which allows all users
across each facility the ability to report, aggregate, and analyze adverse events.
(2) All adverse events, near misses, or unsafe conditions must be reported to the
EMERS.
c. Proactive Risk Assessment (PRA)
(1) Requirement to Complete a PRA. Productive Risk Assessment is a process for
the analysis and improvement of any at-risk system process. John H. Stroger Jr.
Hospital will complete a PRA on a high-risk process in accordance with
22   P a g e
Page 98 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

requirements established by The Joint Commission and individual organizational
guidance. PRAs may be conducted at any time and are appropriate for all
processes
(2) PRA Submission
(a) Submit each PRA to the regulatory affairs and accreditation director staff within
30 days of completion. The regulatory affairs and accreditation director staff must
forward all completed PRAs to the Hospital Oversight Committee within 45
calendar days of receipt from the facility. The reporting facility will be fully identified
and included on the PRA. Any requests for additional or clarifying information
required from the facility by the HQIPS committee will be coordinated through the
regulatory affairs and accreditation director staff.
(b) PRA materials produced are not intended for public release and must be
maintained as confidential records

Tools for Conducting a Proactive Risk Assessment
A number of tools are available to help conduct a proactive risk
assessment. One of the best known of these tools is the Failure Modes and Effects
Analysis (FMEA). An FMEA is used to prospectively examine how failures could
occur during high-risk processes and, ultimately, how to prevent them. The FMEA
asks “What if?” to explore what could happen if a failure occurs at particular steps
in a process.
Hospitals have other tools they can consider using in their proactive risk
assessment.
Some examples include the following:
• Institute for Safe Medication Practices Medication Safety Risk Assessment:
This tool is designed to help reduce medication errors. Visit
https://www.ismp.org/ self-assessments/default.asp for more information.
• Contingency diagram: The contingency diagram uses brainstorming to
generate a list of problems that could arise from a process. Visit
http://healthit.ahrq.gov/health-it-tools-and-resources/workflowassessment-health-it-toolkit/all-workflowtools/contingency-diagram
for
more information.
• Potential problem analysis (PPA) is a systematic method for determining
what could go wrong in a plan under development. The problem causes are
rated according to their likelihood of occurrence and the severity of their
consequences.
• Process decision program chart (PDPC) provides a systematic means of
finding errors with a plan while it is being created. After potential issues are
23   P a g e
Page 99 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

found, preventive measures are developed allowing the problems to either
be avoided or contingency plan to be in place should the error occur.
d. Root Cause Analysis

(1) An RCA is used to identify the basic or causal factors that underlie variation in
performance, including the occurrence or possible occurrence of an SE. RCA
focuses on systems and processes, not individual performance.
(2) Patient Safety RCA data are used internally for improving healthcare systems
and processes that impact quality and patient safety. At all levels of the
organization, information obtained through a Patient Safety RCA, to the greatest
extent possible, will not be used in adverse administrative, privileging, or other
personnel actions, including disciplinary action. In cases where possible
disciplinary action could result, the HQIPS committee will conduct two separate
and independent investigations.
(3) An RCA must be completed by the facility on all SEs, including TJC reviewable
SEs, within 45 calendar days of the facility becoming aware (i.e. discovery) of the
SE. Extensions for reviewable RCA completion will not ordinarily exceed 90
calendar days. RCAs conducted on non-reviewable SEs or other less serious
events should be completed as soon as practicable or as dictated by the respective
facility CEO.
(4) RCA Submission
(a) Electronic or hard copies of RCAs from SEs should reach the CQO not later
than 45 days after discovery of the event. The data provided must not contain any
identifying information related to the patient(s) or the individual healthcare
provider(s). The reporting facility identification will be included on the RCA. These
copies must be maintained as confidential CQO records.
(b) Copies of additional updates or changes to the RCA (such as those required
by TJC, CQO or the Board of Directors) will be forwarded through the CMO to
CQO within 30 days of completion. Any requests for additional or clarifying
information required from the facility by CQO will be coordinated through the CMO.

e. Notification

24   P a g e
Page 100 of 140

 JOHN H. STROGER JR. HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY PLAN OF
CARE

(1) John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County adopts TJC’s list of reviewable
SEs.
(2) All adverse events, including near misses and unsafe conditions will be
reported within the EMERS. CMO will be notified within 24 hours of the facility
learning of a TJC reviewable SE or other SE involving serious harm to a patient.
The CMO will report such SEs. The report will include the event type or category,
facility identification, date of event discovery, brief summary of the event, date the
RCA was chartered, the CMO point of contact and any unique identifiers or codes
for the report.
f. Intentional Unsafe Acts
(1) The investigation and consideration of corrective actions on intentional unsafe
acts are not within the primary authority or responsibility of the CQO. If in the
course of the activities of the EMERS information about intentional unsafe acts is
revealed, the original report must be referred to CEO for criminal investigation and
action as appropriate. Primary authority to investigate and consider corrective
actions on the matter must be outside of the CQO.
(2) Some events meet the definitions of both “adverse events” and “intentional
unsafe acts.” When an event appears to be both an “adverse event” and an
“intentional unsafe act,” primary authority and responsibility is outside the CQO.
The CQO must proceed with a review, including an RCA, if applicable, of the
systems and processes of the facility implicated in the actual or potential intentional
unsafe act, but will defer to the separate investigation and consideration on any
matter of responsibility of any person involved in the act.

COMMUNICATION WITH PATIENTS AND FAMILIES/PATIENT’S RIGHT TO BE
HEARD
1. GENERAL. This section describes a patient’s right to be heard in any HQIPS
program review of care provided by a facility.
2. PATIENT’S OPPORTUNITY. Any patient who believes he or she suffered a
personal injury due to a perceived failure of a facility to provide quality medical
care must have the right to submit his or her concerns as part of a QA review of
the care provided.

25   P a g e

CARE

3. PROCEDURES
a. The CEO or designee will ensure that the patient has notice of this opportunity
and must advise the patient whether the opportunity must be through personal
presentation or written presentation.
b. The opportunity provided in accordance with this section may be provided in
association with the healthcare resolutions program in accordance with John H.
Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County policy. However, the opportunity must be
provided without regard to whether the healthcare resolutions program is involved
and without regard to whether the patient has filed a claim for compensation or
retained legal counsel.
c. A patient is entitled to the assistance of legal counsel of the patient’s choosing
not at government expense.
d. In the case of a patient’s death or incapacitation, or if the patient is a child, the
opportunity to submit concerns must be available to the next of kin or other close
family member.
e. In any case in which a patient (or legal representative) submits concerns in
accordance with this enclosure, those concerns must be considered as part of a
QA review of the care provided. However, the results of any QA review are
protected in accordance with policy.
f. Patients and families are encouraged to express safety concerns by speaking
directly with front-line clinicians, department managers or patient relations
representatives.
