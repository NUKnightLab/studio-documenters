which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value,
including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage
to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in
such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the
total square footage of the improvements on the parcel. Such real estate must be
either obtained through the Cook County Tax Reactivation Project or must be
located in one of the following designated geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization

b.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom; Bremen; Calumet;
Rich; and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned
property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may
be, may still determine that special circumstances justify that the property is
deemed abandoned for purpose of Class 8. The finding of abandonment, along
with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. Not
withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to
justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where: A.) there has been a
purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or B.) there has been no purchase for value
and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for less than
24 continuous months.
Such resolution or ordinance shall be filed with the eligibility application. If the
ordinance or resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a resolution to that effect shall be
included with the Class 8 eligibility application filed with the Assessor.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of
abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County
Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances
justify that the property is deemed abandoned for purpose of Class 8. The
finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the resolution or ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. Not withstanding
the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify
finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where: A.) there has been
a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been
vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or B.) there has been no
purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 12 continuous months.

c.

A copy of any resolution received will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to
the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board
from the affected districts.

d.

For industrial and commercial properties this classification shall continue for a
period of 12 years from the date of new construction (excluding demolition, if
any) or substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in the
case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy. During the
tenth year, an application may be filed with the Assessor's Office for renewal of
the incentive for an additional ten year period. This incentive may be renewed
during the last year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the
following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial or commercial use of the property
is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class 8; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent
assessment level period.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of
the County Board from the affected districts. If, on November 23, 1999, a
property is receiving Class 8 treatment, but the assessment level is higher than 16
percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and
approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, on that effective
date the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is
granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the
current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted.

e.

Any property which has applied for Class 8 treatment at the time November 23,
1999, will be eligible for renewal based on the requirements of Subsection (11)
of this section. The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the
property properly applies for and qualifies for Class 8. If no renewal is obtained,
the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 7464. After expiration of the last incentive period the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

f.

Reserved.

g.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure
proper review of the application, supporting data and all other pertinent factors.

h.

The certification of an area as in need of substantial revitalization shall expire
five years from the date such certification is granted. The Assessor shall notify
the applicant of the date of expiration of certification one year before the date of
the expiration of the certification. Such certification, pursuant to the same
criteria, may be extended for one additional five-year period subject to
reapplication by the appropriate local governing body within the period from one
year to six months prior to the expiration of the initial five-year period.

i.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports
by all Class 8 recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 8 site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of
the incentive for the period covered by the nonfiling.

Effective date: This amended Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

and
MARIA DE LOURDES COSS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with ProWest and Associates, Walker, Minnesota, for an inventory compilation of various cultural features
associated with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) layers.
Reason:

Pro-West and Associates was selected through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process. The
firm was judged to be the most qualified of the firms which submitted proposals. Cultural
features are facility locations such as schools (public and private), day care facilities,
churches, parks, cemeteries, hospitals and other publicly held facilities. An accurate and
current GIS inventory of these features will be of great value to the County and local
jurisdictions for compliance with laws and Ordinances which reference distance requirements
in relation to these cultural features. The County will realize a savings of $88,320.00 as part
of the best and final offer negotiations.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $311,680.00 (FY 2013: $285,707.00; and FY 2014: $25,973.00). Contract
period: January 2, 2013 through January 1, 2014. (545-260 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the Geographic Information Systems Fund.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

tax, Parking Lot and Operations tax, and Amusement tax which included a one-time payment of back
taxes totaling $9.5 million, offsetting a continued reduction in Clerk of Circuit Court fees, CCHHS
patient fees and Alcoholic Beverage tax.

 FEES

TREASURER – Total eleven month actual revenue of $85.3 million was above budgeted revenue of
$56.2 million, and resulted in favorable variance of $29.1 million or 51.78%, based on current
economic conditions, 6% Inheritance Tax Commission earned on Inheritance tax collections and
Scavenger Sale overbids collected at the bi-annual scavenger sale.
CLERK OF CIRCUIT COURT – Total eleven month actual revenue of $87.3 million was behind
budgeted revenue of $94.8 million, and resulted in unfavorable variance of ($7.5) million or (7.97%).
This is primarily due to the reduction in the number of cases filed compared to the past three
years. The reduction is due to the increase use of red light cameras and the shifting of court cases to
municipal administrative hearings which results in decreasing the County revenue.
CCHHS – Total eleven month actual Patient Fee revenue is $257.9 million and is behind budgeted
revenue of $334.2 million, and resulted in an unfavorable variance of ($76.3) million or (22.83%)
through October 31, 2012. In comparison of October 31, 2012 Patient Fee revenue to September 30,
2012 Patient Fee revenue, CCHHS had a $64.4 million negative variance resulting in a total
unfavorable variance of $11.9 million for Patient Fee revenue. However the overall unfavorable
variance in Patient Fee revenue was partially offset by a favorable variance in DSH (Disproportionate
Share Hospital), giving CCHHS a total negative variance of $46.6 million through October 31, 2012.
The System CEO and his management team are working closely together to improve billing processes
to improve better revenue collections, and exploring other sources of revenue. The System CEO and
his management team meet weekly to review revenue activity, has monthly meetings with the State of
Illinois to discuss reduction of Medicaid application backlogs, and work together on implementing other
revenue enhancing initiatives such as physician billing.
Note 1: On June 26, 2012 County received $15.0 million in connection with the transfer of funds to
comply with intergovernmental agreement for special State fiscal year 2009 and 2010 year-end
payments. These payments are in recognition of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS’s) DSH Rules
that allows funds left over from the State Fiscal Year (SFY) annual DSH allotments to be paid to Cook
County Hospitals for services provided in fiscal years 2009 and 2010.
Note 2: On October 31, 2012 County received $4.8 million in connection with the transfer of funds to
comply with intergovernmental agreement for Federal fiscal years 2008 through 2011 disproportionate
share reconciliation. These payments are the result of a Disproportionate Share Reconciliation in
recognition of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS’s) DSH Rules that allows funds left over from the
State Fiscal Year (SFY) annual DSH allotments to be paid to Cook County Hospitals for services
provided in Federal Fiscal years 2008 through 2011. This brings the total additional DSH allotments to
$19.8 million.
HOME RULE TAXES
The County Sales Tax revenue of $421.9 million through the period October 31, 2012 was above
budgeted revenue of $413.1 million, and resulted in favorable variance of $8.8 million or 2.12%. This
represents a $.1 million unfavorable variance compare to $8.9 million for the period ended September
30, 2012 mainly due to change in consumer spending. For more current data see Exhibit I – Page 9.
The Final Sales Tax actual revenue of $458.2 million was above budgeted revenue of $448.8
million, and resulted in favorable variance of $9.4 million or 2.09%.

ii

 The County Parking Lot and Garage Operations Tax actual revenue of $36.1 million is above the
budgeted revenue of $33.4 million, and resulted in a favorable variance of $2.7 million or 8.11%
through the period ended October 31, 2012. The positive variance was mostly due to increased
enforcement activities conducted by the Department of Revenue.
The County Alcoholic Beverage Tax actual revenue of $30.8 million fell below the budgeted revenue
of $34.2 million, and resulted in unfavorable variance of ($3.4) million or (9.90%) through the period
ended October 31, 2012, based on current collections and seasonal impact. The variance occurred
mostly as a result of the revenue shortfall experienced in the first quarter. DOR is continuing to monitor
the collection rate and variance factors.
The County Amusement Tax actual revenue of $31.4 million is significantly higher than budgeted
revenue of $22.3 million, resulted in favorable variance of $9.1 million or 40.73% through the period
ending October 31, 2012. This was mainly due to one-time payments for back taxes.
The County Non Retailer Transaction Tax is currently under implementation and is set to begin in
October 2012 for November 2012 collections.
The Bureau of Finance continues to work with the various departments on planning and analysis to
identify opportunities to improve performance versus budget and operate more efficiently.

 Notes to the October 2012 Revenue Report:
1) Fees are projected to be received ratably, on a monthly basis, except for (a) patient
fees which are based on a historical pattern of cash receipts for the period reported,
established at the beginning of the fiscal year, and (b) IGT receipts which are based
on a State agreement. The budgeted IGT Medicaid receipt payment in the amount of
$37.5 million was received on November 19th 2012. The budgeted IGT Medicaid
receipt payment in the amount of $93.7 million was received on August 22nd 2012.
Certain other fee revenues for October 2012 have been accrued to account for
timing differences between departmental receipt and reporting to the Bureau of
Finance.
2) Home rule taxes are projected to be received ratably, on a monthly basis, except for
sales tax revenues, which are based on a historical pattern of cash receipts for the
period.
3) Inter-governmental revenues are projected to be received ratably, on a monthly
basis, except for (a) motor fuel tax grant transfers which are recognized on a
discretionary basis as amounts are transferred, and b) probation officer
reimbursements from the State which are projected for the period based on vouchers
submitted, and limited to the total amount of the State grant.
4) Other revenues are primarily projected as those revenues are expected to be
realized.
Property taxes represent the fiscal 2012 levy to be collected in fiscal year 2013. For
purposes of this report, property taxes are recognized ratably, on a monthly basis.
Treasurer fees, home rule taxes (except sales taxes) and certain other miscellaneous
fees are presented as reported by the monthly “Cook County Treasurer–Analysis of
Revenue” communication to the Office of the Comptroller.
