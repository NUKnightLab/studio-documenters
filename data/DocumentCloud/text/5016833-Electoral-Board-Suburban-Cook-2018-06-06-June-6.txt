monitoring devices.
Track Group, Inc. will provide GPS monitoring equipment and services for adult probationers and pretrial
defendants in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773, also known as the Cindy Bischof Law, which calls
for the monitoring of certain domestic violence offenses to be monitored by the Adult Probation
Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of bail or probation. Offenders are ordered to wear a
GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with orders to stay away from the complaining witness,
the complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any other protected address specified. There are currently
more than 350 adults under GPS monitoring and 110 victims who carry GPS devices to create mobile
exclusion zones. Effective January 1, 2015, new legislation (Public Act 98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5)
significantly expanded the types of charges required to be considered for GPS monitoring as a condition of
bail.
GPS technology is used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor high-risk
minors in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as condition of release into the
community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from pre-adjudication
through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the
Cook County Procurement Code. Track Group, Inc. was selected based on established evaluation criteria.
