Ms. Besenhofer provided an overview of the requests presented for the Committee’s consideration.

The

Ms. Besenhofer indicated that review of several of the requests by Contract Compliance has not yet been
completed; she respectfully requested that the Committee conditionally approve these requests, pending the
completion of review by Contract Compliance.
Peter Daniels, Chief Operating Officer of Hospital-Based Services, provided an introduction for request
number 1; John Cooke and Tony Dover, of the Cook County Office of Capital Planning and Policy, provided
additional information on the matter.
During the discussion of request number 10, Board Chairman Hammock requested information on the range of
pricing of the other responders to the RFP, and regarding the time frame for the posting of an RFP in general.
With regard to his first question regarding pricing of the other responders, Ms. Besenhofer said that she can
provide that information after the meeting, as she did not have it at hand. With regard to the time frame for
posting RFPs, she stated that it depends. Typically, they are posted for 30 days; if the product or service need
is more simplistic, it could be posted for 14 days. Sometimes, if the matter is more complicated, it will be
posted for a longer period of time. Recently, the posting of a particular RFP was extended, as staff received
more than 60 multi-part questions that needed to be answered by individuals throughout the organization;
following that, the questions and responses needed to be posted as an amendment to the RFP proposal, so that
responders could better validate their proposals.
Director Butler, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 28, subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance where
appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Note: at the January 30, 2015 Meeting of the CCHHS Board of Directors, request
numbers 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 26, under the Contracts and Procurement

few remaining issues that are being addressed. He expects that Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs)
affecting the System will get signed before audit statements are issued. The CBAs will have a retroactive
impact on 2013 and 2014; in order to make a provision for that, the administration is getting the advice of the
County negotiators as to what they expect that number to be.

VI. Strategic Issue Review


Remote Hosting Overview (Attachment #7)
Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the presentation on Remote Hosting. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.



Update on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #8)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, reviewed the information contained in the Update on the
CountyCare Health Plan. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Mr. Glass noted that, on slide 4, there is an error in the Benchmark/Target column; the sum of the categories
does not equal the Monthly Membership total.
The Committee discussed the subject of the redetermination process. Director Butler inquired as to the process
when the individual is a detainee at the Cook County Department of Corrections. Mr. Glass responded that
those populations are unique in the Medicaid world; he stated that, when someone is incarcerated, their
Medicaid coverage is suspended for the time period that they are incarcerated. If the individual comes up for
redetermination during that suspension, they would similarly have to go through the redetermination process;
until recently, this happened at discharge. As of January, due to a change in State law, now an individual can
apply at any time while they are incarcerated. Mr. Glass stated that the goal now is to identify people 60 or 90
days in advance of their discharge to make sure their applications are getting in, so their coverage is effective
at the time of their discharge. In response to a question from Mr. Scheer regarding detainees at the Cook
County Department of Corrections who purchase private commercial insurance under the marketplace, Mr.
Glass stated that he was unsure as to the details under those circumstances; the answer may be affected by
whether or not the individual receives a government subsidy.
Director Butler requested that staff prepare a report on the redetermination process2, to educate the Committee.
Mr. Glass indicated that this can be done. Director Junge inquired whether Mr. Glass can include the plan for
outreach and communication regarding the redetermination process. Mr. Glass responded affirmatively; next
month, the whole report on redetermination and the System’s approach will be presented. Director Wiese
inquired whether information on the subject of spenddowns can be included. Mr. Glass responded
affirmatively.
Mr. Scheer stated that there will be a large signup of Family Health Plan (FHP) members during the course of
the year. He inquired whether information can be included as one table that indicates costs by category of
eligibility. Mr. Glass responded affirmatively. He cautioned that this data will be based on claims, which can
take anywhere from 9 to 18 months to be received.
Mr. Glass informed the Committee that information has been informally received regarding the possibility of
cuts to per-member per-month (PMPM) payments. According to the information received, the State is going
to be reviewing the rates for Seniors and Persons with Disabilities; there were no further details provided, but
some kind of cut to those PMPM payments could be expected.



Miscellaneous Update
Mr. Elwell provided information regarding a potential strategic initiative that is being considered by the
administration. The System used to have major rehabilitation services and nursing home facilities at Oak
Forest. Over the next few months, the administration will be looking at the possibility of acquiring the
operations of some nursing homes.

Re: Purchase of Reinsurance for CountyCa re Health Plan

Since the inception of CountyCare, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System has purchased first-
dollar reinsurance to offset the risk of organ and blood cell transplantation for CountyCare members. Currently,
39 members have been identified and being tracked for transplant procedures. Since inception, less than a
dozen members have had blood cell transplants, and no members have had an organ transplant during to date.

For 2015, CountyCare leadership is recommending a change from first?dollar transplant coverage, to a per
member general stop loss policy. Working with the County?s insurance broker, Mesirow Financial, we have
drafted the following terms:

I $750,000 per member deductible

0 90% reinsurance once deductible is met; 52 million maximum benefit

0 Costs are calculated at 100% of Medicaid for providers and at 29% of charges (com parable
to standard Medicaid rates) for services provided at 

a Blood factor products, blood derivatives and anti-inhibitor coagulant complex excluded for one member

a Minimum $1 million annual premium

This memo requests the Board?s approval of payment not to exceed $1,194,245 for the purchase of re-
insurance as described above for CountyCare members. Coverage is priced on a PMPM basis by population
type FHP, SPD, ACA Adults). cost for reinsurance was $3,978,000. budget is $5,150,653. The
coverage to be purchased will again be provided by PartnerRe, as placed by the County?s broker, Mesirow
Financial.

Background: Medicaid is ?nanced jointly by the Federal government and each state participating in the
Medicaid program. The federal contribution to each state?s program is determined by a federal matching
rate called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage. or Illinois? federal match rate is 50
percent. A state has considerable ?exibility with respect to how it finances its share of Medicaid. For
instance. a state may use its own tax revenue or debt as permitted sources of Medicaid financing. Local
governments may also contribute to the state's share of its Medicaid expenditures. To trigger federal
Medicaid matching funds. a state must first expend some combination of state and local funds on
Medicaid.

In order to avoid reducing their Medicaid programs through eligibility cuts or benefit reductions. many
states. including Illinois. have historically used contributions from local governments. as permitted under
federal law. to finance a portion of the States' Medicaid programs. One mechanism used by Illinois to

facilitate this local government contribution has been an intergovernmental transfer HGT).

An IGT is a transfer of public funds from one level of government to another (cg. from the county to
the state} or between agencies at the same level of government one state agency to another). IGTs
have been an instrumental component of public finance for decades. Illinois and many other states have
come to rely on IGTs to fund a significant portion of their Medicaid programs. as permitted by federal
law. Illinois has had two main ongoing IGT agreements for Medicaid financing: one with Cook County.

Illinois (County) and one with the University of Illinois.

Beginning in I992. between the County and the State provided a financing mechanism allowing
Illinois to obtain federal Medicaid matching dollars to assist in funding its Medicaid programs. The
IGAs between the County and Illinois were amended from time to time based upon the various ?nancing
mechanisms permitted by federal law in place at the time. Essentially. the IGT financing mechanisms
outlined in these prior involved an arrangement whereby the County would transfer an agreed
upon amount to the State?s "County Provider Trust Fund." Under federal law. this amount was credited
to the State's non-federal 50% share of reimbursement due the health care facilities operated by the
County for Medicaid serviecs. The amounts due were based primarily on the State's share of Medicaid
payments to County providers. The federal government would then match this amount providing the

other 50% of the Medicaid reimbursement due the health care facilities Operated by the County.

Proposed IGA. The proposed before the Finance Committee recognizes that 

Medicaid ?nancing has signi?cantly changed with the advent of Medicaid managed care in Illinois. and
in Cook COunty. in particular. The health facilities operated by the County will no longer receive the
majority of their Medicaid reimbursement based upon fec-for-service costs. The County. through
now operates a health plan. CountyCare. a County MCCN. which enrolls eligible Illinois
Medicaid clients as members. CountyCare receives an actuariatly sound capitated per-member-per-
month rate with the State for care delivered to CountyCarc members. The health facilities operated by
are providers within CountyCare. The State has moved to mandatory managed care in Cook

County which leaves relatively small amounts of fee-for-service.

As described above. Medicaid services provided to Medicaid clients who reside in Cook County have.
historically. been supported with funds from the County. the State and the Federal government. The
County. through HS. and the State are committed to continuing this sharing of fiscal responsibility
in the best interests of continuing to provide access to quality health care to the residents of the County
through the State's Medicaid programs. As a substantial proportion of Medicaid clients who reside in
the County transition to managed care with its capitated rates. both the County. through and

the State must ensure that their financial support follows these clients into managed care.

Accordingly. the proposed IGA. as permitted by federal law. provides for the County?s local
government contribution of twelve (l2) $1 I million dollar transfers in addition to other transfers. The
total amount to be transferred by the County to the State under the proposed 10A is equivalent to the
$132 million contributed by the County to the State in 20M by way ofthe terms ofthe IGA in place at
that time. When approved. the proposed will be effective July I. 2014. Any substantial subsequent

change to this will be presented to the System Board for approval.

Thank you.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.

distribution of this report, this count has not been calculated. When the data becomes available, it will be reported.
