NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING

A public hearing will be held by the City Planning Commission in the Enna L. Henderson
Auditorium, 13?ll ?oor of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, on

THURSDAY. NOVEMBER 21,3019 AT 6:15 PM

to consider a text amendment to the Detroit Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 50 of the 2019 Detroit
City Code, to delete regulations relative to on-premises business signs, off-premises advertising
signs, directional signs, and temporary signs, consistent with a companion ordinance to
consolidate most sign regulations in Chapter 4 of the 2019 Detroit City Code, Advertising and
Signs.

This ordinance would repeal the following:

The entirety of Article VI of the Zoning Ordinance, which includes de?nitions and
procedures, and regulates the permissibility and dimensional features of signs according
to zoning district and overlay classi?cation.

This ordinance would amend the following:

0 Signs would no longer be reviewed as part of site plan review (Article 111, Division 5,
13. ?50-3-135, ?50-3-l80).

- City Council would no longer have ?Special District Review? authority to
review/approve signs on land zoned PC (Public Center) and PCA (Public Center
Adjacent?Restricted Central Business District) (?50-1 1-66 and ?50-11-96). The City
Planning Commission?s authority to review such signs is similarly removed.

- Explicit prohibitions of advertising signs are stricken:
0 PC and PCA Districts (?50-3-22 7, ?50-}1-66, ?50-1 1-96).
0 Grand Boulevard Overlay Area (?50-6?85, ?40-1 1-442).
0 Gateway Radial Thoroughfare Area (393041-364).

- Temporary sign permit provisions are removed (5950-4-22. 58?50-12-534, 
and are revised in Chapter 4.

The Board of Zoning Appeals would no longer have authority over variances related to
signs or over nonconforming signs (?50-4-131, ?50?15-26, 5930-15-30) a different appeal
and amortization process is provided in Chapter 4.

0 Enforcement authority over sign?related blight violations is removed from Zoning and
moved to Chapter 4 (?50-5-24, ?50-5-31); however, state law does not presently allow

for sign violations to be treated as blight violations outside of the Zoning Ordinance
(MCL 11 7. 

0 Speci?c limits on signage at bed and breakfast inns, gas stations, used car lots, and home
occupations are stricken (?50-12?216, ?50-12-2 72, ?50-12-293, ?50?12-488) in favor of
generally applicable limits in Chapter 4.

0 De?nitions of numerous sign types are repealed (?50-16?383) and preserved or revised in
Chapter 4.

The proposed Zoning Ordinance text amendment is being considered by the City Planning
Commission in accordance with the provisions of Article Division 2 of the Detroit Zoning
Ordinance.

Zoning Ordinance text amendments require the approval of the City Council after a public
hearing and a?er receipt of a report and recommendation by the City Planning Commission. You
