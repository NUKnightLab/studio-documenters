1. 2016 Master Plan Implementation Review
• MH guided group through discussion/review of committee’s goals outlined in the 2016
Master Plan Implementation Matrix
• Ideas generated will be summarized by MH + staff and we’ll evaluate priorities for the year
at March GD meeting
2. Window Works update/discussion
• First installation launched at 2139 N. Damen (Samuel Schwindt)
• Storefront owner, artist, realtor were all friends of SSA so it was nice to troubleshoot any
issues with people we know well
• Making sure “for sale” signage is still visible means installations are probably smaller than
we had originally intented
• SSA Staff needs committee’s help reaching out to vacant store fronts – use information at
wickerparkbucktown.com/windowworks for outreach and copy GK to follow up
• Discussion about best process for cold outreach and staff time
• GK suggested that we talk about budgeting for WW going forward at Executive Committee
• David Ginople brought up doing simple window clings of historic photos and/or doing
installations in non-vacant storefronts and asked whether this fits into the current program
for Window Works
