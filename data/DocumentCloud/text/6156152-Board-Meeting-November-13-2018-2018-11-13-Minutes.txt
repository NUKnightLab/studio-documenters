(MWRD) following an extensive procurement. The proposals were evaluated by MWRD’s
selection advisory committee comprised of staff from Information and Technology, Engineering
and Procurement staff.

MWRD selected e-Builder to provide the required services after

determining that it had a user-friendly system, multiple relevant local municipal references,
instant availability of the required system components and on-going research and development
components. It was recommended that PBC adopt MRWD’s procurement process, requirements
and certain terms and conditions of MWRD’s contract with e-Builder as a means of promoting
