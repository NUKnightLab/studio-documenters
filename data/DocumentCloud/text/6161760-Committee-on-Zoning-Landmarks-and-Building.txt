Alderman Scott Waguespack
83-2 Community Shopping District to 83-3 Community Shopping District
The building at 1931 W Betmont is a six unit residentiat ptus two unit commerciat buitding
buitt by a devetoper, PSS Enterprises. The City fited a case against the developer,
general contractor, and the condo association because the buitding was buitt contrary to
ptans and in excess of the attowable floor area ratio. The city revoked pss Enterprises
general contractor's license and fined them over a huirdred thousand dottars. Havìng now
exhausted legal remedies for the ittegal. actions of the devetoper, the Department of
Laws recommended that we rezone the property so that the innocent purchasers can
legatize the buil.ding. subsequent to the approval of permits for the previousty ittegat
work, the Alderman will request that the zoning be returned to the prior ctassification.
