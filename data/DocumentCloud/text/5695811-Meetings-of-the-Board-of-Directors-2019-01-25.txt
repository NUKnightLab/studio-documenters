 SWT Analysis

 COOK COUNTY

HEALTH

 

SWOT Analysis – Federal
Strengths
•
•

•

Congressional delegation support
Good stories to tell - successful ACA implementation,
CountyCare growth and innovative work in areas related to
social determinants (food, housing, opioids) and justiceinvolved populations
Divided government means ACA repeal or major changes to
Medicaid unlikely

Opportunities
•
•
•

Medicaid waiver opportunities
Narrow, targeted legislation
Continue to demonstrate to federal partners that we are
successfully implementing the ACA (CountyCare), improving
outcomes and reducing disparities

Weaknesses
•
•

•

Vulnerable to reductions in federal support, especially
Medicaid
Major legislative improvements to federal health programs
unlikely
2020 election cycle

Threats
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Regulatory initiatives to restrict federal funding or limit
eligibility for programs, i.e. public charge
Pay-go rule in the House, budget neutrality guidance for
Medicaid 1115 waivers
Growth of federal deficit leading to calls for “entitlement
reform,” including restructuring Medicaid
Ongoing efforts to repeal ACA continue – Texas v. USA
Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funding cuts
Expanded cuts to outpatient services
Potential changes to the 340B Rx Program
Continued depletion of the Prevention & Public Health Fund
11

Capital Infrastructure Bill

Weaknesses
