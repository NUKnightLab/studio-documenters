UNIVERSOUL CIRCUS FOOD HANDLING PROCEDURES

FOOD PREPARATION:

Hot Dogs, Nachos, and Cheese Sauce are purchased at local food wholesaler. Hot Dogs are stored in
our freezer at temperatures of 30? or lower to keep them at a safe temperature to avoid
contamination of any type.

Hot Dogs are boiled in a GE Roaster Pan up to 450? to sewing temperature.

Buffalo wings are deep fried in buffalo wing fryer then transferred to a commercial grade ?Classic
APW by Wyott,? warmer.

These items are transferred from the freezer straight to their respective cooking pans and when ready
they are kept at a safe temperature above 140? until sold. The operator is responsible for checking
the temperature of the hot dogs and cheese.

Cheese Sauce, Nachos is purchased in cans and stored properly. The Cheese sauce is poured into the
cooking pan and it is heated up to 180? and kept at a temperature above 140? until served.

The funnel cake batter is prepared and kept in a plastic container. They are deep fried in the Funnel
Cake fryer once a customer has made an order.

All items used in the Concessions Area are kept 6 inches above the floor and properly stored in
plastic containers, and we require the use of food handling gloves for the preparation of any items
sold in the circus.

All hand washing stations are equipped with water, soap and paper towels.

In case of an emergency that requires evacuation (Fire, Sustained Winds, Power Outage,
Earthquake, Bomb Threat) the following describes the steps of the USC evacuation plan:

Alert In the event an emergency occurs the Emergency and Evacuation Director will notify
all department heads to take position and prepare for evacuation.

For weather related concerns, various weather channels, including a weather radio, are
monitored before and during threatening or active weather periods by the Director and
other support personnel. If Director determines that the weather pattern andlor current
conditions call for a cessation of activities (Box Of?ce Sales, lngress of Public, Promotions,
Performances, Rehearsals, etc.) at any point before the circus is open to the public, once the
circus is open to the public or during the Show, then the Director will notify all
necessary persons including department heads, local vendors, on-site First Responders,
landlord representatives, and media liaison to advise what measures need to be taken.

Big Top The Ring Master will notify the audience in a calm and relaxed fashion,
?Please follow the instructions of the usher closest to you in the aisles and stationed
at each exit. Stay calm and walk as you exit the tent.? (This notification will be made
by the use of our powered public address system. In case of power outage, this
noti?cation will be made by the designated Bull Ham located in the backstage area.)

Egress (1) One usher per exit and (4) Fireguards. In the event of an emergency,
ushers and ?reguards stationed at the exits will secure the tent fabric curtains in the

8.0 General Compound Safety

UniverSoul Circus Safety Plan Page 4 of 8

LII-WM UNIVERSOUL CIRCUS SAFETY PLAN

The objective is to secure the compound and protect the people, property, and reputation of
the UniverSoul Circus. All Public Safety Personnel should be easily identi?ed and be neat
and clean. Public Safety Personnel must maintain a courteous attitude at all times. In
some instances a ?rm but polite stance will be necessary. Rudeness, carelessness, and
playful behavior will not be tolerated. No eating, drinking, or smoking is allowed on posts.
Unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated on the grounds, on or off duty.

8.1 Twenty-four (24) Hour Posts

Public Safety Personnel must maintain a continuous surveillance of the property and
persons entering, exiting, and remaining on the compound. The surveillance of the
compound is made by a combination of stationary and roving posts, which is determined
per site, and created to provide the best possible coverage. Any deviation should be
cleared through the Operations Manager.

Entry points should be secured by a locked gate or a Public Safety Person. Credentials
should be checked of anyone entering the compound. Any person attempting to enter the
compound without a valid badge must be cleared through the Operations Manager. The
Operations Manager may provide clearance in person, via the radio, with a list, or a person
designated to allow others to enter the compound. As part of a program to avoid credential
loss, at random intervals, Public Safety Personnel will be asked to require all circus
personnel to produce credentials.

Regular deliveries and service calls must be channeled to the appropriate staff member or
area of the compound as soon as possible. For example, UPS may have frequent deliveries
for Concessions. Do not detain or delay deliveries or service calls unless the safety of the
public is a concern. Another example is the Federal Express driver may want to drive
through the courtyard to deliver several boxes after the UniverSoul Circus has opened to
the public. Because the courtyard may have several patrons, the Federal Express driver
will need to park at the closest Service Entrance and walk the delivery into the compound
or drive to the nearest Backstage Service Entrance and deliver the items. All service calls
and deliveries are to be announced or listed and completed during non-show time
whenever possible. Announcements may come in the form of a Memo or verbally, but
should be listed on the Delivery and Service Call Log.

Checking credentials requires that the Public Safety Personnel look care?illy at the
identifying marks of the tour pass. The front and back of the badge has certain
characteristics to indicate that it is a current and authentic UniverSoul Circus. All
personnel employed by the UNIVERSOUL CIRCUS and anyone entering the compound
as a Visitor must display or be issued a current badge. Anyone attempting to use an
expired or fake badge should be detained and the Operations Manager should be noti?ed
immediately.

8.2 Main Entrance and Ticket Gate

Main Entrance is the area in which the patrons enter and exit. The Ticket Gate is also the
main point of entry for Visitors during non-show times. The Public Safety Personnel
stationed at the gate will act as a ?lter for the UNIVERSOUL CIRCUS. The of?cer will

UniverSoul Circus Safety Plan Page 5 of 8

UNIVERSOUL CIRCUS SAFETY PLAN

 

need basic information, such as a person?s name, company and purpose of the visit so that
a brief radio transmission will have enough information for the person receiving the
transmission can respond with clear instructions.

8.3 Authorized Personnel Entrances

Gates are labeled as Authorized Personnel or Service Entrance, etc. These gates are for
deliveries, service calls, and badge access, and not for public entry unless otherwise noted
by the Director. Each Service Entrance should be marked with a sign such as
Authorized Personnel, Service Entrance as well as Fire Lane Do Not Block, 

Authorized Personnel Signs are posted throughout the facility. Access to these areas
requires a badge. Some delivery and service call personnel, such as the Ticketmaster
Technician, will need to gain access to those areas; however Public Safety should be aware
regarding service calls and deliveries.

8.4 Fire Lanes

Only emergency vehicles such as ambulances, ?re trucks, and police cars are allowed to
park in these areas. UNIVERSOUL CIRCUS even encourages that the drivers of those
vehicles park somewhere else. Press, VIPs, and Tour Staff are not allowed to park in these
areas. Loading and unloading is OK. by Press, VIPs, Vendors, and Staff, but should be
quick and directed elsewhere if it will affect the exiting or entry of patrons at that time.
Any exceptions should be made by the Director.

8.5 Show Time Public Safety

Several Public Safety Personnel (Ticket Takers, Ushers, EMS, etc.) are used during show
time for customer service and basic crowd control. Standing on the seats is not permitted
during the performances. Ushers stationed throughout the Performance Tent during the
performances will monitor the occupants and instruct anyone standing on a seat to step
down onto the walking surface.

8.6 Ticket Gate

All patrons entering the facility must have a ticket or be escorted onto the property by a
person with an ALL ACCESS badge. All bags of patrons entering the compound are
subject to inspection and patrons can be asked to open for an examination to locate items
prohibited by the UNIVERSOUL CIRCUS which include outside food and beverage,
unauthorized paraphernalia (glow necklaces, swords, and balloons), cameras, video
cameras, audio recording devices, guns, stun guns, knives, and other weapons. NEVER
TELL THE PUBLIC THAT SECURITY IS SEARCHING FOR WEAPONS, BOMBS,
ETC.

8.7 Backstage Entry

During shows Public Safety Personnel hold various posts to ensure that persons entering
the backstage area have the proper badge. All persons leaving the backstage area must
display their badges including children. All persons attempting to enter the backstage area
must display their badges. Any problems with UNIVERSOUL CIRCUS personnel should
be reported immediately to the Director.
