VOTING OPPORTUNITY AND TRANSLATION EQUITY ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, Cook County is committed to the values of equity, engagement, and excellence; and
WHEREAS, 35% of residents of Cook County speak a language other than English at home; and
WHEREAS, research suggests that civic engagement is a significant predictor of economic opportunity
across states; and
WHEREAS, the United States Congress found in Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, P.L.
94-73, 42 U.S.C. §1973aa-la, that, "through the use of various practices and procedures, citizens of
language minorities have been effectively excluded from participation in the electoral process;" and
WHEREAS, Cook County complies with the Voting Rights Act, which dictates which languages are
translated for ballots and voting materials; and
WHEREAS, the Voting Rights Act has not been updated since 1992, and only requires that covered
states or political subdivisions translate voting materials in English and for persons of American Indian,
Asian American, Alaskan Native or Spanish heritage who meet a threshold of 10,000 or more limited
English speakers. Additionally, state or political subdivisions are only required to evaluate these numbers
every ten years following the decennial census.
WHEREAS, research shows that targeted minority language voting materials and related outreach can
improve voter turnout. According to a report by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund,
after coverage provided under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was expanded in 1992, the
number of Asian Americans registered to vote increased dramatically. As cited in the journal Legislation
and Public Policy vol. 10:195 2006, "in covered areas where the Department of Justice brought section

dramatically;" and

choice, other than the voter's employer or agent of the employer or officer or agent of the voter's union;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Clerk serves as the chief election authority for the entire county, one of
the largest election jurisdictions in the nation; and 
WHEREAS, the right to vote is a fundamental principle of our democracy; and

BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, Chapter 34 - Finance, Article IV Procurement, Division 8 - Minority and Woman-Owned Business Enterprises, Section 34-297 - Contract

Sec. 34-297. - Contract Pre-Award Compliance Procedures.

(a) For all solicitations, the Contractor, Person, or Business shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all

Page 7 of 68

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

September 26, 2019

subcontractors from which the Contractor, Person, or Business solicited bids or quotations, and if Project
Specific Goals have been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The
Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid/proposal is due. Any Contractor, Person, or Business
requesting a partial or full waiver shall submit a Good Faith Effort Transparency Report with its Utilization
Plan when the Utilization Plan is due. In the event a bid or proposal leads to a Contract with the County,
the Utilization Plan as approved, and any Good Faith Effort Transparency Report as approved and
applicable, by the CCD shall be incorporated as a material commitment on the part of the Contractor,
Person, or Business to each relevant PCE, and the Contractor, Person, or Business, and the County.
Failure to include a Utilization Plan, and Good Faith Effort Transparency Report, where applicable, shall
render the bid or proposal not Responsive.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor, Person, or Business and a PCE in which the Contractor
requires that the PCE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor, Person, or Business cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CCD
will determine whether the Contractor, Person, or Business has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the
Goal(s), based upon the submission of a Good Faith Effort Transparency Report by the bidding Contractor,
Person, or Business and consideration of additional factors by the CCD, pursuant to Sections 34-281 and
34-282.
A Contractor, Person, or Business submitting bids or proposals for Procurements may in all
instances request a partial or full waiver of one or more established Project Specific Goal for PCE
participation. In making this determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, the Good Faith Effort
Transparency Report, pursuant to Section 34-281 and additional factors, pursuant to Section 34-282.
(d) In determining whether a Contractor, Person, or Business has made Good Faith Efforts, the
performance of other Contractors, Persons, or Businesses in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be
considered. For example, when the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business fails to meet the
Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned whether, with additional
reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business could have met the Project
Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business fails to meet the
Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Contractors,
Persons, or Businesses, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business
made Good Faith Efforts.
(e) A signed letter of intent from each listed PCE, describing the work, materials, equipment or
services to be performed or provided by the PCE and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due at the time
of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f) The CCD shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and
the letters of intent from PCEs. The CCD may request clarification in writing of items listed in the
Utilization Plan and/or the Good Faith Effort Transparency Report. provided such clarification shall not
include the opportunity to augment listed participation or augment or modify any Good Faith Effort
Transparency Report.

(g) If the CCD determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have
been achieved or accepts the Good Faith Efforts Transparency Report submitted, with the concurrence of
the User Agency, the CCD and User Agency shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent. The CCD
must issue a report to the Board pursuant to Section 34-283 upon acceptance of the Contractor’s Good
Faith Effort Transparency Report no later than one week three (3) days prior to the Board meeting where
the Contract seeks approval by the Board.
(h) If the CCD rejects the Contractor, Person, or Business’ Good Faith Effort Transparency Report,
the CCD shall communicate this finding to the Purchasing Department and recommend that the
bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest
procedures.
Effective date: This Ordinance Amendment shall be in effect September November 1, 2019.
