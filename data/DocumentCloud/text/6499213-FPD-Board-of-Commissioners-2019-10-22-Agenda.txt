Contract Value: $205,000.00

The contract-specific MWBE goal for this contract was set at zero.
District(s): Districtwide
Summary: The Forest Preserves originally entered into a contract with Active Network to provide permit
reservation services in 2013 and launched the system on 1/1/2014. The current contract expires on
12/31/2019. In spring 2019, the Forest Preserves issued a competitive RFP to select a new software
provider and again selected Active Network as the most responsive of the six (6) proposals.

This proposed new contract will allow the Forest Preserves to continue utilizing Active Network for
permit reservations and membership sales; however, the Permits, Rentals and Concessions Department
intends to rebuild the existing permit reservation interface to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction
by utilizing map reservation and other new features. The new system will be launched before 2021 permit
sales begin. The fiscal impact includes $70,000.00 for consultant support to rebuild the system in 2019 and
2020. Funding in subsequent years will be used to upgrade outdated equipment, including credit card
readers, and for consulting optimization services. The proposed fiscal impact excludes transaction fees
which are in the range of 2.25% to 3% (lower than the current contract).
Software agreements are often form agreements that apply to a general class of customer, which is the
case here as well. Thus, the proposed new contract includes some non-standard provisions for the Forest
Preserves. The RFP called for a four (4) year contract with two (2) optional two-year extensions;
however, this term has been modified to a two (2) year contract with four (4) optional two-year
extensions. While Active Network’s hourly consultant rates to the Forest Preserves are not fixed, Active
Network has agreed not to modify the transaction fees during the initial term and the first two-year
extension option. The Forest Preserves will be subject to an early termination fee if it terminates the
contract for convenience during the initial term or during a renewal term. The contract will be governed by

Page 5 of 17

BOARD AGENDA

October 22, 2019

a state law other than Illinois law (similar to the current contract with Active Network). The final
agreement will be subject to legal review and approval. Finally, the Forest Preserves’ current contract
with Active Network will terminate upon the Forest Preserves execution of this proposed new agreement
with Active Network.

The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Attorney have approved this item.

District(s): 4, 5, 6
Summary: The Forest Preserves is requesting an increase in the overall authority for this program to
continue service through the end of 2019. The program was partially funded by a grant Friends of the
Forest Preserves (“Friends”) obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency - Great Lakes
Restoration Initiative in the amount of $591,265.00. This grant expired in September 2019, and was not
renewed by the granting agency, thereby leaving a gap until the end of the program.

The Calumet Conservation Corps program is an employment program providing conservation and job skills
training for a ten (10) member field crew. The program engages a Crew Manager, an Assistant Crew
Manager, four (4) adult participants, as well as four (4) part time young adult Emerging Calumet Leader
interns in hands-on ecological restoration activities centered on herbicide application, prescribed fire, native
seed collection, and invasive species removal.
Ecological restoration will be conducted in partnership with the Forest Preserves, volunteers, community
members, and professional contractors to advance goals in support of stewardship projects and invasive
species management in the Calumet region, which harbors significant biological diversity but is threatened
by environmental justice issues.

an existing storm sewer license area and mowed areas. Tree removal is expected to be minimal or none
and will comply with the Forest Preserves’ Tree Mitigation Plan. The license fee, license application fee,
and the YELAR fee will be waived, per the usual practice for trail connection project requests from
municipalities. There is no cost to the Forest Preserves. Niles has funding for the design and construction
of the trail segments. The IGA constitutes a license for Niles to construct and maintain the trail in

Summary: On 10/1/2013, the Board of Commissioners authorized the Forest Preserves of Cook County
(the “Forest Preserves”) to enter into and execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) with the
Prairie Research Institute of the University of Illinois for the purpose of developing a Natural and Cultural
Resources Master Plan, and to perform work pursuant to that plan on an annual basis. The Plan was
completed in early 2015, and has successfully helped guide the allocation of resources and informed
strategies to pursue and meet the ambitious goals set forth in the Next Century Conservation Plan.

The Forest Preserves’ continued partnership with the Prairie Research Institute has resulted in the
development of numerous tools for successful execution of the plan and effective resource conservation
into the future. These tools and other major accomplishments are summarized in the Natural and Cultural
Resources Master Plan 2018 Summary Report, but include a detailed prioritization schematic for
restoration, a seed policy, and the development of standardizing protocols for long-term measurement of
conservation success.
The proposed extension will enable the University of Illinois and the Forest Preserves to continue to

Page 11 of 17

collaborate to meet the Forest Preserves’ needs for information and analysis in support of natural and
cultural resource management. Tasks will include, but are not limited to, the creation of web-based and
printed interpretive materials to provide easy-to-understand interpretation of science data that will engage
constituents and conservation partners. The University of Illinois will also assist the Forest Preserves with
advanced land cover and cultural resource mapping, continued field assessments of archaeological
resources, and classification of priority waterways to remedy impacts to key conservation lands.
The Forest Preserves would like to extend the aforementioned IGA with the University of Illinois for an
additional five (5) years.

PROPOSED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Forest Preserves”) to
enter into a Partnership Agreement with the Lake County Forest Preserve District, Libertyville, Illinois;
Citizens for Conservation, Barrington, Illinois; Friends of the Forest Preserves, Chicago, Illinois; the
Bobolink Foundation, Chicago, Illinois; and Great Lakes Audubon, Chicago, Illinois.
Reason: Cooperative restoration and management of natural areas within the Barrington Greenway
Initiative (“BGI”), a region of the Flint Creek Watershed which includes the following properties owned by
the Forest Preserves of Cook County: Crabtree Forest Preserve, Beverly Lake, Penny Road Pond, Spring
Lake Forest Preserve, and Spring Lake Nature Preserve.

Through this agreement, the partners may share and exchange resources and information to improve
management practices, and work jointly to secure grant funds and implement common management
objectives. This may involve collaboration on common ecological management activities for the protection
and management of the BGI, including fire management, invasive plant control, wildlife conservation and
nuisance wildlife management activities. Additionally, the partners may be able to share information on
land management techniques and effectiveness, as well as research and monitoring data relevant to
conservation threats.
By adopting a multi-agency collaborative approach, the partners intend to achieve a positive ecological
impact on the BGI ecosystem that is more efficient and cost effective than what they could achieve
working individually.
Contract period: The agreement shall remain perpetual at the discretion of the General Superintendent,
so long as a minimum of two (2) parties are participating. Any party shall have the right to withdraw from
the agreement by giving thirty (30) days written notice.
