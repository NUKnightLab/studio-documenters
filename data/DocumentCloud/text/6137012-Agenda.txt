County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution
expressly stating that it has determined the property is “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended
Class 6a and that it supports and consents to the Amended Class 6a application to the Assessor. A
certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Amended
Class 6a eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Amended Class 6a. If the

validating such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended
Class 6a need not be filed at the time of filing the Amended Class 6a application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the

the Assessor within 30 days if the retail center with grocery store component or the retail
development enterprise ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be
forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the
time established by the Assessor’s rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to

development enterprise ceases operations at that location, then the Amended Class 6a incentive
granted shall terminate.

grocery store component or from the date of such new construction (excluding demolition, if any)
regarding the retail development enterprise and will continue for a period of 12 years or until the
retail center with grocery store component or the retail development enterprise ceases operations at
that location if that occurs sooner.

i. The property can continue to be deemed “qualified” for the purposes of the Class 6a;
ii. The applicant notifies the Assessor’s Office of intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality or the County Board, if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;
iii. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the premise
continues to be deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a, and supports
and consents to renewal of the Amended Class 6a; and
iv. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the

property continues to be deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a.
j. A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to
the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the
affected districts.

Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Amended
Class 6a.

buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property,
including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square
footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the
parcel.
a.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application
to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is
not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter
from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance
supporting the incentive has been requested.
Page 7 of 24

 b.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

c.

Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new
construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to
abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior to the
commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

d.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b,
unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling
Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide
a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that
special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not
be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed
with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to
Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant
shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance where
real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if
there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification
of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is
that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect
shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist,
as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
Page 8 of 24

 property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the
Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a
minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to
continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused; and

3.

The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same
property.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special circumstances, and
a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial
enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be in
imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a
municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property
is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of
special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a
certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be
received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b incentives
granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its
operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER
Program shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy of
Page 9 of 24

 such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports
within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the nonfiling. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive granted
pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the
case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification shall continue for a period
of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the
premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this incentive may
be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent assessment level pursuant to
section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive from the
municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the
Class 6b; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's
Office before the expiration of the ten-percent assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are not
renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as
the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to
Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 6b
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the
period relating to the nonfiling.

a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the industrial or

through a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or operated the site, which
ownership or operation caused the contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site
remediation. A present owner who can successfully demonstrate that the owner was not responsible
for the contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly

municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class C application
to the Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution must be filed at the time of
application for the Class C classification. A copy of that ordinance or resolution, whichever is
submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to
the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be made
within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter." Where an application for Class
C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon
which remediation has been completed, the one year limitation will be waived for any subsequent
separate application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional portions of the
property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs, including site
investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring, and engineering and
legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively,
must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's
property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial and
commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a
property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the
Class C; and

Page 11 of 24

 3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and
qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the
adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this
renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the effected districts.

g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level is
higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is
higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no
reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no
renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section
74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to
the applicable classification under this division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine eligibility for
the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to
ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under the Class C classification.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class C
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class C site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(9)(10) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified commercial
development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need of
commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00,
consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are
situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property
is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such
rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies
when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of
land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation
bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a. The finding
of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7a application. Not withstanding the
foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed
"abandoned" where:
Page 12 of 24

 A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and a resolution to that
effect shall be included with the Class 7a eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy. After such 12-year
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7a
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7a site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(10)(11) Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this division, comprising
a qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an
"area in need of commercial development", where total development costs, exclusive of land, exceed
$2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon
which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent
such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land
qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The
amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the
rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b. The
finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7b application. Not
withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a
property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b and a resolution to that
effect shall be included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy.
Page 13 of 24

 c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7b
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7b site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(11)(12) Class 8. Real estate used primarily for industrial and commercial purposes, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned
property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has
added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

b.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square
footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the
parcel. Such real estate must be either obtained through the Cook County Tax Reactivation Project or
must be located in one of the following designated geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in accordance with the
provisions of Section 74-65(b);

2.

An enterprise community as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or
the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, and the municipality in which such real estate is
located, or, if in an unincorporated area, the County must by lawful Resolution determine that
such real estate is consistent with an overall plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or

3.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom; Bremen; Calumet; Rich; and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a
Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling
Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide
a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that
special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not
be filed at the time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 8. If
the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at that
time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.

 Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance where
real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8 under the TEERM Program, if there has been
no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 8 application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such
municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to

8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution
finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8
need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed with
the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 8.
If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at
that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before
November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
c.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

d.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in
the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of incentives
granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval.

e.

Unless it was granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, this incentive may be renewed during the
last year a property is entitled to a ten-percent assessment level pursuant to 74-64(11), if the
following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial or commercial use of the
property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal
of the Class 8; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's
Office before the expiration of the 10 percent assessment level period.

Page 15 of 24

 f.

Class 8 incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program are not renewable. For all other
Class 8 incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and meet the requirements for Class 8.

g.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

h.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to
Section 74-64(11). After expiration of the last incentive period the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

i.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 8.

j.

The certification of an area as in need of substantial revitalization shall expire five years from the
date such certification is granted. The Assessor shall notify the applicant of the date of expiration of
certification one year before the date of the expiration of the certification. Such certification,
pursuant to the same criteria, may be extended for one additional five-year period subject to
reapplication by the appropriate local governing body within the period from one year to six months
prior to the expiration of the initial five-year period.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 8
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 8 site. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the
period relating to the nonfiling.

8.

File annually with the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, for the duration
of the Class 9 classification period, a sworn statement verifying continuous compliance with the
Class 9 provisions of this division.

b.

No applicant shall discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, marital status, religion, national origin
or ancestry, or on any other basis prohibited under Federal, State or local law.

c.

Upon completion of the major rehabilitation, the applicant must supplement the application by
submitting evidence showing that major rehabilitation did, in fact, occur, the date that the major
rehabilitation was completed and that the real estate complies with all applicable local building,
safety and health requirements and codes. Upon completion of the new construction, the applicant

all applicable local building, safety and health requirements and codes.

d.

Beginning January 1, 2000, the Class 9 classification shall have an initial duration of ten years from
the date that the major rehabilitation was completed. That period may be extended for additional
ten-year periods if:

e.

1.

An application is filed with the Assessor at least 12 months before the expiration of the
incentive period;

2.

The applicant presents evidence that the real estate currently complies with all applicable local
building, safety and health requirements and codes; and

3.

When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is terminated by action of the owner or the
Assessor, the property owner shall, in a manner and form determined by the Assessor, notify all
Class 9 tenants of the date of the termination of Class 9 classification. Once the Class 9 classification
is terminated, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

(13)(14) Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division, consisting of land
and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract renewal. The
portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number of
Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied only to property used for
residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed pursuant to
one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market option, after
finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an inspection by
HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property is decent, safe,
sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS) violations;
Page 17 of 24

 ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot be
eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the
use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase the rents to the use
restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and

iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable market
rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under the mark up
to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property meets at least one
of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance difficult
to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a contribution of
state or local funds to the property.
3.

b.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation under any
available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal
Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low and
moderate-income persons.

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at least five
years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with the
Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement verifying
continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this division.

4.

Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is terminated prior
to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor's office a copy of any notice of
default or notice of abatement received from HUD.

c.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal, no less than 120 days prior to the
expiration of the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's Office of the application, on a
form provided by that office. Upon receiving approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the
applicant shall file an application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by
that office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter approving the contract
renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.

d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a mark up to
market option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 2001 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any
renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The classification shall continue until the
expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.

Page 18 of 24

 e.

f.

Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8 contract
renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any
renewals approved with the mark up to market option, mark up to market option under HUD's
discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation
under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of
the Section 8 contract.
The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the following
three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option under HUD's
discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's
renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an
application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to termination of the contract, for renewal of the
Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the Assessor's Office of its application for
renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the
contract renewal, or notification of other action.
The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under Class S.

(14)(15) Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is
designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this division; is a landmark or contributing
building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation must constitute an
investment by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market value as determined by the
Assessor in the assessment year prior to the commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land underneath the
building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous
months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor, the land upon which the
building is situated shall also be eligible for the incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain an
ordinance or resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is located, which
expressly states that the local government:

c.

d.

1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial
rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written recommendation of the
project for the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's budget and
proposed scope of work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards of
the United States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restoration, and
Reconstruction of historic properties.

A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the time the
Class L eligibility application is filed but the ordinance or resolution must be filed with the Assessor
no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.
If the ordinance or resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed, the applicant
shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:

Page 19 of 24

 1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a resolution or
ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested; and

2.

A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.

e.

A copy of the resolution or letter confirming that a resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for
distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L classification, an
eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of
substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has been completed, the preservation
commission shall review the project to determine that it is eligible under Subsection (14) of this
section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the determination of
the preservation commission prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such substantial
rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be renewed during
the last year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are
met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the
Class L; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify
for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts.
i.

If, as of November 23,1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment level is
higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is
higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no
reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no
renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section
74-64. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.
Page 20 of 24

 k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class L
recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of persons employed at
the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules may
result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

 Sec. 74-65. Qualifications for commercial development project status.
(a) To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the project be located
in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(1) The area is, or has been within the last ten years, designated by Federal, State or local agency as a
conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or
project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the
Commercial Renewal Re-development Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a
Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board
on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the Commercial District Development
Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or designation of like effect adopted under any similar
statute or ordinance;
(2) Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined, remained stagnant or potential
real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of the area;
(3) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted
Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the area;
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will materially assist
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the commercial development project would
not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or 7b; and
(5) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is reasonably expected
to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities within the
area.
(b) Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain from the
municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the
case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section are present and
that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7a or 7b
application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance or resolution shall be included with the Class 7a
or 7b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or resolution,
whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for
distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts. The application shall include any
other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the commercial
development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
(c) Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of the County,
support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of such applications, the
Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section for Class 7a
applications.
(d) The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application and
supporting data.
(e) Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient size if it
otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive offered" as provided in
Subsection (a)(4) of this section, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation
agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to
share a portion of future profits with the appropriate taxing districts.

 (f) For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this
section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this division.
(g) In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary supporting
data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County. The
Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section are present. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt
of the Committee's findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under
this division.
(h) Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new construction or
substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the commercial development
project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it is
necessary that:
(1) The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the County determine by
lawful resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible
for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the
area without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import;
(2) The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the
area as one in need of substantial revitalization;
(3) Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall
review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the
severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial
revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to
the fact that an area is located in a Federal empowerment zone or enterprise community, as proposed and
approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.

(j)

Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area. In making this
determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area for which certification
is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall be the community area as
defined in this division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which
the area is located.

(k) If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22,
1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal resolution that the area is in a
state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the
necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8 certification, such
certification shall be automatic pursuant to this division. However, each property eligible for a Class 8
incentive within the certified area must file an application in a timely manner.
(l)

Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is defined in this division. The
renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.
