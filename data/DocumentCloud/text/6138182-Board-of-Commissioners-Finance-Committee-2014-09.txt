PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COOK COUNTY SPECIAL PURPOSE FUND REPORTING

Page 106 of 109

 WHEREAS, Cook County engaged McGladrey LLP to perform an audit of the FY2013 basic financial statements;
and
WHEREAS, the FY2013 Cook County audit affirms that expenditures from said funds must be specific to an
allowed purpose, and found a material weakness in the financial accounting and reporting relative to certain special
purpose funds; and
WHEREAS, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be
prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis; and
WHEREAS, the audit found that certain special revenue funds that receive resources that are restricted to a special
purpose do not have sufficiently detailed information in each individual fund’s general ledger detail supporting
expenditures; and
WHEREAS, without such information, there is not a sufficient audit trail to support that all expenditures are
specific to an allowed purpose; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has both a fiduciary and ethical duty to the County
taxpayers to ensure that all financial matters are in accordance with best accounting practices and are fiscally
responsible; and
WHEREAS, detailed reporting of special purpose fund transactions will allow the Board and the public to suitably
scrutinize and ensure such funds are properly administered.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby direct that
a report of all special purpose fund transactions with sufficiently detailed supporting information as to the specifics
of each transaction be made to the Cook County Board of Commissioners by the Director of Budget & Management
Services on a quarterly basis.
