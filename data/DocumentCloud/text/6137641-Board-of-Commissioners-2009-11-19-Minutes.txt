NOW, THEREFORE, at a meeting convened on October 22, 2009 and concluded on November 19,
2009, Be It And It Is Hereby Resolved by the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, Illinois as
follows:
RESOLUTION AND ANNUAL
APPROPRIATION BILL FOR THE
FISCAL YEAR 2010
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY:
Section 1.

That the Board of Commissioners of Cook County (the “County Board”) hereby finds
that all recitals contained in the preambles to this resolution are full, true and correct and
does incorporate them into this resolution by this reference.

Section 2.

That the County Board, hereby establishes and ordains Fiscal Year 2010 as commencing
on December 1, 2009 and concluding on November 30, 2010.

Section 3.

That this Resolution be and the same is hereby termed the “Annual Appropriation Bill” of
the County of Cook for Fiscal Year 2010. The Estimates of Current Assets and the
Revenues of the Fiscal Year 2010 Available for Appropriation, and the amounts
appropriated and the objects and purposes thereof, are as specified in the following:
Executive Budget Recommendations for Fiscal Year 2010, Volumes I and II, as amended
by the County Board through the amendment process; Estimate of Revenue and
Available Resources for Fiscal Year 2010, as amended by the County Board through the

Section 4.

That the amounts herein set forth be and the same are hereby appropriated for Fiscal Year
2010.

Section 5.

That the salaries or rates of compensation of all officers and employees of the County,
when not otherwise provided by law, shall be governed and administered by the
compensation plans in force and effective in the Fiscal Year 2010 Appropriation Bill.
Amounts actually paid may vary due to rounding based upon the payroll automated

by statutes or ordinance. The plan can be found in Tab Section Appendices. Each
County Department shall be responsible for conducting an on-going in-house evaluation
of all budgeted positions to determine whether existing job titles are correct and accurate
with respect to duties performed and whether employees in such titles are placed
51

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 22, 2009
RECESSED AND RECONVENED NOVEMBER 19, 2009
accordingly. The Bureau of Human Resources shall provide guidance and direction with
regards to union and non-union job classifications where necessary. Any and all changes
in classification shall be subject to the approval of the Chief, Bureau of Human

made in accordance with such schedule subject to modification by direction or approval
of said position and classification plan, and no payroll item shall be approved by the
Comptroller of the County (the “Comptroller”) or paid by the County Treasurer of the

proper Officials of The County of Cook to expend all or any portion of the appropriation
herein contained reserved for adjustments in wages of employees, when approved by the
County Board.

Section 7.

That, only employees on the 110 and 126 accounts are eligible for employee benefits not
to exceed amounts commensurate with their appointments when employed in less-than
full-time status (except that employees on other accounts shall be eligible for pension
benefits to the extent provided by statute) and that to provide benefits to persons on leave
from County service without interruption, all such employees shall be carried in zero-pay

temporary replacement during the absence of employees on leave, the 126 account shall
be used for this purpose. However, only employees on 130 and 155 accounts will receive
benefits that have such provisions in their contract or employment agreement. The
Director of Budget & Management Services is hereby authorized to transfer amounts
between the 110, 115, 119, 126, 129, 130, 133, 155 and 169 accounts where necessary to
support salaries for employees carried on these accounts. The Director of Budget &
Management Services is authorized to make necessary transfers to the 110 account from
the 115, 119 and other related accounts to cover salaries and wages consistent with pay
plans approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

accounts to support said payments.

Section 8.

That the Elected Officials, Heads of Departments, offices, institutions or agencies of the
County, are hereby prohibited from incurring any liability against any account in excess
of the amount herein authorized for such account without securing the prior approval by
the Board of Commissioners for the pledging of appropriate unencumbered balances for
subsequent transfer as provided for by the Board of Commissioners.
That the Elected Officials, Heads of Departments, Offices, Institutions or Agencies of the
County are also hereby prohibited from offering employment chargeable to accounts 110,
126, 129, 130, 133 and 155 without obtaining Budget & Management Services’
validation that funds are available.

52

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 22, 2009

authorized for 110 funding in the next fiscal year or the position will be deleted at yearend.

Section 10.

That there are hereby created internal service accounts for purpose of consolidating
payments to a single vendor for goods and services rendered to the various agencies of
county government into which the County Comptroller may from time to time make
transfers from corresponding amounts budgeted to each agency. Payment of claims,
premiums and other associated costs may be made directly from these internal service
accounts. Each month, the County Comptroller shall report to the Finance Committee all
transfers made pursuant to this section.

Section 11.

That an allowance for the indemnity portions of workers’ compensation, including
payments for total temporary disability (TTD) and permanent partial disability (PPD),
shall be charged to each department’s workers’ compensation line item 172 with the
exception that if a claimant is released to return to work light duty, and the department
does not provide a light duty position, the indemnity portion of the charges shall be
charged to the department’s 110 salary account the first full pay period immediately
following notification to the department of availability for light duty. In the event that
the total annual charge for all workers’ compensation claims in line item 172 exceeds its
annual appropriation in line item 172 for any given department, agency, or elected office,
all subsequent workers’ compensation claims for that fiscal year shall be funded by a
corresponding reduction in the total annual operating appropriation for that department,
agency, or elected office.

Section 12.

That, in the event the department of Facilities Management, Telecommunication
Operations, Comptroller’s Office, or Management of Information Systems performs work
on behalf of and at the behest of another County agency, the work performed on straight
time using County employees shall not be charged to the beneficiary agency, but for all
work performed on overtime, the overtime differential may be charged to the beneficiary
agency’s 120 account with the approval of the County Comptroller.

Section 13.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 22, 2009
RECESSED AND RECONVENED NOVEMBER 19, 2009
for Claims, account 826, shall be deposited to the Self Insurance Fund during the first
month of the fiscal year. The Self Insurance Fund shall be credited with all interest
earned from Self Insurance Fund investments during the year. This Fund shall be
charged for comprehensive general liability, and malpractice insurance claims and related
expenses. Effective Fiscal Year 2010, each agency will be responsible for the
appropriation of projected claims. For each Fiscal Year thereafter, the Budget Director
shall determine, based on actuarial analysis and recent claims history, the annual amount
to be appropriated for each department in account 826.
Section 15.

That appropriation authority to procure capital equipment by Special Revenue Funds
using short-term financing arrangements (Accounts 715 and 717) shall require repayment
by the Special Revenue Fund over the period approved by the Chief Financial Officer.
These repayments will be deposited annually to the 715 and 717 accounts to reinstate
overall appropriation authority. The Chief Financial Officer may determine that leasefinancing arrangements are most beneficial. The Director of Budget & Management
Services is hereby authorized to transfer funds from the 715 and 717 accounts to the 714
account where the Chief Financial Officer has determined lease financing is beneficial.

Section 16.

That appropriation for capital improvements are made by Bond Series Number (Bond
Account) which defines the project or major project group. The Chief Financial Officer
is authorized to allocate available appropriations to detail projects within the project,
project group, or Bond Series Number. Upon the final completion of detailed projects
within a Bond Series Number, the Chief Financial Officer shall notify the Director of
Budget and Management Services and request to close the project or reallocate excess
appropriations to other Bond Series Numbers (Bond Accounts). On a monthly quarterly
basis, the Director of Budget & Management Services shall submit to the County Board a

to complete each project; the amount of funds allocated toward each project group or
project from the particular bond fund; the balance of encumbered funds; projected
remaining expenses for the individual capital projects, broken down by the remaining
quarters of the current fiscal year, and future fiscal years for which there are expected
expenses; and the amount of unencumbered funds. For project groups, the report shall
include such information for each component of the group. The Status Report shall also
list any transfers of allocated funds between Bond Series Numbers (Bond Accounts),
project groups and projects over $25,000 and any reallocations made by the Director of
Budget and Management Services at the completion of projects pursuant to this section.

Section 17.

For the purpose of enabling the County to have in its treasury at all times sufficient
money to meet demands thereon for ordinary and necessary expenditures and to provide
temporary working cash advances to the Cook County Forest Preserve District in an
amount not to exceed $1.5 million per year, the total of the County’s Working Cash
Funds shall be maintained in the amount of $219,577,442 projected as of November 30,

as necessary. Notwithstanding any provisions of the Illinois Compiled Statutes requiring
the immediate application of ad valorem property tax receipts for the reimbursement of
the Working Cash Funds, the Working Cash Funds shall be reimbursed from time to time

57

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 22, 2009
RECESSED AND RECONVENED NOVEMBER 19, 2009

not be subject to the requirements of this section.

Section 29.

That notwithstanding any other provision of this Resolution and Annual Appropriation
Bill for Fiscal Year 2010, the maximum amounts available for appropriation to each
budgetary unit or groups of budgetary units shall be set at 98.5% 97% of the Final
Adopted Appropriation; for budgetary units or groups of budgetary units for which the
decrease in budgeted amounts from Fiscal Year 2009 to Fiscal Year 2010 was 5% or
greater, the maximum amounts available for appropriation shall be set at 98.5%. For
each fund in the Annual Appropriation Bill, the difference between the Final Adopted
Appropriation amounts for each budgetary unit or groups of budgetary units in the
Annual Appropriation Bill and the corresponding amounts set forth at 98.5% of Final
Adopted Appropriation for such budgetary unit or groups of budgetary units in this
section is hereby appropriated to an account 814/580380 – Appropriation Adjustment.

new revenues shall be allocated based on the Allocation of Revenue to Appropriations,
58

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 22, 2009
RECESSED AND RECONVENED NOVEMBER 19, 2009
by Fund and Program as shown in the Citizens’ Summary. In like fashion, where such
new revenues fall short of their Revenue Estimate, the Chief Financial Officer, the
Comptroller, and the Director of Budget and Management Services shall report the
shortfall to the Board of Commissioners for an immediate amendatory reduction in
appropriation authority previously granted to the budgetary unit(s), based on the
Allocation of Revenue to Appropriations, by Fund and Program.
Annual revenue projections for all fees administered by Elected Officials shall be
determined by the office of the Elected Official with appropriate jurisdictional authority
over the fee(s). Each office, department, or agency with said authority shall be
responsible for preparation of an annual plan to collect revenues at a sufficient level to
meet projections. In the event that revenue generated from a fee is not sufficient to equal
or exceed the annual projection and a shortfall is projected, as determined by the Director
of Budget and Management Services at the end of each quarter, and when it is further
determined that the shortfall is a result of a failure to impose a fee as required by law, or a
failure to properly administer and collect a fee as required by law, the Director of Budget
and Management Services shall report the shortfall to the Board of Commissioners for an
immediate amendatory reduction in appropriation authority previously granted, based on
the Allocation of Revenue to Appropriations, by Fund and Program.
Notwithstanding this Section, when any elected official (or head of a department, office,
institution, or agency) files a written Notice of Non-Concurrence with the Chief Financial
Officer, the Comptroller, and the Director of Budget and Management Services of the
County, not more than ten (10) days after amendatory action by the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, when such action results in an upward revision of any previously
stated revenue estimate wherein the budgetary unit(s) so stated has management authority
over the revenue generating activities, appropriations shall not be reduced as provided
above.
Section 30.

Any employee who is required and is authorized to use his or her personally owned
automobile in the regular conduct of official County business shall be allowed and
reimbursed under the Cook County Transportation Expense Reimbursement and Travel
Regulations Policy will supersede any other travel policy unless provisions contained in
contracts approved by the County Board of Commissioners between the County and
recognized collective bargaining agents; and provided further that this allowance is
subject to change by the County Board of Commissioners during the fiscal year in
accordance with such contracts.

Section 31.

Where fund revenues exceed appropriations, such excess shall be used to establish a
contingency (“rainy day”) fund, in order to maintain the fiscal stability considered
especially important by credit rating agencies (as recommended by the Government
Finance Officers Association).

Section 32.

Severability - If any section, paragraph or provision of this resolution shall be held to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability of such section,
paragraph or provision shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this resolution.

Section 33.

Repealer - All ordinances, resolutions or orders, or parts thereof, in conflict with the
provision of this resolution are to the extent of such conflict hereby repealed.

Section 34.

Constitutional power of the County - The Resolution is adopted pursuant to the
59

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 22, 2009
RECESSED AND RECONVENED NOVEMBER 19, 2009
constitutional powers of the County as a home rule notwithstanding any provisions of the
Illinois Compiled Statutes to the contrary.
Section 35.

The Director of Budget and Management Services and the Comptroller are authorized to
correct any factual errors in the Annual Appropriation Bill and to implement the adopted
Amendments with any required modifications.

Section 36.

Effective Date - The County Board hereby finds that this Resolution shall be in full force
and effect immediately upon its adoption by the Board and approval by the President of
