At this point in the proceedings, Vice-Chair Palamara provided remarks as follows:
“March is well known for many things, including Women’s History Month, St. Patrick’s
Day and the beginning of spring. Today we’re going to have a brief presentation and
recognize two people who have a nexus to some other things that March is known for –
National Reading Month, and exciting basketball tournaments; aka March Madness and
84

 getting ready for change. Today the Wayne County Commission is recognizing two iconic
newspaper columnists, one from the Detroit Free Press, and the other from The Detroit News.
In some ways, both of these people are victim of their own success; as the newspaper
business has changed drastically and dramatically, from the times when each entered the
profession of newspaper journalism, until now. It’s been reported that both of these people
have accepted early-out incentives from their newspaper, that saved and will saved other’s
jobs, will be phasing into new chapters of their career. In the future, we may not be reading
their award-winning columns in the Detroit dailies as often as we’d like -- and in a perfect
world, maybe not even as often as they would have liked -- but life, much like a journalism
career, isn’t always fair. And it’s high time, that these two storied members of “The Fourth
Estate” be given their due. They have literally taught untold thousands of people how to read
with a keen eye, how to think with an open mind and how to absorb and process. The
passions of their works with an honest heart, these two people embody human decency and
the halcyon days of the newspaper business. Their columns were must reads and the way
they turned a phrase, helped give rise to the term – Water cooler topics.
Today we pause, to reflect upon and honor two people who consistently represented
their flagship institutions, the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News, with class, clarity,
dignity and distinction. We’ll honor them separately and one at a time.”
At this point in the proceedings, Vice-Chair Palamara read and presented each
resolution followed by remarks from the recipients.

results for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2018 and includes the
year-end adjustments to the amended budget and actual results; estimates used
95

 in the fourth quarter projections reflect certain modifications to the original
assumptions used in the adopted budget and are based upon the most recent
financial information available; Schedules I and II relate specifically to the
projected net deficit of $(9.7) million compared to the planned deficit of $(33.3)
million included in the Amended Budget; this represents a positive variance from
budget of $23.5 million; a surplus of $20.9 million is projected from General Fund
operations compared to the amended budget planned deficit of $(2.9) million
representing a positive variance of $23.8 million; presented separately as a
Special Item and discussed below is the transfer of $30.6 million from the
General Fund balance sheet reserves to the 2018A Jail Construction fund for
construction of the new Criminal Justice Center (CJC); General Fund revenues
have a projected surplus of $1.4 million primarily the result of projected increases
in Taxes of $11.4 million, Interest and Rents of $3.5 million and Other Revenues
of $1.4 million; the increase in taxes and other revenues are offset by decreases
in Charges for Services revenues of $(8.5) million, State Grants and Contracts of
$(3.2) million, Local Grants and Contracts of $(1.2) million, and Federal Grants
and Contracts of $(1.9) million and all other revenue sources projected at a
decrease is a net of $(0.14) million; Expenditures are projected under budget by
$23.3 million primarily due to a $14.4 million savings in General Government,
$5.6 million savings in Health and Welfare, $2.3 million savings in NonDepartmental, $1.6 million savings in Judicial and $1.1 million savings in the
Legislative functions; this is offset by a projected deficit in Public Safety of $(2.1)
million and a net surplus of $0.39 million is projected in all other expenditure
categories; Other Financing Sources (Uses) are projected under budget by $(1.0)
million; displayed as a Special Item on the Fourth Quarter Projection in order to
isolate it from general operations, $30.6 million is being projected to be
transferred to the Criminal Justice Center as agreed in the funding agreement
between the County and Rock Ventures; Schedule IV shows projected summary
financial results for the County’s General Fund, special revenue, debt service,
internal service and court funds; this schedule identifies both the revenue and
expenditure projections by fund and the anticipated changes to the fund balance
or net assets; Schedules IV, V, VI and VII contain additional information
formatted by fund, department and major category; this report includes the
