From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

FY 2018 Year-end Audit Progress Report

Background: The fieldwork for the audit of the Great Lakes Water Authority’s FY 2018
financial statements began on October 15, 2018 and is currently winding down. Ken Melvin
from Rehmann Robson, auditors for GLWA, was in attendance at the October 26, 2018
Audit Committee meeting to review the progress report (attached).

Analysis: Mr. Melvin will be in attendance at the November 16, 2018 Audit Committee
meeting to provide a verbal update on the audit process. At the time of the preparation of
this memo, staff and auditors are working on draft financial statements and footnotes. We
are reworking some of the financial statement account groupings and supplemental
schedules in response to inquiries received during the 2018 bond sale from key
stakeholders. While this is causing a delay of approximately three to six calendar days, it is
presently anticipated that the audit report will be issued on or about December 13, 2018.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

 AGENDA ITEM #6B

Date: November 16, 2018

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Deirdre Henry, Treasury Manager
Re:

Investment Strategy and Related Proposed Contract Extension with PFM Asset Management
LLC (GLWA Contract No. GLWA CS-022)

Background: In November 2015, Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) engaged PFM Asset
Management LLC (PFM) as a registered investment advisor to assist with 1) identifying portfolio
and cash management optimization opportunities, 2) overcome personnel resource constraints
during the stand-up of both GLWA and DWSD-Retail, 3) expand the transparency and capacity of
investment portfolio reporting, and 4) provide an added level of controls.

PFM has worked with the GLWA treasury staff to 1) negotiate and increase bank earnings credit
rates, 2) invest debt service and debt reserve funds, 3) transition balances in bank deposit accounts
to higher yielding government money market and local government investment pools, 4) invest
funds in construction and trust accounts into longer term investment securities, 5) develop
quarterly investment report package and 6) identify a portfolio strategy appropriate for GLWA.
With PFM’s assistance, GLWA earned $4.3 million in investment income for fiscal year 2017 and
$13.2 million in fiscal year 2018. The projected investment earnings for fiscal year 2019 is $19
million.
The original PFM contract amount in 2015, which did not contemplate PFM actively managing the
portfolio, was $250,000. As we have worked through the optimization of the portfolio, identifying
cash management opportunities, development of the reporting package, and PFM’s management of
the portfolio, the contract has been extended and increased two times. The current contract total
amount is $700,000 and is scheduled to expire December 2018.
Analysis: The use of a registered investment advisor has proven to be a cost effective and efficient
approach to portfolio management. The investment advisor allows GLWA to have direct access to
financial market expertise while allowing the treasury team to focus on the development of cash
flows, treasury internal controls, and process improvements.

We have now reached a steady state in identifying GLWA cash flows and fund balances. Based on
the analysis and review of our portfolio we have identified an investment strategy for GLWA. This
strategy segregates the funds into cash flow portfolios and benchmarked portfolios. The cash flow
portfolios will be managed using the Earnings Target Approach which focuses on income stability
and specific cash flow predictability. The benchmarked portfolios are proposed to be managed
using a Total Return Approach with PFM having approval to actively manage the portfolio to

Page 6

 maximize investment returns while considering financial market conditions and GLWA goals of
liquidity and safety. It should be noted that this change in strategy that achieves a desired outcome
of increased investment earnings while preserving compliance with GLWA’s investment policy and
Michigan Public Act 20, Investments of Surplus Funds of Political Subdivisions.

GLWA Treasury recommends an investment strategy which includes active management of some of
the funds. Given the timing for implementation of this investment strategy, it is recommended that
the PFM contract be extended for a year to allow for stability of this investment approach. The
contract extension would be through December 2019 and increase the contract amount by
$370,000. The total life-to-date PFM contract amount after this increase would be $1,070,000 which
requires approval action by the GLWA Board.
The fees charged by PFM are reasonable. As a measure of reasonableness, the total contract
amount of $1,070,000 is 2.9% of the total portfolio income for FY 2017, FY 2019 and FY 2019. In
addition, the estimated annual fee of $415,000 is .04% of the September 2018 investment portfolio
balance of $981,577,211.

Active versus Cash Flow (Passive) Management
 There are basically two ways to manage an investment portfolio: active or passive

 Active Management implies that the portfolio manager may sell some investment securities in order

to shift assets to other instruments
• This many be done simply to rebalance a portfolio that has become over-concentrated in one
sector, or it may reflect an effort to enhance total returns by trading or swapping into securities that
are expected to outperform the original holding
 Passive Management is an investment strategy in which securities are bought with the intention of

holding them to maturity or investing in benchmark products designed to yield a market rate of return
• Cash flow structured portfolios are considered passive portfolios as securities are purchased with
the primary purpose of providing liquidity on a specific future date
 GLWA is currently following a passive strategy

Page 12

 Active Management vs. Cash Flow Focused Strategies
Active Management
 Ideal for funds with expansive permitted investments
and / or uncertain liquidity needs
• Advisor goal: generate incremental earnings via
swapping amongst individual CUSIPs, sectors, and
duration buckets to attempt to offset advisory fees
• Enhanced ability to take advantage of benefit from
near-constant duration exposure
Cash Flow Strategies
 Ideal for funds with defined cash flow needs and
defined permitted investments
• Securities are purchased with intent to hold to
maturity and typically used to fund a specific need
(i.e., debt service funds)
• May require significant change to market conditions
and / or cash flow requirements for restructurings to
add value

• Expected to contribute no more than 20% to

• With low rates, income cushion is minimal

• Collective portfolio strategy produces targets
• Manage within a duration band for each product
• Generally cautious investment approach helps us in

Issuer / Security
Selection

• Expected to contribute 20% - 25% to the
return of the portfolio
• Liquidity differs by issuer and by sector
• New issue concessions can add value
• Universe limited to high-grade credits

• Investing in liquid issues provides opportunity for
active management
• Will also invest where there is a liquidity premium
when appropriate
• Limit non-government issuer exposure to 2%
• Changes in relative investment values give insights
into credit strength
• Follow dynamic credit process with maturity limits
for each credit -- credit is first

Yield Curve

• Expected to contribute 15% - 20% to the
return of the portfolio
• Shape of curve may provide roll-down
• Yield per unit of risk varies over time and by
security sector

• Macro outlook over 3 – 6 months drives forward
rates view
• Seek greatest income per unit of risk
• Assess expected investment returns over 3 – 24

Investment Objectives – Yield vs. Total Return
 Yield is the income return at a point in time, expressed as an annualized rate of return based on cost, and is forwardlooking; the calculation of yield assumes no changes in cash flow and reinvestment rates (GLWA is currently using an
earnings target approach)
 Total return is calculated based on interest and both realized and unrealized changes in market value, expressed as
a rate of return over a specified period of time based on cost, and is backward-looking (the use of a total return
approach is a GFOA best practice)

 Impact on Portfolios

 

What Would be Different with Active Management
 Current investment procedures: “Buy and Hold” for cash flow related portfolios

• Once a security is purchased, it is held to maturity with no active management
 “Active Management”: PFM would actively manage benchmarked portfolios with full discretion (subject to GLWA’s

investment policy)
•

Formal benchmark(s) would be established and portfolios would be managed with similar characteristics
–

•

Securities may be sold prior to maturity to improve the overall earning potential of the portfolios
–

•

© PFM

Performance and characteristics would be evaluated relative to the benchmark (GFOA best practice)

GLWA would continue to receive trade tickets for all transactions

PFM would not confirm reinvestment or maturity ranges
–

GLWA would inform us of any unexpected cash flows (inflows or outflows) in these accounts

–

To assist in orderly trades, unexpectedly large and significant cash flows should be communicated with
as much advanced notice as possible

AGENDA ITEM #6C

Date: November 16, 2018

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

FY 2030 Financial Forecast

Background: Earlier this calendar year, the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) initiated
an FY 2030 financial forecast. This desired outcome of this effort is a roadmap for
financially sound and sustainable utility that meets is capital and operational needs in an
environmentally responsible manner.
Analysis: The Foster Group LLC has developed a model to assist GLWA in this planning
effort. Attached is a report and related analysis (the latter is designed for 8.5 x 14
printing).

Mr. Foster will be in attendance at the Audit Committee to provide a live demonstration of
the model as we discussion a range of possible assumptions (such as capital spending,
budget levels, paygo capital, debt management, charge adjustments, and others) and the
related outcomes.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

MEMORANDUM
Executive Summary Financial Forecast Model
To:

November 12, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
At your request, we have developed an “executive summary” version of our financial forecast
model. This tool is designed to easily illustrate potential impacts of alternative assumptions
and policies on key financial metrics. While it is not as robust as the modeling tools we utilize
when preparing financial feasibility and related forecast analyses, we believe it can provide
valuable information to stakeholders in a simplified manner.
The foundational assumptions and projections for this forecast model are consistent with our
financial feasibility report(s) developed in support of the recent bond sales, which contained
financial forecasts for a five year period ending with FY 2023. We have extended the forecast
period to FY 2030 in order to provide a longer term vision, consistent with the analyses we’ve
been discussing over the past year.
The first page of the model illustrates forecasted revenues and revenue requirements under
three key assumptions:
1. Annual increases in Charges;
2. Annual increases in O&M Budget;
3. Average annual CIP Financing requirements.
Based on decisions regarding these assumptions, the model computes the adequacy of existing
fund balances and revenue transfers to finance capital improvement requirements, and
calculates amounts of additional debt necessary to fully fund the CIP. The debt service
requirements are computed and impact the financial metrics accordingly. The version of the
model reflected in the attached exhibits is “pre loaded” with assumptions consistent with the
recent feasibility reports, and with our understanding of the latest long term CIP plans –
although annualized and “funded at” 80% of planning levels. This equates to approximate
annual amounts of $140 million for Water and $120 million for Sewer.
The second page of the model presents forecasted results for key metrics, designed to be
reflected in a “red/yellow/green” format aligned with relative rating agency assessments. As

Page 41

 Executive Summary Financial Forecast Model

November 12, 2018
Page 2

we have discussed in prior conversations on this topic, these metrics are not necessarily
definitive, but do provide guidance on how the investment community views the credit
worthiness of GLWA and its peers.
We note that the metrics and criteria illustrated on page 2 should be considered a work in
progress, and we encourage review by GLWA’s financial advisor and other stakeholders.
Having said that, we believe the presentation on page 2 for each system is fairly self evident,
and we’ll not elaborate herein. Rather, we stand prepared to present this model to the Audit
Committee on November 16, and to illustrate hypothetical results of alternative assumptions
and policy considerations.

Capital Improvement Plan Relative to Financial Plan (Continued)

Background: At its meeting on October 26, 2018, the Audit Committee was asked to
consider a Capital Spend Rate assumption policy. Attached is a copy of the materials
presented related to that discussion. Also attached is a revised, proposed policy for the
Audit Committee’s consideration.

Analysis: The proposed policy attached, reflects feedback received. Staff recommends
adoption of the policy.
Proposed Action: The Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water Authority
Board of Directors adopt the Capital Program Spend Rate Assumption policy with an
immediate effective date for implementation with the FY 2020 through FY 2024 five-year
planning cycle.

Page 47

 Great Lakes Water Authority
PROPOSED Capital Program Spend Rate Assumption Policy

Purpose: The Spend Rate Assumption (SRA) policy provides an analytical approach to
bridge the total dollar amount of projects in the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) with what
is realistically available to spend for budgetary purposes and/or delayed for non-budgetary
reasons. Those limitations, whether financial or non-financial, necessitate the SRA for
budgetary purposes, despite the prioritization established in the CIP. The outcome is a
reasoned balance between a desired level of capital investment with financial strategies to
manage debt levels and control adjustments to customer charges.
Policy: Annually, a projected spend rate assumption for the financial plan related to the
proposed capital improvement plan will be established based upon pertinent factors and
data available at that time. Such pertinent factors and data will include the mix of projects
and phases in the proposed CIP, interdependency risk, criticality, and other measures
provided by the GLWA team members that develop and manage the CIP projects. That
spend rate assumption will be presented to the Audit Committee no later than December
31st each year after the GLWA Board, Capital Improvement Planning Committee, and
member partners have had the opportunity to review the draft capital improvement plan.
Adopted: By the Great Lakes Water Authority Board on ________________________________.

Re: Capital Improvement Plan Relative to Financial Plan

Background: The annual update to the Great Lakes Water Authority?s five-year capital

Magnitude and complexity of CIP as a regional water authority

To better understand this topic, we drew upon two sources of input: 1) engineering
team members and 2) The Foster Group who has prepared and monitored the financing plan,
debt issuance, and capital plan for GLWA and its predecessor regional operations for many
years.

Engineering Team Member Feedback

1. Obtaining buy-in and acceptance of project alternatives within a study or
preliminary design phase of a project.
Example: the final route for the Water Works Park to Northeast water transmission
main ($130 million) is on hold pending acceptance from the City of Detroit. GLWA
has identified a route that carries the least disruption to residents, however the
route has not yet been endorsed. Result is that GLWA is on hold for the design ofthe
pipeline.

2. Obtaining maintenance agreements, permanent easements and property
acquisitions. These are common for new pipeline projects and require in-depth
conversations and workshops with numerous property and utility owners. We build
time into our planned schedules for these activities; however, there are times when
circumstances are out of our control and delays occur.

Example: Achieving agreement with a county parks department for a new water
transmission main which is designed to be placed in county park property.

3. Opportunities driven by other regional stakeholders which alter priorities,
timelines, and spending. To optimize regional infrastructure investments, 
goal is to engage in opportunity projects with other regional stakeholders such as
Michigan Department of Transportation, county road commissions, DTE, ITC, 
cities, and townships.

4. Rebids and revisions. There are times when projects have to be re-bid due to
proposal irregularities. This causes a delay in a project?s start. If it is engineering
services, then the associated construction contract is delayed which impacts
projected spend rates.

P568656 2

 

Prior month report

 

Vendor performance. There are times that vendors do not meet project deadlines
even though GLWA issues a notice, writes notices to cure, and in the case of
construction contracts assesses liquidated damages.

 

Operational needs. Designs include specified work limitations and periods and
durations when the construction contractor will be able to take certain systems out
of service to facilitate construction. These limitations are planned in collaboration
with operations management during the design process. However, operational
circumstances are dynamic and change which sometimes prevents system
shutdowns that are required to execute and complete construction.

7. Post-start changes. Approval of construction change directives and change orders
can consume weeks and sometimes months of time when negotiating change
amounts with the contractors and internal GLWA stakeholders. This may delay a
vendor?s progress of work and related CIP spend.

The Foster Group Report (see attached)

Recommendation: Given the above, it is not reasonable to expect that 100% of the five-
year capital improvement plan will turn into spent dollars. Nor is it appropriate to compile
a financing plan (including the issuance of bonds) that re?ects 100% spend rate. For this
reason, a simple financial policy statement is proposed.

Capital Program Spend Rate Assumption: Annually, a projected spend
rate assumption for the financial plan related to the upcoming capital
improvement plan will be established based upon pertinent factors and data
available at that time. Such factors and data will include the mix of projects
and phases in the proposed CIP, interdependency risk, and other measures
provided by the GLWA team members that develop and manage the CIP
projects. That spend rate assumption will be presented to the Audit
Committee no later than December each year after the GLWA Board and
member partners have had the opportunity to review the draft capital
improvement plan.

Proposed Action: Approve the Capital Program Spend Rate Assumption as proposed or
amended.

Review of Draft CIPs October 24, 2018

To: Nicolette Bateson
From: Bart Foster

You have asked for observations regarding our review of the Authority?s Draft FY 2020
Capital Improvement Programs (CIPs). Speci?cally, you have asked for a review of how the
projected expenditures in the Draft CIPs align with the expenditures that were included in the
?nancing plans established for the recently executed revenue bond transactions.
Those ?nancing plans are set forth in the of?cial statement disclosures for the transactions.
Herewith some commentary based on our initial review.

First, some background regarding the CIP ?nancing requirements that were utilized for the
bond sales. As we prepared the ?nancing plans, we were aware that the actually achieved
capital expenditure levels in recent years were materially lower than published planning levels.
This fact is not a new occurrence, nor is it atypical of large municipal utility systems.
According to my records, the average expenditure achievement? ratio for the predecessor
DWSD in its ?nal 29 full years of existence was approximately 70%. (See attached exhibit
page I). The performance level shows some peaks and valleys, but overall the trend is
consistent. The achievement of the Sewer CIP is a bit higher than that for Water (75% vs.
These ratios are not inconsistent with my experience with other large municipal utility
systems.

These general results have continued for the ?rst two years of existence. According
to the most recently published Construction Work-in-Progress Report the actual expenditure
levels during FY 2017 and FY 2018 were 37% and 36%, respectively. Once again, the Sewer
performance was higher than the Water performance in each of those years. It was with
this recognition in mind that the FY 2018 GLWA Budget anticipated a ??nancing level? of
80% of the published CIPs.

As the FY 2019 Budget was being prepared, it was apparent that the early years of the CIPs

included reduced projected expenditure levels. The ?nancing plan for the FY 2019 Budget
assumed full achievement of the published CIP.

ere are negative consequences of ?nancing capital expenditures that do not end up being
achieved, particularly for municipal utilities that rely heavily on issuance of tax-exempt debt
to ?nance capital improvements. The ability to realize investment earnings on Bond
Construction Funds is restricted, and the earnings rate is always lower than the borrowing rate.
In recent years the difference between these two interest rates has been signi?cant.
Maintaining larger than needed balances in these Funds is a net income losing strategy. There
are also potential tax law compliance issues when borrowed monies are not spent within the
originally anticipated schedule. Negative consequences also emerge in this scenario when
project expenditures are revenue ?nanced, as rates and charges must be set at levels
that produce unspent reserve balances. These instances often result in customer and
stakeholder concerns.

As we prepared the ?nancing plans for the recent bond transactions, we recognized the
prudence of establishing a realistic expectation of capital expenditures to ?nance, and modi?ed
the CIP ?nancing requirements accordingly. In summary, our approach for the capital
?nancing plans for the bond sales included:

0 No changes to the FY 2019 projected expenditures;

0 A ??nancing level? of 80% of the total expenditures between FY 2020 and FY 2023;

A phased ramp up of FY 2020 through FY 2023 expenditures, particularly for the Water
CIP.

This approach is illustrated on the ?rst 7 lines of each section of the attached exhibit page 2,
and resulted in the CIP ?nancing expenditure plan ?gures on Line 6 for Water and Line 16 for
Sewer. In the bond of?cial statements, we acknowledged that the CIP expenditure schedule
for purposes of the bond ?nancing plan was different from the formally approved, published
CIP. See below from the of?cial statements.

?The Fiscal Year 2019 Water and Wastewater Capital Improvement Plan was approved
by the GL WA Board on June 20, 2018. The CIP is dynamic and requires continual review and
modification during the course of each year. GL WA has initiated e?orts to prepare the Fiscal
Year 2020-2024 CIP, and the CIP expenditure schedule shown in the following table re?ects the
initial planning levels established as part of those update e??orts. 

As noted in the disclosure language, we expected that the FY 2020 CIP would re?ect the
moderated level of projected expenditures.

We have reviewed the Draft FY 2020 CIP and compared the ?nancing requirements to those

included in the bond ?nancing plans. See the last three lines in each section of exhibit page 2.
General observations:

0 The Draft FY 2020 CIP (Water and Sewer combined) is $275 million higher than the
target established for the bond ?nancing plan.

Page 55

 

Prior month report

 

eview of Draft CIPs October 24, 2018
Page 3

 

In order to align the Draft CIP with the bond ?nancing plan, signi?cant planned project
deferrals into years 6 through 10 would be required to move this $275 million outside
the short-term ?nancing window - or . . .

A "capital ?nancing level? assumption on the order of 75% to 80% would be
appropriate for policy consideration.

0 The Draft FY 20 CIP assumes rapid project delivery performance. The plan indicates
Water expenditures will quadruple and Sewer expenditures will double compared to
what was realized during FY 2018.

Exhibit page 3 provides a graphical comparison of the ?gures shown on exhibit page 2.

We recognize that the Authority?s infrastructure plans include projects that are essential to
maintaining and improving quality of service and achieving strategic objectives. This
discussion is not intended to question the intent of the overall plans or individual projects.
However, we do think it would be prudent to consider policy approaches that result in capital
?nancing plans that re?ect the challenges of implementing such plans, as evidenced by recent
experience. We trust that this discussion provides thoughtful topics for policy consideration
and we are available to present these observations and discuss this matter at your convenience.

Reconciliation Committee Update

Background: The Reconciliation Committee is defined by the Water and Sewer Services
Agreement (WSSA) between the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) and the Detroit
Water & Sewerage department (DWSD) as a DWSD Board Member and GLWA Board
Member along with GLWA’s Chief Executive Officer, DWSD’s Director, and their respective
Chief Financial Officers and General Counsels.

The 2018 Memorandum of Understanding, finalized in June 2018, between GLWA and
DWSD requires the parties to meet at a minimum quarterly (January, April, July, and
October). The purpose of the quarterly meetings is to expand the level of communication
between the two entities related to financial, operational, legal, capital planning, and other
matters and opportunities for improved management and coordination of both entities and
foster a positive partnership in the water services sector. The results of those meetings
shall be reported back to the respective Boards by the Board liaison.
In the event that there is a budget shortfall, the WSSA require that the Reconciliation
Committee meet promptly for the purpose of reviewing actions the City proposes to take to
address such significant unfavorable variance. Following the meeting of the Reconciliation
Committee, the City agrees to take actions to address any such significant unfavorable
variance and to make appropriate adjustments to the related Detroit Local System Budget
in the current and succeeding Fiscal Year.

Analysis: The Reconciliation Committee held its first meeting on October 19, 2018. A
primary topic at that meeting was a net budgetary shortfall in the local sewer fund of $56.27
million through June 30, 2018 (unaudited) of which $29.52 million was outstanding as of
June 30, 2017. The action items from that meeting were for the DWSD representatives to
discuss the matter with their Board, which they did on November 7, 2018. The next step for

Page 58

 DWSD is to provide written notice as it relates to the plan to address the shortfall. DWSD
has a number of remedies available as descrobed below.

The 2018 MOU provides that if DWSD experiences a cumulative negative variance of more
than two percent (2%) of the total budget for either Local System (a “Budget Shortfall”) from
its budget adopted pursuant to the Water and Sewer Services Agreement based on DWSD’s
quarterly reports to GLWA, DWSD, as the agent of GLWA, shall, within thirty (30) days
thereafter, schedule a meeting of the Reconciliation Committee to discuss the magnitude and
reasons for the shortfall and possible approaches to address the shortfall. Within sixty (60)
days after the Reconciliation Committee meets, DWSD, as agent, shall develop a plan to cure
the Budget Shortfall and the time period within which the shortfall will be cured, taking into
account the reasons for and magnitude of the shortfall. If Revenues, including, but not limited
to, adjustments to Local O&M expenditures and the use of subsequent positive receipts, are
not available to cure the Budget Shortfall within the same Fiscal Year, DWSD shall reallocate
available funds in the related DWSD I&E Account or reallocate any unencumbered Lease
Payment to eligible debt service to satisfy the Budget Shortfall.

Budget Shortfalls not cured by the end of the Fiscal Year following the year in which they
arise shall be repaid in full, in installments, over a period not to exceed the next three fiscal
years, plus a surcharge calculated as provided below, as part of the Revenue Requirement
payable by DWSD. The surcharge factor on the portion of the Budget Shortfall which remains
unpaid at June 30 of the Fiscal Year following the fiscal year in which the Budget Shortfall
arises shall be based on the three-year U.S. Treasury Note Rate, as published in the Wall
Street Journal, plus 150 basis points.
Until the Budget Shortfall is repaid, and unless DWSD has other resources available for that
purpose or otherwise agreed to by GLWA, DWSD shall apply any available funds in the
related DWSD I&E Account for that purpose. GLWA Board approval shall be required for
repayment terms in excess of three (3) years. The quarterly Reconciliation Committee
meetings shall include a review of the progress in eliminating the Budget Shortfall.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Oakland-Macomb Interceptor Drainage District Update

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority’ (GLWA) has been engaged with
representatives of the Oakland-Macomb Interceptor Drainage District (OMIDD) in relation
to a potential operating arrangement for certain facilities leased by GLWA from the City of
Detroit. Those discussions include assets referenced in the attached correspondence from
earlier in this calendar year.
Analysis: The discussion with OMIDD representatives continues to be underway. This
has been an opportunity for both parties to exchange information and ideas related to
financial and operational matters. There are no definitive next steps at the time of
preparing this memo. A verbal update will be provided at the Audit Committee meeting.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Detroit, MI 48226

Re: Response to Foster Group Memorandum, April 19, 2018
Cost of Service FY 2018-19

Dear Chairperson Baker:

On April 20, 2018, appearing before the GLWA Audit Committee, the Oakland-Macomb
Interceptor Drain Drainage District provided commentary on the Foster Group
response dated April 19, 2018 (?Foster Group Memorandum?) to previously raised questions and
concerns on the proposed FY 2018?19 Cost of Service charges to the OMID. The Audit
Committee requested that the OMID prepare its response to the Foster Group Memorandum.
Below are our comments and concerns regarding the FY 2019 Sewer Charges to the OMID:

1. Foster Group Memorandum:

?Capital Revenue Requirement Allocations

Since the establishment of the FY 2011 Sewage Disposal Charges, GLWA allocations of
capital revenue requirements (including debt service) have been allocated to cost pools
and Customers based on a ?Utility Basis? approach. Under this approach statistics from
the ?xed asset records of the Sewer Utility are used to allocate capital costs. For instance,
if 1% of the representative capital asset value for the Sewer System is related to OMID
speci?c assets, then 1% of the capital revenue requirements (including debt service) are
allocated to 

OMID Response:

In 2009, the City of Detroit (?City?) transferred to the OMID certain sanitary sewer
interceptors, pump stations, meters and appurtenant facilities originally constructed and owned
by the City. As part of this transaction, the City also entered in a ?Settlement and
Release of Certain Rate Disputes? agreement dated October 22, 2009 (?Release Agreement?).
According to the Release Agreement, the only debt service that was to be assigned to the OMID
was the debt service associated with capital improvements at the Northeast Pump Station
The pertinent portion of the Release Agreement is restated below:

Page 61

2.

Summary of Post?Closing Debt

a. The parties agree that after the Oakland?Macomb Interceptors have been
transferred to the District and the Macomb Interceptors to Macomb County, the
only debt service included in the sewer rates for the District, other that debt
service allocated "common-to?all? or ?suburban common?to?all," will be debt
service associated with capital improvements at the Northeast pump station
(excluding meters at the Northeast Pump Station). Further, no debt service in the
rates for the C-OSDS or the in and associated with the
meters listed in Section l(d) will be included in the District's rates as a suburban
common?to?all charge in the FY 2009/2010 rate year or subsequent rate years.?

Regardless of whether GLWA (as the successor entity to the City) utilizes Cash Basis,
Utility Basis or any other basis, any debt service assigned to specific? other than for the
Northeast Pump Station would be inconsistent with the Release Agreement.
Accordingly, in addition to the NEPS, the City (and now GLWA) should not have assigned any
debt service for the North Interceptor East Arm since 2009.

Foster Group Memorandum:

?Operating Revenue Requirement Allocations

For purposes of assigning operating costs to the OMID cost pool, the same
approach (relative inch miles) is used to assign related interceptor costs. In
the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study this resulted in approximately $0.43 million of
direct operating revenue requirements allocated to the OMID cost pool.

 

With regard to the NEPS operating costs, GLWA allocations of all budget
operating expenses related to sewer pumping stations (including maintenance,
SCADA, etc.) have been assigned to individual sewer pumping stations based on
relative electric usage or costs. This approach was established several years ago,
as detailed speci?c pumping station maintenance costs, etc. were dif?cult to
isolate. For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we obtained budgeted
electric utility costs for several years. The relative budgeted electric utility costs
for the NEPS, as a proportion of budgeted electric utility costs for all GLWA
sewer pumping stations, ranged from 24% to 40%. in our FY 2019 Cost of
Service Study we allocated 25% of all sewer pumping station operating expenses
to the NEPS, which resulted in direct operating costs totaling $5.88 million being
assigned to the OMID cost pool. So our FY 2019 Cost of Service Study included
$6.05 million of direct operating revenue requirements assigned to the OMID cost
pool, which was then directly assigned to the OMID Customer.

The combined total revenue requirement allocated to the OMID cost pool in the
FY 2019 Cost of Service Study was $10.50 million.?

OMID Response:

Page 2 of 4

Page 62

 

As indicated above, the NEPS is assigned costs based on electrical usage which was
established several years ago by the City, and continued under GLWA. However, the OMB)
Wastewater Disposal Services Contract dated October 22, 2009 (?Service Contract?), indicates
that such allocations requires justi?cation, as well customer OMID) consent (which ?shall
not be unreasonably withheld?). To assist us in understanding costs allocations, we
request GLWA provide justi?cation that establishes a reasonable relationship between electrical
usage and the allocations of other costs associated with the operations of the NEPS.

In addition, although we understand that the transition from DWSD to GLWA is still a
workuin-progress, the Service Contract provides that separate accounts should have been
established for the NEPS to account for all costs associated with this facility. To our knowledge,
this process was never implemented by the City prior to, or by GLWA, after the transfer of the
regional system. It would be helpful to understand whether GLWA intends to establish separate
accounts to which all costs will be charged by employees for in?house labor, parts, equipment
and contractual services, or whether GLWA intends to continue to allocate these costs. If the
latter, we will need justification as to why it is more cost effective to allocate these costs rather
than directly account and bill for them. For purposes of this letter, we have restated the relevant
portions of the Service Contract below concerning this particular issue:

?22.02 Northeast Pump Station Costs and Accounting. Customer shall be
responsible for the payment of all costs arising out of or related to the operation,
maintenance, improvement and repair the Northeast Pump Station. City will
establish separate accounts for the Northeast Pump Station to which all costs will
be charged by employees for in?house labor, parts and equipment and for
contractual services. In the event the City determine that it is more cost effective
to allocate certain labor functions or establish a flat charge rather than
directly account for them, it may do so with Customer's prior consent which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld so long as City has provided a
acceptable cost allocation justification for the proposed allocation or flat charge.
An allocation or flat charge will be subject to periodic review and adjustment at
intervals no greater than five years. City will maintain supporting records for all
Northeast Pump Station charges for 12 months after the Look Back for the
relevant financial year has been completed and the associated detailed rate
notebook has been made available to Customer. Supporting records will be
available for Customer review upon written request. City will invoice Customer
directly for the cost of operating, maintaining improving and repairing the
Northeast Pump Station on a quarterly basis. These cost will not be recovered
through the rates.?

During the April 20 Audit Committee meeting, we also indicated that there are two
customers which receive customer specific charges associated with sewage pump stations: the
City and the At that time, we inquired as to how the City was assessed by GLWA for its
customer specific sewage pumping stations, and were informed that Shared Services Agreement
establishes the charges for the operations and maintenance of the City?s sewage pump station.

Page 3 of 4

Page 63

We have reviewed the Shared Services Agreement between the City and GLWA, and in
particular, Schedule which identi?es the charges for GLWA services. Attached is a
copy of Schedule Under the Shared Services Agreement Schedule 
GLWA provides 24/7 operations, maintenance, engineering and management services for the
following City facilities: (1) Belle Isle Main Pump Station and Combined Sewer Over?ow
Facility; (2) Bluehill Pump Station; (3) Fischer Pump Station; and (4) Woodmere Pump Station.
According to Schedule (for FY 2016 Budget), the City?s share of the total annual
estimated cost to operate and maintain these facilities, is $1,393,598 (see attachment for specific
services provided). Moreover, the City is directly responsible for all utilities. Any emergency or
extraordinary repairs are separately billed with supporting documentation. Using this
information, it appears that the OMID is being charged signi?cantly more for a similar level of
service for operations and maintenance associated with NEPS than the City is for its pump
stations. GLWA needs to justify this disparate treatment for similar levels of service. Further,
based on the Shared Services Agreement, GLWA is currently capable of directly billing for
services provided.

Remaining Foster Group Memo Item:

During the April 20 Audit Committee meeting, the Committee did not address the
treatment of return on rate base and depreciation expense. We are willing to discuss this matter
as well as the responses above, at the convenience of the Audit Committee.

On behalf of the Oakland-Macomb Interceptor Drain, thank you for taking the time to
review our responses to the issues raised in the Foster Group Memorandum. If you have any
questions regarding this matter please feel free to contact me.

Si ?ely,

MEMORANDUM
FY 2019 Sewer Charges to OMID
To:

April 19, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
You have asked for commentary and observations regarding a potential response to public
comments made by representatives of the Oakland Macomb Interceptor Drain District
(OMID) at the GLWA Audit Committee meeting on February 23. We have reviewed the
comments, which appear to request modifications to proposed FY 2019 Sewer Charges to
reflect four specific areas of inquiry. Herein we present background information, set forth
our understanding of OMID’s request, and provide a summary of our analyses and
perspective regarding the request.
Background:
The GLWA cost allocation methodology1 for purposes of establishing Sewer service charges
includes a “customer specific” cost pool designed to capture the costs related to GLWA
facilities that serve only the OMID. These facilities include the Northeast Sewer Pumping
Station (“NEPS”), and the portion of the North Interceptor East Arm (“NIEA”) downstream
of the NEPS that conveys flow only from OMID. The cost of service allocation methodology
has traditionally employed slightly different approaches for assigning capital and operating
revenue requirements to this cost pool.
Capital Revenue Requirement Allocations
Since the establishment of the FY 2011 Sewage Disposal Charges, GLWA allocations of
capital revenue requirements (including debt service) have been allocated to cost pools and
Customers based on a “Utility Basis” approach. Under this approach statistics from the fixed
asset records of the Sewer Utility are used to allocate capital costs. For instance, if 1% of the
representative capital asset value for the Sewer System is related to OMID specific assets,
then 1% of the capital revenue requirements (including debt service) are allocated to OMID.
GLWA’s review of the interceptor inventory indicates that the NIEA segment in question
represents approximately 3.5% of all GLWA interceptors, based on an “inch mile” analysis.
For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we assigned 3.5% of all interceptor
capital revenue requirements to the OMID cost pool. This created a direct capital revenue
requirement of approximately $0.78 million.
1

The GLWA methodology is consistent with the methodology of the predecessor entity, DWSD.

Page 74

April 19, 2018
Page 2

Our cost of service study included a review of the GLWA asset records, which indicated that
the net book value of $19.6 million assigned to the NEPS. This NEPS asset value (and the
representative annual depreciation expense) amounted to approximately 1.2% of the overall
capital asset structure, and we used this ratio to subsequently allocate approximately $2.81
million of direct capital revenue requirements. So our FY 2019 Cost of Service Study
included $3.59 million of direct capital revenue requirements assigned to the OMID cost
pool, which was then directly assigned to the OMID Customer2.
Operating Revenue Requirement Allocations
For purposes of assigning operating costs to the OMID cost pool, the same approach (relative
inch miles) is used to assign NIEA related interceptor costs. In the FY 2019 Cost of Service
Study this resulted in approximately $0.43 million of direct operating revenue requirements
allocated to the OMID cost pool.
With regard to the NEPS operating costs, GLWA allocations of all budget operating
expenses related to sewer pumping stations (including maintenance, SCADA, etc.) have been
assigned to individual sewer pumping stations based on relative electric usage or costs. This
approach was established several years ago, as detailed specific pumping station maintenance
costs, etc. were difficult to isolate. For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we
obtained budgeted electric utility costs for several years. The relative budgeted electric
utility costs for the NEPS, as a proportion of budgeted electric utility costs for all GLWA
sewer pumping stations, ranged from 24% to 40%. In our FY 2019 Cost of Service Study we
allocated 25% of all sewer pumping station operating expenses to the NEPS, which resulted
in direct operating costs totaling $5.88 million being assigned to the OMID cost pool. So our
FY 2019 Cost of Service Study included $6.05 million of direct operating revenue
requirements assigned to the OMID cost pool, which was then directly assigned to the OMID
Customer3.
The combined total revenue requirement allocated to the OMID cost pool in the FY 2019
Cost of Service Study was $10.50 million.
Pending Potential Operating Agreement
We have participated in several meetings between GLWA and OMID representatives as they
have sought to establish an “operating agreement regarding the OMID specific facilities
addressed in this memorandum. Elements of that potential operating agreement would impact
the cost allocation approaches and results discussed above.
2

Table 3 in the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study Report contains a “Net Capital” Revenue Requirement line item
that includes proportional allocation of certain other “indirect” non-operating items, such as the Lease Payment,
etc. These indirect elements result in the OMID “Net Capital” Revenue Requirement totaling $3.99 million in
the Cost of Service Study Report.
3
Table 3 in the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study Report contains a “Net Operating Expenses” Revenue
Requirement line item that includes proportional allocation of certain other “indirect” operating items, such as
the operating portion of the pension obligation, etc. These indirect elements result in the OMID “Net Operating
Expenses” Revenue Requirement totaling $6.52 million in the Cost of Service Study Report.

OMID Request, Analyses, and Perspective:
1. Reflect the treatment of debt service for the OMID only rate category consistent with the
October 22, 2009 Settlement and Release of Certain Rate Disputes as stated in
paragraph 3.a of that document.
• We believe that the reference in the OMID correspondence is taking a position that
the district should not be allocated any capital revenue requirements associated with
the portion of the NIEA that conveys only OMID flow. We do not agree with that
conclusion. We believe that the agreement that is cited in the referenced document
predates the agreements established as part of the Rate Simplification Initiative. In
any event, we encourage this issue to be further explored and discussed as part of the
negotiations towards the Operating Agreement. For purposes of our hypothetical
analysis summarized in the table that follows, we have reflected the calculated effect
of removing such capital revenue requirements from the OMID cost pool, which
would reduce the direct OMID cost pool allocated revenue requirements by
approximately $0.78 million. However the OMID share of the reallocated commonto-all (“CTA”) revenue requirement would increase by $0.13 million, resulting in a
net decrease of $0.65 million.
2. Adjust the assets of the Northeast Pump Station based on the results of the Northeast
Pump Station asset inventory review performed on February 2, 2018 with representatives
from OMID and GLWA.
• As noted in the request, subsequent to the establishment of the proposed FY 2019
charges, additional review of the capital asset data reported for the NEPS has been
conducted. It is our understanding that the parties are in basic agreement that the
asset records should be adjusted to reflect the results of that review, and that the
adjustments will result in a $5.2 million reduction in the 6/30/17 net book value
allocated to the NEPS – which would result in a revised total of approximately $14.4
million. For purposes of our hypothetical analysis summarized herein, we have
reflected the calculated effect of adjusting the capital revenue requirement allocations
accordingly. Based on our analysis, this would reduce the direct OMID cost pool
allocated revenue requirements by approximately $0.82 million. However the OMID
share of the reallocated common-to-all (“CTA”) revenue requirement would increase
by $0.12 million, resulting in a net decrease of $0.70 million.
3. Adjust the OMID only cost category revenue requirements to reflect any changes which
may occur pending the review of electrical costs.

As noted in the request, subsequent to the establishment of the proposed FY 2019
charges, additional review of the sewer pumping station electric use and costs has
been conducted. While the analysis continues4, the initial findings indicate that the
NEPS accounts for approximately 36% of recent pumping station electric bills, and
approximately 44% of recent total pumping station electric usage. Had we the benefit
of this additional analysis at the time we conducted the FY 2019 Cost of Service
Study, we likely would have allocated at a minimum 35% (rather than the 25%
original figure) of total sewer pumping station operating revenue requirements to the
NEPS. This hypothetical adjustment would have resulted in a $2.74 million increase
to the operating revenue requirements allocated to the OMID cost pool. However the
OMID share of the reallocated common-to-all (“CTA”) revenue requirement would
decrease by $0.45 million, resulting in a net increase of $2.49 million.
As shown in the table, the net impact of incorporating all of the hypothetical
adjustments noted above would result in a net increase of approximately $0.94
million. Given that the parties are negotiating an Operating Agreement, and that
GLWA is exploring a “Charges Stability Adjustment” to reflect potential adjustments
of actual costs, we do not believe it is prudent to modify the originally proposed FY
2019 Sewer Charges.

4. At the January 31, 2018 GLWA/OMID meeting, GLWA stated depreciation expenses for
the 2018-19 sewer rates will be utilized at 60% of the book value. For the formation of
GLWA, Duff and Phelps analyzed the GLWA assets, stated their values for the beginning
4

The additional review includes an analysis of the amount of wastewater volume handled by each sewer
pumping station. The initial estimate indicates that the NEPS handles approximately one-third of all flows that
utilize GLWA sewer pumping stations.

balances, and revised the remaining lives of the assets. Why use 60% instead of the full
amount of the depreciation expenses, does GLWA dispute the accuracy of their book
values? Further, if GLWA goes forward with the 60% for 2018-19 sewer rates, is there a
plan to move towards utilizing the full amounts of depreciation expense in the future?
• As noted in the request, the GLWA capital assets were subjected to a valuation
analysis conducted by Duff and Phelps, which was required to complete the creation
of GLWA. The leased regional assets were booked at an acquisition value based on
the Duff and Phelps analysis, which resulted in an increase in the net book value of
the “acquired” assets. However it also resulted in a significant increase in the annual
depreciation expense. In our opinion, GLWA does not dispute the accuracy of the
book values not the depreciation expense, but also recognizes (as do we) that the
changes produced by the asset valuation changed the dynamic of the overall asset
structure. For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we sought to strike a
balance between the portion of the capital revenue requirements that were allocated
(under the Utility Basis approach) based on net book value, and the portion that were
allocated based on annual deprecation expense. The approach we applied
successfully accomplished this balance, and adhered to the overarching stability
objectives of the GLWA charge methodology initiatives. We recommend that future
cost of service studies continue to embrace these objectives with respect to this
specific issue.
We trust that this discussion is responsive to the request, and we are prepared to discuss this
matter at your convenience.

 AGENDA ITEM #7A

Date: November 16, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jonathan Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Inaugural Ratings for Junior Lien Debt

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority’ (GLWA) has made efforts to maximize its
use of the state of Michigan’s state revolving fund (SRF) program as a lower cost
alternative to finance its water and sewer capital programs. Since GLWA’s (and formerly
the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department) level of participation in the SRF program has
grown to over twenty percent (20%) of the entire SRF loan pool portfolio, GLWA was asked
by the state of Michigan Finance Authority to obtain a rating on GLWA’s outstanding water
and sewer junior lien bonds that were issued through the SRF program.
Analysis: GLWA received a rating on November 13, 2018 from S&P Global Ratings (S&P).
A rating of 'A' has been assigned to GLWA’s outstanding sewage disposal system junior-lien
state revolving fund (SRF) bonds and an 'A+' rating has been assigned to GLWA’s
outstanding water supply system junior-lien SRF bonds. Both ratings are consistent with
the second lien ratings assigned by S&P on September 5, 2018. A copy of the ratings report
is attached.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Rationale
S&P Global Ratings has assigned its 'A' rating to the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA), Mich.'s outstanding sewage
disposal system junior-lien state revolving fund (SRF) bonds and its 'A+' rating to the authority's outstanding water
supply system junior-lien SRF bonds. We have also affirmed our:
• 'A+' rating on GLWA's outstanding sewage disposal senior-lien bonds,
• 'A' rating the authority's outstanding sewage disposal second-lien bonds,

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

NOVEMBER 13, 2018 3

Page 82

 Summary: Great Lakes Water Authority, Michigan; Water/Sewer

• 'AA-' rating on GLWA's outstanding water supply system senior-lien bonds, and
• 'A+' rating the authority's outstanding water supply system second-lien bonds.
The outlook on the sewage disposal system bonds is positive and the outlook on the water supply system bonds is
stable. Related to its sewage disposal system, currently GLWA has $523 million of SRF junior-lien bonds, $752 million
of second-lien bonds, and $1.9 billion of senior-lien bonds outstanding. Related to its water supply system, currently,
GLWA has $34 million of SRF junior-lien bonds, $668 million of second-lien bonds, and $1.6 billion of senior-lien
bonds outstanding. Our ratings incorporate our opinion of GLWA's creditworthiness to make payments on all of its
outstanding obligations.
The ratings reflect the application of our wholesale utility criteria, but we do not follow a purely weak-link approach
since GLWA has, in our view, additional financial strengths that could be used to support debt payments if a single
participant does not fulfil its payment obligations. These strengths include pledged reserves and unrestricted liquidity
available at the wholesaler GLWA level, the ability to adjust revenue requirements to participants as its cost structure
changes, and strong management policies related to both the regional system and Detroit's local system. The fact that
GLWA's service base is large and serves a large percentage of the state's population also supports our view that the
ratings should reflect that diversity, with overall economic considerations playing a more prominent role in the credit
analysis.
In September 2018, we raised the ratings to the above-mentioned levels based on several factors:
• Oversight through an agency relationship and cooperation with the Detroit Water and Sewer Department (DWSD)
and its Board of Water Commissioners that we view as strong and supportive of credit quality. Because of Detroit's
extremely weak overall economic indicators and historical collections and bad debt issues, we view both the
existence and continuation of these functions as key to the maintenance of the rating at its current level.
• Overall management and governance functions that we also view as supportive of credit quality at the current rating
level. GLWA management maintains active communication with both the DWSD retail system and its wholesale
customers and has a comprehensive set of internal policies related to, among other things, maintenance of certain
financial targets, key performance indicators for both financial and operational metrics, and internal controls.
• Actual financial performance has continued to exceed projections from prior feasibility studies. Now that GLWA has
two full fiscal years (2017 and 2018) of operating as a separate entity from DWSD, and that various reconciliations
and adjustments related to the separation have already taken place, we would expect that future variances to the
feasibility studies may not be as dramatic. However, given GLWA's comprehensive budgeting practices and strong
budgetary oversight of DWSD's operations, we would expect that future financial performance should be largely
consistent with the most current projections.
• GLWA is not under any regulatory-driven capital costs from consent orders or consent decrees. While we view the
GLWA system as highly leveraged, the fact that all of the capital plan is forward-looking and not mostly being used
to cure regulatory infractions is a key credit strength that is supportive of the current rating level.
• Limited future exposure to pension cost escalation from legacy Detroit obligations resulting from prior bankruptcy
negotiations. It is our understanding that after the 2023 fiscal year, both GLWA and DWSD pension costs related to
legacy pension plans will drop from a total for both water and sewer systems of $45.4 million (which is a mandated
contribution based on Detroit's bankruptcy plan of adjustment) to what is currently projected to be no more than

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

NOVEMBER 13, 2018 4

Page 83

 Summary: Great Lakes Water Authority, Michigan; Water/Sewer

$9.1 million. These additional payments would be used to retire the remaining unfunded liability from the
closed/legacy pension plans that has arisen after the original payments were determined in 2014.
Additional factors supporting the rating include the following:
• A diverse revenue stream from a large number of wholesale customers; and
• Revenues from both wholesale customers and the DWSD retail system that are either entirely (sewage disposal) or
primarily (water) fixed, which, in our view, significantly insulates GLWA's financial performance from volatility
caused by weather and flow variances.
Offsetting these strengths for the sewage disposal system rating are the following factors:
• Ongoing negative revenue variances from the DWSD local sewer system that have, in our view, material effects on
the overall creditworthiness of the GLWA sewage disposal system. GLWA reports that the negative revenue
variance caused by DWSD for the 2018 fiscal year is about $19.8 million. The authority has also experienced
significant negative and positive outflows in the DWSD system since 2016 due to various one-time events, although
GLWA reports that the 2018 variance most likely reflected DWSD's implementation of a new drainage charge
program and related litigation.
• We note that continued developments related to this drainage charge program litigation will help to inform our view
on the rating depending on how it is resolved.
Offsetting the strengths for the ratings on both systems is Detroit's economy, which we consider very weak. In our
view, this could continue to place downward pressure on utility collection rates in the city. Another factor is high
system leverage that we do not believe will abate significantly at least over the two-year outlook horizon.
Additional details regarding the rating can be found in our report, published Sept. 5, 2018, on RatingsDirect.

Outlook
The positive outlook on the sewer system bonds reflects our expectation that there is at least a one-in-three chance
that the rating could improve over the two-year outlook horizon. The most significant factor we are expecting to lead
to an upgrade is resolution of what we view to be significant revenue variances caused by the DWSD local system. It is
our understanding that progress is being made to resolve these variances, but there could be ongoing revenue
pressures depending on how the drainage program litigation is resolved.
The stable outlook on the water supply system bonds reflects our opinion that the rating should not change, at least
over the two-year outlook horizon, due to several factors, including the following:
• Our expectation that the water supply system's financial metrics should remain at levels generally consistent with
current projections due to the rate structure that provides a large amount of revenue stability;
• DWSD revenue variances should remain low, given both GLWA's and DWSD's continued efforts to improve
collections; and
• Exposure to a large service base that extends beyond the boundaries of the immediate Detroit area, which should

WWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT

NOVEMBER 13, 2018 5

Page 84

 Summary: Great Lakes Water Authority, Michigan; Water/Sewer

help continue to support stable usage trends.

Upside scenario
For an upgrade of the sewer system bonds to occur over the next two years, we would also expect the following to
occur:
• Continued financial performance that meets or exceeds GLWA's expectations as reflected in the current feasibility
study;
• No large and unforeseen capital needs that would cause either large and sustained reductions in liquidity or
significant increases in fixed costs; and
• Continued demonstration that the relationship with DWSD through the service agreement and memorandum of
understanding is being successfully used to minimize any future financial disruptions that may occur.
While possible, we currently do not expect to raise the rating on the water supply system bonds in the foreseeable
future, absent both financial performance well above what current projections indicate and economic indicators for
Detroit that show significant improvement. We believe that both current and projected financial performance and
service base characteristics are consistent with the current rating level.

Downside scenario
While the outlook on the sewer system debt is currently positive, we could revise it to stable without raising the rating
if we believe that a resolution with DWSD related to its ongoing revenue variances is not settled in a fashion that is
either sustainable long term or able to achieve a significant amount of variance reduction. If economic stress or cost
escalations lead to financial results measurably worse than that GLWA currently projects, then either the outlook,
rating, or both could be negatively affected.
As for the water supply system debt, if economic stress or cost escalations lead to financial results measurably worse
than that GLWA currently projects, then either the outlook, rating, or both could be negatively affected.

 Investment Performance Report – September 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Executive Summary

PORTFOLIO RECAP
 Safety – The aggregate portfolio is diversified amongst cash, bank deposits, U.S. Treasuries, Federal Agencies, commercial paper, SEC-registered
money market funds, and a local government investment pool. The overall credit profile of the pool is strong with over 98% of the assets invested in
bank deposits or securities that are rated within the two highest short and long-term rating classifications as established by Standard & Poor’s.
 Liquidity – The Authority has reduced its weighting to overnight funds from June, with only 34% of the total assets maturing overnight.
 Return – The overall yield increased to 2.30% as of September 30, 2018 versus 1.84% at June 30, 2018. The Authority earned $4,753,458 in
investment income for fiscal year-to-date on a book value basis. Based on the current interest rate environment, the investment income earned for
the previous quarter, and assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are projecting
that the Authority will earn approximately $19.0 million in investment income for fiscal year 2019.
 Compliance – The aggregate portfolio is in compliance with the Authority’s investment policy and Michigan Public Act 20.

funds and earnings in the Flint Security Deposit account are held on behalf of the City of Flint and do not belong to GLWA. Note that market values move inversely to interest rates, and the recent
rise in yields has led to the overall market value being less than the book value. In addition to the totals listed above, there also exists surety bonds in the amount of $322,809,258 as of 9/30/2018.

 Investment Performance Report – September 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Investment Strategy

GLWA INVESTMENT STRATEGY
 The portfolio is in compliance with the Authority’s investment policy
 To date, the Authority has continued to invest its funds in a mixture of short and intermediate-term investments to ensure
sufficient liquidity
 The aggregate portfolio was yielding 2.30% at the end of September*
– This compares to the 2.12% yield of the Bank of America / Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as of
9/30/2018, which is a comparable market indicator
 The Authority continues to implement a disciplined investment plan to provide improved safety and diversification and putting
every dollar to work
 For the second quarter of FY 2019, the Authority has taken initial steps to gain support for full discretionary / active
management on specific portfolios in which GLWA’s investment advisor would actively manage benchmarked portfolios with full
discretion (subject to the Authority’s investment policy)
 The Authority will continue to work with its investment manager to further refine its cash flows and continue to identify strategies
to maximize future investment income while meeting the objectives of safety and liquidity
 Assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for FY 2019 and the interest rate environment remains in a
similar range, we conservatively expect to earn approximately $19.0 million in interest income in FY 2019

* Current market yield as of September 30, 2018.

 Investment Performance Report – September 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS UPDATE
 U.S. growth remained healthy in the third quarter of calendar year 2018 as the unemployment rate hit historical lows,
confidence rose further, and stocks surged; this occurred despite ongoing concerns about a trade war with China, a
disorderly Brexit, Italian budget concerns, Iran sanctions, a Turkish debt crisis, and other geopolitical risks.
 Amid strong economic fundamentals, the Federal Reserve stayed the course, raising the Federal Funds rate by
0.25% to a new target range of 2.00% – 2.25%; despite the removal of longstanding language from the Federal Open
Market Committee (“FOMC”) statement that previously characterized the stance of monetary policy as
“accommodative,” updated FOMC forecasts indicated an additional 0.25% hike is expected in December, followed by
two to four more hikes in 2019.
ECONOMIC IMPACT ON PORTFOLIO
 U.S. Treasury yields rose by 20 – 30 basis points (0.20% to 0.30%) in the quarter, with short-term yields outpacing
longer-term yields, and this resulted in a flatter yield curve over the quarter, though the pace of flattening moderated
near quarter-end.
 The yield curve remains very flat from a historical perspective (less incentive for investors to increase maturity), and
because the yield curve is so flat, holding shorter maturities resulted in very little yield concession for the Authority’s
various portfolios.
 Commercial paper yield spreads grinded to one-year lows over the quarter, and as a result, short-term credit instruments
now look more expensive relative to U.S. Treasuries; however, they still offer incrementally higher yields relative to
similar-maturity government alternatives, particularly for the Authority’s debt accounts.
 While diversification away from Treasury securities has added significant value to the Authority’s portfolios over the last
several quarters, very narrow spreads across most investment-grade sectors give us reason to turn a bit more cautious.

Portfolio Mix
Cash / Money Market vs. Investments
 The Authority's liquidity requirements fluctuate each month based on operational requirements, capital funding, and debt payments. Based on a
review of historical activity and refinement of cash flow projections, the Authority has set an average target of 45% cash/money market accounts
and 55% investments for the portfolio holdings.
 The chart below compares the monthly allocation of the portfolio holdings to the 13-month average and the target. The decrease in the cash/money
market holdings for August and September of 2018 is related to the investment of intermediate and longer-term funds based on refined cash flows.

The accounts at Comerica Bank get an earnings credit to offset bank fees. The earnings in the accounts at First Independence Bank is credited to the contractors and not the Authority. The funds in
the Flint Security Deposit account are held on behalf of the City of Flint and the earnings do not belong to GLWA. YTM @ Cost is the expected return, based on the original cost, the annual interest
receipts, maturity value and the time period from purchase date to maturity, stated as a percentage, on an annualized basis. YTM @ Market is the rate of return, based on the current market value,
the annual interest receipts, maturity value and time period remaining until maturity, stated as a percentage, on an annualized basis.

 Investment Performance Report – September 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Demonstration of Yield to Maturity vs. Duration
As of September 30, 2018
 The comparison agencies included in the list below were selected based on type and/or other non-performance based criteria to show a broad
range of water entities/utilities. This peer group list does not represent an endorsement of any of the public agencies or their services. The types of
funds (e.g., bond proceeds, debt service, etc.) and duration of the overall portfolios listed below as well as the various differences in permitted
investments and allowable credit capacity in state statutes (i.e., the ability or non-ability to invest in long-term corporate credit) will have a direct
impact on the corresponding yields at market.
 The overall yield of the Authority’s aggregate portfolio compares favorably to those of other short-term indices (i.e., the S&P LGIP index and the 3month U.S. Treasury index).
 The Authority does not have a potential for a longer duration portfolio when compared to other similar water entities/utilities as the Authority’s
covenants limits and restricts its ability in managing assets to a longer-term strategy.

 Investment Performance Report – September 2018
Great Lakes Water Authority
Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS
 Economic conditions were characterized by:
– Stronger growth in the U.S., propelled by tax cuts and fiscal stimulus
– A robust labor market, with the U.S. unemployment rate near 48 year lows
– Core inflation near the Fed’s 2.0% target, while oil prices have surged and wages have begun to trend higher
– Consumer confidence at a near two-decade high, while measures of manufacturing activity are also very strong
– A resurging stock market, with the S&P 500 index rising by 7.7% for the third quarter, the largest quarterly gain since
the fourth quarter of 2013
– The Federal Reserve increasing short-term rates 0.25% per quarter, and signaling the expectation they will continue
to do so through 2019
– But additionally, an escalating trade war with China, weakness in emerging market economies and currencies, and
also political uncertainty
 U.S. Treasury yields rose 20 – 30 basis points (0.20% – 0.30%) over the quarter as the yield curve flattened further:
– Short-term Treasury bill yields rose by 25 – 30 basis points
– The yield on the 2-year Treasury Note rose by 29 basis points to end the quarter at 2.82%
– The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose by 20 basis points to end the quarter at 3.06%
– Short-term rates reflected Fed rate hike expectations, while longer-term yields were the result of moderate inflation
expectations, persistently low global interest rates, and a negative “term premium”
 After a weaker second quarter, strong economic fundamentals gave investors confidence in corporate and other nongovernment sectors; most investment-grade sectors contributed positive excess returns (returns in excess of similar-duration
Treasuries) to fixed-income portfolios for the quarter

Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS
 The incremental yield offered in many sectors relative to U.S. Treasuries has narrowed to a point that analysis indicates the
current income cushion may struggle to offset the potential adverse impact of future spread widening
– As has been the case for some time, Federal Agency yield spreads remained extremely narrow throughout the
previous quarter
– After providing several consecutive quarters of incremental income relative to short-term government alternatives,
yield spreads on commercial paper grinded to 12-month tights
 While the Fed’s policy actions will depend on future economic data, most market participants believe the current strength of
the U.S. economy, coupled with a strong labor market and rising inflation, will cause the Fed to continue raising rates at a
pace of about 0.25% hike per quarter well into 2019
 The outlook for some of the major investment-grade fixed-income sectors are as follows:
– Federal Agency securities remain expensive, as most maturities offer less than five basis points of incremental yield
relative to U.S. Treasuries
– Short-term money market investors continue to reap the rewards of current monetary policy tightening; in addition,
increased projections for U.S. Treasury debt issuance over the next several quarters may continue to pressure shortterm yields higher in both the government and short-term credit spaces

Greetings!
This month, the Great Lakes Water Authority Financial Services Area presents the inaugural
Monthly Financial Report Binder. This is the result of significant effort by GLWA to build a solid
financial team; identify, implement, and continually improve our financial processes; and work with
our partners in Information Technology to build reliable and increasingly advanced systems to
support all GLWA team members who have a key role in executing sound financial and budgetary
practices.
Highlights of this month’s report include:





Positive FY 2019 financial performance results to date;
Identification of areas of potential risk so that we can mitigate those risks;
Explanation of how GLWA financial elements fit together; and
Identification of progress in financial operations.

This report binder, along with Chief Executive Officer Sue F. McCormick’s monthly CEO Report and
Key Performance Indicator report provide a full menu of operational and financial reports
available online at www.glwater.org .
We thrive on feedback! Please send any comments or suggestions to CFO@glwater.org.
Thank you,

 Budget to Actual Analysis
for the Month Ended August 31, 2018

Budget to Actual Analysis
The Budget to Actual Analysis report includes the following three tables.
1. Revenue Requirement Budget Basis Analysis
2. Operations Budget – Major Operations & Maintenance Budget Category
3. Operations & Maintenance Budget – Major Budget Categories
Revenue Requirement Budget Basis Analysis
GLWA’s annual revenue requirement aligns with a) the basis for calculating customer
charges and b) the Master Bond Ordinance flow of funds. The budget basis is not the same
as the full accrual basis used for financial reporting although the revenues and operations
and maintenance expense are largely on an accrual basis. The primary deviation between
the revenue requirement basis to financial reporting basis is the treatment of debt service,
legacy pension obligations, and lease related activities. The Revenue Requirement Basis is
foundational to GLWA’s daily operations, financial plan, and of most interest to key
stakeholders.
Table 1A - Water Revenue Requirement Budget and Table 1B - Water Revenue Requirement
Budget presents a year-over-year budget to actual performance report. For both systems
there were no budget amendments that change the totals. Therefore, only an “amended”
budget column is represented. The revenue requirement budget is accounted for in the
operations and maintenance fund for each system. Since this report is for August 2018, the
pro-rata benchmark is 16.7% (2 of 12 months for the fiscal year).
Items of key interest discussed below are highlighted in gold on the Tables 1 and 2.
1. For both systems, FY 2019 revenues are at or above target and are consistent with
the prior year (FY 2018) at the same time.
2. Operations and maintenance expense is within the pro-rata benchmark for FY 2019.
Expenses are higher than the current year. While a detail review of activity to date
revealed some increase in spending within approved amounts, the more likely
reason is that GLWA implanted a monthly close cycle during calendar year 2018.
The result is that August 2017 O&M expenses were not accrual basis where August
2018 is accrual basis.
3. The Master Bond Ordinance Commitments are generally funded on a 1/12 th basis
each month. The debt service amount shown on the table is accounted for on that
same basis. In September 2018, the GLWA had a successful bond sale which will
provide a positive budget variance. That amendment will be reported in a future
month.
4. Overall total expenses are in line with the benchmark.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

Operations & Maintenance Budget – Major Budget Categories
The year-over-year benchmark ratio as of August 31 is 16.7% (two months). When
comparing FY 2018 to FY 2017 in Table 2, it would appear that the spending has
increased. This is true in some instances for special projects (such as sludge removal and
disposal for the water operations group). The greater impact, however, is that the
Financial Reporting & Accounting Team has implemented a full accrual basis for interim
financial statements during FY 2018. This anomaly will decrease as we proceed through
FY 2019.

Alignment of Operations & Maintenance Budget Priorities
Analysis

- Expense Variance

The purpose of Table 3 is to evaluate whether the actual spend rate within a category is
alignment with the budget. Given the effort to develop an accurate budget, a variance is a
red flag of a potential budget amendment or misalignment of priorities.
Notable items are highlighted in golf in Table 3.
Electricity as a budgeted category is 13.5% of the total, while it represents 20.4% of the
year-to-date spend. In this scenario, it is an item that staff is reconciling with year-end
accruals. This is a budgetary exception that was pending negotiation with DTE and review
with the Board which occurred after August 31, 2018.
Conversely, contractual services is 34.1% of the budget but only 29.3% of the spend-to-date.
This is good news as it represents a positive budget variance. However, staff is reviewing
activity in that category to identify if there are areas for concern, such as a delayed initiative.

1. Statement of Net Position - All Funds Combined
2. Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position – All Funds Combined
3. Supplemental Schedule of Operations & Maintenance Expenses -All Funds Combined
4. Supplemental Schedule of Nonoperating Expenses – All Funds Combined
On a daily basis, the GLWA utilizes four funds. At the macro level for financial reporting
purposes, the Great Lakes Water Authority has two primary funds: Water Fund and Sewage
Disposal Fund. These funds represent the combined total of four sub-funds for each system
that are used to properly account for sources and uses of funds. Those sub-funds for each
system are: Operations & Maintenance Fund, Improvement & Extension Fund, Construction
Bond Fund, and Capital Asset Fund.
Statement of Net Position – All Funds Combined (Unaudited)

Footnotes to Statement of Net Position
a. Cash and Investments include restricted amounts.
b. Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds is shown at the gross level for sub-fund
activity.
c. Other Assets primarily consists of the contractual obligation receivable from DWSD
related to reimbursement of bonded indebtedness for to local system improvements.
d. Cash Held FBO Advance (for benefit of) DWSD and Cash Held FBO DWSD represents the
net difference between DWSD retail cash received from customers net financial
commitments as outlined in the Master Bond Ordinance.
e. Deferred Inflow and Deferred Outflow relate to financing activity and GLWA’s share of
the legacy General Retirement System (GRS) pension obligation.
f. Liabilities - Short-term include accounts payable, retainage payable, and certain
accrued liabilities. Some items, such as compensated absences and worker’s
compensation, are reviewed periodically but are only adjusted on an interim basis if
there is a material change.
g. Other Liabilities account for the cash receipts set aside for the Budget Stabilization
Fund and the Water Residential Assistance Program.
h. Liabilities – Long-term include bonds payable, lease payable, and legacy GRS pension
liabilities.
i. Net Position (Deficit) is defined by the accounting standards as the residual of all other
elements presented in a statement of financial position. It is the difference between
(a) assets and deferred outflows of resources and (b) liabilities and deferred inflows
of resources. A net deficit occurs when the liabilities and deferred inflows exceed
assets and deferred outflows. GLWA’s net deficit is largely driven by an increase in
depreciation expense as a result of the increase in the acquisition valuation approach
for recording capital asset values in the opening Statement of Net Position on January
1, 2016. Efforts are underway to evaluate the net operating effect of this matter over
the long term.
Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position – All Funds Combined

* Note: Services are provided to the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department (DWSD) via a Water
and Sewer Services Agreement (WSSA). See the “Retail Revenues, Receivables, and Collections
Report” section of this monthly report.
Wholesale Water Billing Basis: Beginning with FY 2016, wholesale water charges were
restructured to create a more stable revenue stream by using a historical rolling average to
project customer volumes which accounts for 40% of the monthly charges and 60% of the annual
customer revenue requirement as a monthly fixed charge.
Table 1 - Wholesale Water Billings shows the FY 2019 water billed usage and
revenues. As of August 31, 2018, the billed usage was at 104.47% of budget and
billed revenue at 102.53% of budget. Billings and usage from the City of Flint are
included as they were assumed in the FY 2019 Budget.
Wholesale Water Collections: The collections represent payments made by wholesale
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for administration
of the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.
Chart 1 - Wholesale Water Collections shows collections by month for the past 12
months compared to billings for the same calendar months to depict net cashflow
from water charges for that time period. Variability in collections in the current
year are associated with timing of the billing cycle. Bills for December, February
and August were posted later than usual due to holiday conflicts and higher
volumes of meter reads requiring review (due to meter issues and water main
breaks). While at times unavoidable, the GLWA billing team is identifying steps to
prevent delays wherever possible.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

** Note: Services are provided to the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department via a Water and
Sewer Services Agreement (WSSA). See the “Retail Revenues, Receivables, and Collections
Report” section of the monthly report.
Wholesale Sewer Billing Basis: Beginning in FY 2015, the “sewer rate simplification” initiative
was applied which provides for a stable revenue stream and predictability for our member
partners. Wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee based upon the annual
revenue requirement.
Table 2 - Wholesale Sewer Billings shows the FY 2019 sewer billed revenue.
Consistent with expectations as a result of sewer rate simplification, billed
revenue is at 100.00% of budget through August 31, 2018.
Wholesale Sewer Collections: The collections represent payments made by wholesale
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for administration
of the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.
Chart 2 - Wholesale Sewer Collections shows collections by month for the past 12 months
compared to billings for the same calendar months to depict net cashflow from wholesale
sewer charges for that time period.
The shift in wholesale sewer collection patterns is largely attributable to the timing of
payments received from one customer. Starting in February 2018, Wayne County’s
(Rouge Valley, NE Wayne and Wayne County #3) payments were received just after the
first of the calendar month for one invoice (showing no collection for the previous month)
and the subsequent invoice was paid in the same calendar month. This pattern has
continued through August 31, 2018. At no time during this period has Wayne County been
over 45 days delinquent in its sewer payments to GLWA. Given the payment amount of
$6.8 million, this produces a “spiking” effect on the chart.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

GLWA Audit Committee November 16, 2018

 Trust Receipts & Disbursements
for the Month Ended August 31, 2018

The Monthly Trust Receipts & Disbursements Report includes the following.
1. GLWA Trust Receipts & Disbursements – Net Cash Flows and Receipts
2. DWSD Trust Receipts & Disbursements – Net Cash Flows and Receipts
3. Combined System Trust Receipts & Disbursements – Net Cash Flows

GLWA Trust Receipts & Disbursements
Net Cash Flows and Receipts Basis: The trusts established pursuant to the Master Bond
Ordinance (MBO) outline a flow of funds that governs the priority of the application of cash
receipts from both the regional wholesale (i.e. Great Lakes Water Authority or GLWA) and local
retail (i.e. Detroit Water & Sewerage Department) activities which are further separated by the
water system and the sewage disposal system.
This report provides an ongoing status of the net cash flow of both organizations (GLWA and
DWSD) to fund their allocated share of Master Bond Ordinance requirements in accordance with
the leases for the regional systems. This report begins with the operational effective date of the
GLWA on January 1, 2016.
Table 1 – GLWA Net Cash Flows from Trust Receipts & Disbursements provides a
summary of cash receipt collections and required MBO transfers by fiscal year as
well as a total of all activity for GLWA since inception at January 1, 2016. Fiscal
year 2019 reflects only two months of activity to date.
Through August 31, 2018 the water fund cash receipts exceeded MBO
disbursements by 118% with a ratio of 111% since January 1, 2016. Through
August 31, 2018, the sewer fund cash receipts exceeded MBO disbursements by
105% and by a ratio of 103% since January 1, 2016.
Chart 1 – GLWA 12-Month Net Receipts – Water outlines monthly cash receipt
trends across two points of reference for the regional water system—current year
and prior year. The black line at the zero highlights the minimum goal for net
receipts.
Chart 2 – GLWA 12-Month Net Receipts – Sewer outlines monthly cash receipt
trends across two points of reference for the regional sewer system—current year
and prior year. The black line at the zero highlights the minimum goal for net
receipts.

DWSD Trust Receipts & Disbursements
Net Cash Flows and Receipts Basis: The trusts established pursuant to the Master Bond
Ordinance (MBO) outline a flow of funds that governs the priority of the application of cash
receipts from both the regional wholesale (i.e. Great Lakes Water Authority or GLWA) and local
retail (i.e. Detroit Water & Sewerage Department) activities which are further separated by the
water system and the sewage disposal system.
This report provides an ongoing status of the net cash flow of both organizations (GLWA and
DWSD) to fund their allocated share of Master Bond Ordinance requirements in accordance with
the leases for the regional systems. This report begins with the operational effective date of the
GLWA on January 1, 2016.
Table 2 – DWSD Net Cash Flows from Trust Receipts & Disbursements provides a
summary of cash receipt collections and required MBO transfers by fiscal year as
well as a total of all activity for DWSD since inception at January 1, 2016. Fiscal
year 2019 reflects only two months of activity to date.
Through August 31, 2018 the local water fund cash receipts fell slightly short of
MBO disbursements at 99% with a historical ratio of cash receipts exceeding MBO
disbursements at 103% since January 1, 2016.
Through August 31, 2018, the local sewer fund cash receipts fell short of MBO
disbursements at 92% with a slightly improved, historic shortfall of 95% since
January 1, 2016. The Reconciliation Committee is discussing this shortfall and a
remediation plan as part of its quarterly meetings.
Chart 3 – DWSD 12-Month Net Receipts – Water outlines monthly activity trends
across two points of reference for the local water system—current year and prior
year. The black line at the zero highlights the breakeven goal for net receipts.
Chart 4 – DWSD 12-Month Net Receipts – Sewer outlines monthly activity trends
across two points of reference for the local sewer system—current year and prior
year. The black line at the zero highlights the breakeven goal for net receipts.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.
