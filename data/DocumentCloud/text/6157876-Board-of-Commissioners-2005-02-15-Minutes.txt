Transmitting a Communication, dated February 14, 2005 from
CARL R. HANSEN, County Commissioner
Please place the submitted item on the Agenda for the meeting of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners for its next meeting of February 15, 2005 with the recommendation that it be referred to
the Committee on Finance.
Submitted is an added starter for the February 15, 2005 meeting of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners. It is recommended that this new item be referred to the Committee on Finance. It
recommends consideration of the following issues as alternatives to balance the FY2005 budget without
increasing taxes:
•

•
•
•

An upward revlSlon of fee revenue estimates in the FY2005 budget of approximately
$23,000,000.00 which is close to the minimum difference between Actual and Estimated Fee
Revenues in 2001.
Reductions in the recommended appropriation for Constitutional Officers for a savings of
$14,658,038.00.
The deletion of the under funded Full Time Equivalent position (FTEs) in the FY2005 budget for
a savings of $25,961,064.00.
A two percent (2%) reduction in the recommended appropriation for all the offices under the
President for a savings of $23,569,408.00.

The latter two items are not mutually exclusive since the under funded FTEs account for part of the
appropriation for offices under the President.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the communication be referred

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Wednesday, February 9, 2005 at the hour of 1:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.

be taken out of order to dispose of them first.
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to consider Communication

269367

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director
transmitting a Communication, dated January 7, 2005: Transmitted herewith for your
approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for the
Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County Water Supply System Upgrade Project - Meter Vault
Upgrade. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

The scope of work to upgrade the 50 year old water supply system is
substantially complete. These changes were necessary to bring the current system
into compliance with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. The final
task of bringing the Halsted Pump Station back on line requires re-energizing our
system with water purchased from the City of Chicago. As a condition of
receiving water for our work at the Pump station, the City of Chicago has
requested the replacement of the existing water meter and the underground vault
in which it is housed.

This project expansion meets the required contractual obligations of Oak Forest Hospital of
Cook County purchasing of water from the City of Chicago.
Bond Issue (33000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 02/01/05.

787

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2005

Commissioner Silvestri asked if any research was done regarding buying water from a closer municipality
rather than buying the water from the City of Chicago, or would similar costs be incurred no matter from
where the water was being bought.
Michael LaMont replied that when the water supply contract was in the design phase, the Office of
Capital Planning and Policy and Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, did look at purchasing water from
the closest municipality or utility group, Midlothian-Markham Water Commission (MidMark Group),
which is the group that supplies water to Midlothian and Markham. Mr. LaMont stated that there is a
premium to purchase the water through Midlothian-Markham Water Commission (MidMark Group). He
further stated that during the course of this project while the new supply system is being installed water
had to be purchased through Midlothian-Markham Water Commission (MidMark Group) as an alternate
to the City of Chicago. In conclusion, Mr. LaMont stated that once the new valve is installed early this
summer, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, will be able to stop paying Midlothian-Markham Water
Commission (MidMark Group) and return to City of Chicago water which will be cheaper.

transmitting a Communication, dated January 5, 2005:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for the Department of Corrections (DOC) Infrastructure
Renovations, Phase 3. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this
request.
Reason:

This project will rehabilitate approximately 1900 linear feet of the underground
utility tunnel, which houses the steam, chilled water, and condensation lines with
their respective return lines that have deteriorated since the tunnel was first built
in 1920. Waterproofing will be performed throughout the length of the tunnel,
along with concrete repair, the addition of pipe supports, supply/exhaust fans,
and the installation of additional light fixtures.

Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 02/01/05.

In response to Commissioner Silvestri's question regarding the tunnel at the Department of Corrections,
Mr. LaMont replied that the goal is to waterproof and rehab 1900 feet of the tunnel that carries the steam
and chilled water lines because there are leaks and the lighting and ventilation are inadequate. Further,
Mr. LaMont stated that it is not unusual to do this type ofrehab in an eighty-five year old tunnel.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what motivated the $4 million expenditure.
Mr. LaMont replied that while the rehab should be done at this time, there is no seriously impending
problem of which he is aware. Overall the underground tunnel is deteriorating and it should be repaired
at this time.

Mr. LaMont replied no, he stated that it was the utility tunnel.
Chairman Sims asked where the seepage was coming from.
Mr. LaMont replied that the seepage is from the moisture in the ground. Further he stated that the pipes .
need to be routed out and pumps installed to remove the standing water.

the County doesn't fully go through the permit process until after we have a contractor or have bid the
job. Further, Mr. LaMont stated that the City of Chicago now allows scheduling of appointments far
enough in advance, so that their comments are included in the document.
Commissioner Silvestri asked the total cost of the building.
Mr. LaMont replied $64.2 million, but he stated that he is forecasting that at the most the project will cost
$55 million or less.

269195

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated January 19, 2005:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a
professional services contract with U. S. Equities Development L.L.C. for master planning
services at the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus. It is respectfully requested that this
Honorable Body approve this request
The master planning services at the Stroger Hospital Campus are necessary in order to
determine how much clinical and administrative space is necessary now and in the future to
support all the medical activities at the Stroger Hospital of Cook County. Although the new
Stroger Hospital is currently handling its patient load well, future expansion space
requirements need to be considered. The ambulatory facilities on the campus, i.e. the Fantus
Clinic, are overcrowded and have outlived their useful life. Administrative space on the
campus is inadequate and it is currently split among three buildings on campus and one offsite leased space. Parking on campus is insufficient to meet demand. The master planning
process will determine the proper number of parking spaces and their location.

791

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2005
The master planning services are the first phase in the final development of facilities at the
campus. The services by the U.S. Equities Development team will consist of the evaluation
and recommendation of the following: the economic re-use of some or all of the old main
hospital building, a replacement primary care facility for Fantus Clinic, options for added
medical/surgical beds on campus. possible expansion of the CORE Center, replacement of
administrative office capacity, expansion of campus parking capacity, freestanding outpatient
pharmacy facilities, space for medical and radiology records, space for Bureau of Health
Services research functions, feasibility of student housing and commercial/retail development
as part of the overall campus plan, and economic reuse potential of the 1900 West Polk
Building, the Hektoen Building and the Durand Building.
The U.S. Equities Development team is comprised of firms and individuals with a vast
amount of experience in healthcare development and some have had recent experience in the
management and design at the Stroger Hospital Campus. The team disciplines will include
program management, architecture, planning engineering, building preservation,
traffic/parking and cost estimating. The team has committed to providing a preliminary
report with recommendations within four to five months of the start of this contract.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,395,000.00. Bond Issue (28000 Account).
Sufficient funds remaining from the old hospital demolition contingency have been
appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 01/20/05.
**Deferred at the 01/31/05 Construction Committee Meeting.
Chairman Sims asked Michael LaMont, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy to give the
Committee a brief overview.
Mr. LaMont explained that the County proposes a professional service contract with U.S. Equities
Development, LLC to conduct a master plan study for the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus.
Further, Mr. LaMont stated that he has forwarded supplemental information to the Commissioners
regarding the scope, the team and the budget in two separate packages. Subsequent to that information
Commissioner Silvestri submitted questions to Mr. LaMont and received responses to his questions with
copies to all Commissioners. Mr. LaMont stated that the scope of the work is the ultimate development
of options for the Commissioners to consider as they move ahead with the second phase of development
of Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus. He stated that when Stroger Hospital of Cook County was
built, the primary focus of Capital Planning and Policy did not concentrate on office space, or research
space or the clinical functions outside of the hospital that are required to support the hospital. The study
that U.S. Equities Development, LLC will be preparing will look at what the hospital campus needs for
space and how these needs will support the hospital over the next forty to fifty years. Once U.S. Equities
Development, LLC has gone through the initial study to determine what is required, they will look at
various options for satisfying these requirements in terms of the type and locations of buildings. U.S.
Equities Development, LLC will present options such as the use of some or all of the old hospital edifice,
as well as other options not utilizing the old hospital. Mr. LaMont stated that when looking at the options
they have to be guided by existing zoning requirements. He further stated that currently the hospital
campus exceeds the land use coverage required by the City of Chicago Zoning Department. Also, the
study will include cost estimates of all options, time-tables and phasing plans which will be presented to
the Commissioners and the Office of Capital Planning and Policy that gives options that can be relied
upon for moving ahead with the project. In conclusion, Mr. LaMont stated that since the study will only
take approximately four to five months, the Commissioners will have the report and hopefully the Board
will have made a decision prior to the next budget cycle so that we can move ahead with the campus and
the needed functions.

792

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2005

Commissioner Gorman asked what constitutes a professional contract versus RFP.
Mr. LaMont replied that a RFP is a mechanism to get a proposal. Mr. LaMont stated that construction
contracts go out for bid and professional contracts are contracts that the President of the County Board
may appoint a professional consultant.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that State Law is clear regarding which contracts are bid. The contracts
that are not required to be bid upon are considered professional service contracts and that the executive
has authority to appoint consultants. The request for proposals is an option that the executive has through
the Board requesting individuals to submit information so they can be selected from a group for a
particular project.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that he would like the letter addressed to Mr. LaMont dated February 3,
2005, and Mr. LaMont's response dated February 7, 2005, to be included in the committee report. (The
referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk).
Commissioner Silvestri asked that alternate plans for the use of the old hospital that were presented by
individuals at previous public hearings be considered by U.S. Equities Development, LLC.
Mr. LaMont replied that he agrees with Commissioner Silvestri, and he will forward all the proposals
presented by each individual to the U.S. Equities team.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that all options should be considered before a conclusion is reached.
Mr. LaMont stated that the U.S. Equities Development team is extremely well equipped and experienced
to undertake this project.
Chairman Sims asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

Chairman Sims asked Mr. Robert Wislow, President, U.S. Equities Development, LLC to give a brief
overview.
Robert Wislow, President, U.S. Equities Development, LLC stated that U.S. Equities Development,
LLC's goal was to assemble a team that had the ability to assess the Stroger Hospital of Cook County
Campus to determine its best possible usage comprised not only of healthcare professionals, architects
and engineers who are nationally renown but other individuals who have experience not only in the City
of Chicago but in and around the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus. This is why U.S. Equities
has assembled Perkins and Will, ESD, and Premier Associates, firms that understand Stroger Hospital of
Cook County and the surrounding campus. Mr. Wislow stated that Soodan Associates is the historic
preservation consultant team on the project. Further, Mr. Wislow stated that although there have been
questions regarding objectivity, the only way to answer these questions is to look at the firm's twentyeight year history, the projects which they have been involved, the reputation that this firm brings to the
project, and the reputation that the other individuals involved with U.S. Equities Development, LLC bring
to the project. Mr. Wislow stated that U.S. Equities Development, LLC has been charged with
objectively assessing the feasibility of the preservation of the building, as well as alternatives and their
relative costs, both from a capital and an operational standpoint. U.S. Equities Development, LLC will
forward to the President and the Board both a short-term and a long-term operating history for all of the
alternatives.

Howard Association

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Law Enforcement and Corrections of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
met pursuant to notice on Tuesday, February 9, 2005, at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room,
Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Patrick Driscoll, Deputy State's Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, State's Attorney's Office, stated
the following: The 1999 and 2000 alleged incidents resulted in civil litigation. The 1999 alleged incident
is not yet settled. The civil litigation deriving from the 2000 alleged incident is set to go to trial later this
month. The litigation pertaining to these two incidents can be discussed in closed session.
Chairman Maldonado specified the procedure he wished to follow: The public speakers would have tento-fifteen minutes to make their presentation, and then the commissioners would have ten minutes to
question the public speakers. If a member wishes to extend their questioning beyond ten minutes, there
will be a second round of questioning.
The Honorable Thomas A. Hett, Investigator for the Extended March 2003 Cook County Grand Jury,
introduced his colleagues, Wayne Milczarek, Grand Jury Foreman for the Extended March 2003 Cook
County Grand Jury and Lawrence Oliver II, Grand Jury Special Investigator for the Extended March 2003
Cook County Grand Jury.
Investigator Hett proceeded to report the following regarding the Grand Jury Investigators' method of
investigation. Sheriff Sheahan was very cooperative in providing the Grand Jury with investigative files
and other documents. The Grand Jurors were allowed full access in touring the Jail. For the purpose of
comparison, a delegation from the Grand Jury also toured Riker's Island Jail in New York City. The
Grand Jury examined statements from approximately 50 witnesses. The Grand Jury also reviewed
allegations contained in three separate law suits that were filed in connection with the two alleged
incidents. The Grand Jury reviewed approximately 100 banker boxes of documents. These documents
included training manuals, general orders, rules, regulations, reports, transcripts and files. Also examined
were media reports, the John Howard Association reports to the Federal Courts regarding jail
overcrowding, the 1989 Trotter Report and the KPMG Report examining the Sheriffs excess force
orders.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2005
Investigator Hett provided the following synopsis of the Grand Jury's findings regarding the February 24,
1999 incident. Members of the Sheriffs SORT team, without any invitation, used excessive force and
falsified reports as to the reason for their incursion. During the course of an internal investigation of this
incident, members of the Cook County Department of Corrections' Inspector General's Office and the
Legal Department attempted to undermine the investigation. While another internal investigation
exonerated these personnel the Grand Jury found the personnel acted in a criminal manner.
Investigator Hett next provided a synopsis of the Grand Jury's finding of the March, 2000 incident. The
Grand Jury found there was no basis for recrimination of the Sheriffs SORT team. The Grand Jury made
22 recommendations, including the following, most of which require funding from the Cook County
Board of Commissioners: that an outside body be formed to oversee grievances and investigations; that
experts be hired to study the grievance process, how the length of stay for an inmate is calculated,
appropriate level of staffing of the CCDOC, and the recruitment of guards for the CCDOC; that the
prisoner classification be upgraded; that the Sheriff commission experts to modernize the rules and
regulations governing the CCDOC; that the CCDOC's computer system be updated in order to provide
modern management tools; that the Sheriff redesign use-of-force training; and that the Sheriff, the Cook
County Board of Commissioners and all other agencies of local government cooperate to relieve the
CCDOC's overcrowding and understaffing.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked what the Grand Jury conceives the role to be today of the Cook County
Department of Corrections Board.
Investigator Hett replied that the Cook County Department of Corrections Board has one role, submitting
names to the Sheriff for Executive Director of the CCDOC.
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether the number of grievances at the CCDOC was inordinate
compared to the number of grievances at Riker's Island.
Investigator Hett replied that such a comparison was not undertaken. However, a statistical analysis was
performed on the grievances filed at the CCDOC. It was found that the burden of proof upon a detainee
was so great that few grievances were advanced to sustained allegations; most grievances were not
processed.
Commissioner Steele asked whether the following is accurate: That the power of the Cook County
Department Executive of Corrections Board is limited to recommending only three names to the Sheriff
for the position of the Executive Director of the Department of Corrections; beyond that the Cook County
Board of Corrections has no statutory powers.
Investigator Hett replied that the Cook County Department of Corrections Board has the statutory power
to make recommendations to the Sheriff, but that the Cook County Department of Corrections Board has
made no recommendation thus far under Sheriff Sheahan 's tenure.
Commissioner Peraica noted that Charles Holman ,gave a deposition on December 1, where he testified
under oath that there were no restrictions on his investigation and that he was told to "let the chips fall
where they may." Further, Mr. Holman was unaware of any fact that would support the assertion that the
Sheriffs Office delayed the investigation. Commissioner Peraica asked Investigator Hett to comment on
this.
Investigator Hett responded that Mr. Holman later testified before the Grand Jury that the aforementioned
was untrue.

801

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2005
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether Mr. Holman indicated he was under duress during his deposition.
Investigator Hett replied in the negative.
Commissioner Peraica moved, seconded by Vice Chairman Silvestri, to enter into the record the
"Sheriffs Office Responses to the Grand Jury's Twenty-two Recommendations." (The referenced
documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk).
Commissioner Peraica asked how Mr. Holman explained the disparate testimonies.
Lawrence Oliver II, Investigator, Extended March 2003 Cook County Grand Jury, responded that Mr.
Holman told members of the Grand Jury that the case was taken from him in June or July of 1999 and
returned to him in May 2001. At that point he told the Grand Jury to "let the chips fall where they may"
because at that point, in his view, the level of criminal exposure was greatly reduced.
Commissioner Moreno stated that he would like to hear from the Sheriff regarding the Extended March
2003 Cook County Grand Jury.
Investigator Hett replied that he had not received any letter from the Sheriffs Office.
Commissioner Moreno replied that he was referring to the allegations set forth in the complaint from
Mandamus, and that he would supply Investigator Hett with a copy of this.
Commissioner Quigley asked whether a sophisticated investigation into allegations could occur outside
the purview of the Sheriffs Office.
Investigator Hett replied that he envisioned a situation wherein the Sheriff would keep the legislation
apprised of the investigation. He noted that after the articles appeared, the Sheriffs Office made changes
in how grievances were handled.
Commissioner Collins asked Investigator Hett to comment on the fact that there was a two-year delay in
the investigation.
Investigator Hett replied that shortly after the 1999 incident, Mr. Holman was instructed to take his
investigation and provide it to the Sheriffs Office, where for two years no one acted on it.
Commissioner Suffredin addressed his question to Wayne Milczarek, Foreman, Extended March 2003
Cook County Grand Jury. Commissioner Suffredin asked whether Mr. Milczarek believed it would be
beneficial for the Chief Judge to appoint grand juries on an ongoing basis to provide oversight of various
governmental agencies.
Mr. Milczarek replied that such an arrangement would be excellent, because it would provide
accountability.
Charles A. Fasano, Director, Prisons and Jails Program, John Howard Association, made a presentation
regarding the Extended March 2003 Cook County Grand Jury Report. Among the John Howard
Association's findings were the following: I-Bonds are not effective in reducing inmate population,
electric monitoring is far more effective; poor maintenance of cell locks in the most violent sections of
the jail leads to violence, the program for repairing these locks should be expedited; the grievance
procedure at CCDOC has been improved, but must be prioritized more highly, for example hiring more
case workers, automating the process, and installing an ombudsman; approximately 1100 inmates
currently sleep on the floor in the CCDOC; while the CCDOC remains understaffed, there is a new
training program that shows promise; length of detainee stay at the CCDOC remains high; and the
management information system needs significant improvement, if manifold, sophisticated reports are to
be created.

802

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2005
Commissioner Butler asked how the John Howard Association obtains various statistics, including the
population number.
Mr. Fasano responded that the John Howard Association receives monthly logs containing population and
bed count, which are prepared by the Sheriffs Office.
Commissioner Butler voiced his concern that the numbers are not obtained directly by the John Howard
Association.
Mr. Fasano responded that this would be cost prohibitive, but that during the rounds the John Howard
Association make weekly to inspect the CCDOC, they obtain (although not directly through their own
observation) divisional head counts, which they cross-check against the monthly logs.
Commissioner Butler asked Zelda Whitler, Undersheriff, Office of the Sheriff, whether she could provide
a cost estimate for the rewiring project at the 26th and California facility.
Ms. Whitler responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Moreno moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
