WAYNE COUNTY TREASURER
CHRISTA J. MCLELLAN KIM L. HOMAN
Deputy DeputyTreasureriLand Management

June 20, 2016

. Dear Wayne County Resident and Fellow Taxpayer:

As your new Wayne County Treasurer, I appreciate the opportunity to introduce myself and provide
you with an update on the progress occurring in my Office. It is a- great honor and privilege for me to
serve as your Treasurer, and it is a responsibility I take seriously;

In April, 2016, after ?ve years with the Treasurer?s Office, having served in the positions of Chief
Deputy Treasurer and Deputy Treasurer of Land Management, Iwas appointed Treasurer. Five years
prior to those positions, I was Chief of the Real Estate and Tax Sections of the Wayne County
Corporation Counsel focusing on real property and tax issues. In total, I?ve provided over thirty
years of public service to Detroit and other Wayne County communities.

On a personal. level, my wife, Badriyyah and I have been married for thirty?six years and are devoted
to our family of three wonderful adult children, daughter?in?law, and granddaughter. We?re looking
forward to another granddaughter later this month. I have been a resident of Wayne County for over
?fty years. Badriyyah and I raised our children here and they have chosen to make their homes here
in Wayne County, as well. We value community service and our'farnily has a long history of
working to help people maintain and restore components in their lives that provide them with the 
dignity they and their families deserve.

The Treasurer?s Of?ce is responsible for the receipt, custody, investment and disbursement of all
county funds on behalf of the-43 municipalities in Wayne County. 1 have a staff of about eighty
people involved in managing all the. ?nance, forfeiture and foreclosure activities. This responsibility
includes investing the County?s funds, assisting taxpayers with foreclosure prevention options, and
conducting the largest tax foreclosure auction in the United States. in addition, the Treasurer?s
Of?ce administers the Delinquent Tax Revolving Fund, which allows the municipalities and other
taxing authorities such as schools, libraries, and parks to continue operating without interruption.

As Treasurer and as a taxpayer myself, one of the most important goals I have set is for all Wayne
County taxpayers to have a positive experience while conducting business with the Treasurer?s
Of?ce. My staff and I are dedicated to serving taxpayers with respect, ef?ciency and
professionalism.

Another important goal is to ensure that people with past due taxes have every opportunity to remain
in their homes. The Treasurer?s Of?ce makes various payment agreement options available for
Wayne County taxpayers facing foreclosures. Currently, owner occupants can bene?t from a. lower
interest rate with a payment agreement; however, the deadline for entering into any payment
agreement is June 30, 2016. We are proactively sending notices and making calls to eligible
taxpayers to inform them about important foreclosure prevention tools. As a result, the number of
parcels headed into foreclosure and auction this year is already lower than last year, and we are
working to ?irther decrease that number before the end of June.

:5

As part of the outreach efforts described above, our phone system is being updated :to- enable callers
to speak directly With a representative during business hours. We have added evening of?ce hours
on Wednesday nights until 6: 30 pm, and we have enhanced our property tax payment process to
include options for residents to pay taxes online or by phone -

I am excited about several innovative projects the Treasurer?s Of?ce is implementing-Itoenhance the
services offered to Wayne County taxpayers.

1.

This summer the Treasurer?s Of?ce will begin accepting delinquent tax payments via- kiosks
that will accept tax payments by cash credit card, and checks. There will be a network of
approximately 30 kiosks placed throughout MetroaDetroit increasing the convenience for
taxpayers.

Our Of?ce is partnering with Gr'eenPath Financial Wellness, a non?pro?t credit counseling
company, to provide taxpayers with the; tools they. need to be successful-gin remaining
compliant with their payment plans and current taxes. GreenPath will provide free credit
counseling services. to taxpayers entering into payment plans and to those Who have. fallen
behind on their current plans. .-It is expected that GreenI?ath will provide services to over
5,000 Wayne County delinquent taxpayers in the next year.

We are fortunate to partner with Michigan State University to launch the ?Innovate Gov?
program. This competitive program will expose college and graduate students to local
government. The interns placed in the. Treasurer?s Of?ce will be tasked with developing and
implementing an innovative way .to- reach ?at risk? taxpayers before they fall into foreclosure.
The students will create a procedure by which my Sta-ff proactively identi?es taxpayers as
soon as they miss a payment, and directs the taxpayers to the resources that best meet their
individual needs. We believe that this program will increase the probability of taxpayer
compliance.

The Treasurer?s Office is again partnering with the Michigan State Housing Development
Authority (MSHDA) to assist eligible taxpayers experiencing ?nancial dif?culty paying their
property taxes. The Step Forward Program is accepting applications directly on theirwebsite
at .and our Of?ce encourages homeowners with delinquent
taxes to take advantage of this program.

 

Other programs are available that include provisions for veterans and clients of the
Department of Human Services.

In closing, thank you for your trust in me as your Wayne County Treasurer. I look forward to
providing enhanced services for all our taxpayers. I welcome your comments, suggestions, and
questions. Please email me at: Our main phone number is
(313) 224?5990, and our website is:
