programs, mental illness, and collaboration among public officials, their offices, and other stakeholders; and

issues impacting the pre-trial system.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Pre-Trial Systems Report of the Criminal Justice Interest

County Board of Commissioners for analysis and discussion.

 WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants,” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is home to over one million immigrants with residents from Latin America, Asia,
Europe and Africa; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has benefitted culturally, socially and economically from the diversity of its

WHEREAS, the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have some of the
world’s highest rates of violence, causing a refugee crisis; and

majority of whom are women and children; and
WHEREAS, Violence against women and children is pervasive and the Central American governments have
failed to protect their citizens; and
WHEREAS, The number of asylum applications from Central American countries to neighboring countries has
increased thirteen fold since 2008; and
WHEREAS, Families and Children, most without access to legal counsel have received removal orders without
having meaningful opportunities to explain their need for legal protection to an immigration judge; and
WHEREAS, Many of these families and children may be eligible for immigration reprieve if they are allowed to
present their cases to the Board of Immigration Appeals; and
WHEREAS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began conducting raids during the 2016 New Year’s
holiday targeting Central American families fleeing violence and children as young as four-years-old; and
WHEREAS, Central American asylum seekers should be treated with the dignity, care and compassion that
every person deserves; and
WHEREAS, immigration raids perpetuate pervasive fear within Cook County, sow distrust of local law
enforcement and raise concerns regarding civil rights violations; and
WHEREAS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recent raids threatens the health of the immigrant
community and all Cook County residents by creating an atmosphere of fear and distrust of governmental
authority; and
WHEREAS, These raids violate basic human rights and threaten the health of all Cook County Residents in
addition to immigrant communities by disrupting clinical, public health and public safety services as recognized
by the American Public Health Association; and
WHEREAS, ICE raids create unnecessary stress and trauma and re-enforce a policy of structural racism that
isolates immigrants; and

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board Of Commissioners hereby reaffirm its
