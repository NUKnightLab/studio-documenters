PROPOSED ORDINANCES

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 28, 2005 from
LARRY SUFFREDIN , County Commissioner
The proposed Ordinance updates the current list of assault weapons banned within Cook County to
include new models introduced to circumvent federal, state and local law. Also, the proposed ordinance
substantially expands the definition of "assault weapon: through the imposition of a characteristic-based
test. A definition based on the characteristics of a fireann eliminates one of the weaknesses of the federal
ban on assault weapons. Finally, the proposed ordinance bans the manufacture, possession and purchase
oflarge capacity magazines that increase the lethality of fireanns.

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 28, 2005 from
LARRY SUFFREDIN, County Commissioner
The County Board is required by law to redistrict after each decennial census to insure that the I 7 County
Commissioner Di stricts are of equal population according to the census data from the U.S. Census
Bureau. The last redistricting plan was approved in 200 l.
This ordinance replaces the boundaries of each district, as defined by technical tracts of land in 200 I, with
boundaries defined by street locations. This ordinance does not affect the boundaries of any district.
Instead, the changes will aid with the codification of Cook County's laws.

Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by
PETER N. SILVESTRI, County Commissioner

GREGG GOSLIN and CARL R. HANSEN, County Commissioners
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, on September 15, 1998, the Cook County Board of Commissioners enacted the Cook
County Living Wage Ordinance to establish meaningful employee compensation for lowest wage
individuals employed by a person or business entity awarded a contract or subcontract with Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, on December I, 2004, said Ordinance was amended to require compensation of the living
wage for services performed or produced by lowest paid individuals employed by a person or business
entity awarded a contract or subcontract with Cook County or by a for-profit person or business entity of
an owner occupied property who receives or renews a Class 6b or Class 9 property tax incentive pursuant
to the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance (Ordinance 02-0-14); and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDTNGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

WHEREAS, there are currently approximately 3,500 units which are certified as supportive living
facilities by the State of 111inois Department of Public Aid, with 1,700 such units being located in Cook
County, and another 3,000 new units are in the planning stages, with 1,500 new units currently planned
for occupancy in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, said 2004 Amendment has created an impediment to the 111inois Supportive Living Program
within Cook County, thereby diminishing a key component of housing and health services for the elderly
and low income populations in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the current ordinance has created a "chilling effect" on possible new units being built in our
county, discourage renewals of Class 6b and Class 9 incentives, and ultimately may place current Cook

LETTER
June 9, 2005
Mr. Gregg Goslin
Cook County Commissioner - 14th District
11 8 North Clark Street, Suite 567
Chicago, IL 60602
Dear Commissioner Goslin,
Thank you for taking the time to meet with me to discuss the outpatient phannacy
services at the Cook County hospitals. As, I mentioned, Walgreens can offer alternative
to increase patient access to their medications and improve the efficiency of the
pharmacies in a cost-effective manner. As part of the proposal, I have separated the
options into short and long term.

2146

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Short term
Since Stroger Hospital is a qualified 340B covered entity, we propose Cook County
submit to the Office of Phannacy Affairs an application for an Alternative Methods
Demonstration Project. The Alternative Methods Demonstration Project gives covered
entities a process to obtain approval to utilize a network of phannacies or use a contract
pharnrncy to supplement an in-house pharmacy. Applications are approved based on
their ability to provide effective methods to improve access to drug therapy and
comprehensive pharmacy services for patients of the covered entity while protecting the
program integrity with inventory and dispensing controls and ensuring statutory and
program compliance.
All small network of Walgreens would be selected as 340B contract pharmacies to
provide convenient locations for patients and would serve as adjuncts to the existing
County phannacies. These pharmacies will be chosen based on zip codes of the patients
to best serve their needs and reduce the workload in the hospital phannacies. Because all
Walgreens are linked to a central database, patient profiles are shared, giving our
pharmacist a complete prescription record. For patients who do not have a convenient
Walgreen retail location, mail service can be provided as another option. Using our
prescription benefits manager, Walgreens Health Initiatives, provides the control of
patients access and inventory management required of 340B programs. Inventory would
be dispensed initially from Walgreens stock and replenished with 3408 purchased
medications and a dispensing initially from Walgreens for each prescription.
Long Tenn
Once the Alternative Methods Demonstration Project is established, Walgreens proposes
acquiring the operation of the Cook County hospital outpatient pharmacies. Acquisition
of the pharmacies would provide revenue to the County from the file purchase and
subsequent lease agreements shift staffing responsibility, system maintenance and
upgrade costs to Walgreens. Pharmacy acquisition can also be chosen as the first option.
A phannacy acquisition would involve:
•
•
•
•

Installing Walgreens proprietary phannacy system, Intercom Plus in each
location.
Completing a full inventory and purchasing any non-340B inventory cost. 340B
inventory will be counted and loaded into our 3408 process for tracking.
Walgreens will acquire any fixtures including furniture, fixtures and equipment.
Employees will be invited to interview for the phannacy positions, and those
hired will be employed as Walgreen employees and are subject to Walgreen
hiring and employment policies and procedures.

All Walgreens are linked to a central database with one record for each patient, regardless
of the Walgreen location. Converting the existing pharmacies to Walgreen locations
would provide a complete patient prescription record, improving patient care and
medication compliance.

2147

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

As an initial setup, I would suggest a small group from Walgreens visit the phannacies to
determine the best course of action and schedule strategy planning meetings with the
appropriate County personnel.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Gregg M. Cygan, R.Ph.
Director, Clinic Pharmacy
Walgreen Health Services

Transmitting a Communication, dated July 1, 2005 from
DANIEL H. WfNSHIP, M.D., Chief, Bureau of Health Services
On June I0, 2005, the Bureau of Health Services released a Request for Proposal (RFP) to group
purchasing organizations (GPO) for pharmaceutical group purchasing services. A notice was published in
the Chicago Tribune and was also posted on the Cook County Government website.
The RFP contained a comprehensive list of the phannaceutical products purchased by the Bureau of
Health Services along with their annual quantities.
On June 27, 2005, the Bureau of Health Services received four (4) responses to the RFP. The responses
were reviewed and analyzed by an evaluation committee comprised of members from the various Bureau
of Health Service facilities. The committee examined each proposal to determine the completeness of the
response, fonnulary match and the overall drug cost.

2165

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Based on the evaluation, it was determined that the University HealthSystem Consortium
(UHC)/Novation LLC., Oak Brook, Illinois, submitted the proposal that offered the highest match to our
drug fonnulary (85%) and the lowest overall cost. In addition, on an annual basis, the proposal was
$1,092,828.00 less than the next acceptable proposal submitted by our current group purchasing
organization, Purchasing Alliance for Clinical Therapeutics (PACT).
I am therefore requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with University
HealthSystem Consortium/Novation LLC., Oak Brook, Illinois for pharmaceutical group purchasing
services. The contract will be for a thirty-six month period and will commence on November 1, 2005.
Since the GPO only provides its members access to their contract pricing, there is no fiscal impact
associated with this contract.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None.
Requisition No. 58900601.

Contract period:

November 1, 2005 through October 31, 2008.

CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication dated, July I, 2005, from
DANIEL H. WINSHIP, M.D., Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend and increase by $7,500,000.00, Contract No.

for the Bureau of Health Services institutions.
$ 4,800,000.00
7,500,000.00
$12,300,000.00

Board approved amount 12-17-02:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

Under the contract, ESI is paid a percentage of the money it is able to bill and collect on the
County's behalf. The agreed upon fee is 7.9% on collections and is totally dependant on
ESI's success in their collection efforts. At the time of execution, the Bureau estimated that
ES! would be successful in collecting approximately $60.6 million over the three-year
contract, and thus, would be entitled to collect $4.8 million dollars in contingency fees.
Because ESI is projected to collect more than was anticipated due to an increase in Pharmacy
prescriptions the Bureau is seeking approval to increase the contract amount by $7.5 million,
in order to pay ESI the 7.9% contingency fee on the additional monies collected on the
County's behalf. Payment to this vendor netted against revenues collected.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $7,500,000.00. Revised Revenue Generating: $80,000.000.00.
period: February 1, 2003 through January 31, 2006.

Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request re-approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loan in the amount of
$1,450,000.00.
Glenview Elderly Programs North, Inc. received a HOME program award of
$ 1,450,000.00 in February 2003 for the construction of an independent senior living development to be
located in Glenview, Illinois. Since the initial application and award, the ownership structure, financing
sources and total project cost have changed. As such, the project must be brought before the Cook
County Board for re-approval. The HOME request and the number of units have remained the same.

2200

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005
Thomas Place will be a 144 unit (73 HOME assisted units) new construction, mixed income elderly
building located in Glenview. The development will be constructed on land donated by the Village of
Glenview at the site of the former Naval Air Station that has been developed into "The Glen." The
development will consist of 73 HOME assisted units and 7 1 non-HOME assisted units. The proposed
construction will consist of one three-story building in a block "A" shape design.
In addition to the HOME loan request, financing for the project will be provided from a variety of
sources: private first mortgage; Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) Trust Fund loan;
Affordable Housing Program grant; equity raised through the sale of Low Income Housing Tax Credits
and State Donation Tax credits; and other sources. The total development cost for the project is currently
estimated to be $28,14 1,059.00. The County's HOME loan request accounts for 5.2% of the estimated
project cost at a cost of $ 19,863.00 per HOME uni t.
T he terms of the HOME Program loan will be structured as a 20-year tenn, 40-year amortization period
loan at I% interest. The County HOME program will receive annual principal and interest payments of
$43,997.00 to be used for other HOME eligible activities.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of
Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents
necessary to further the project approved herein, including but not limited to the HOME Loan agreement
and any modifications thereto. The approval of this loan by this Honorable Body will permit staff to issue
necessary commitments to allow this project to move forward.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: 1,450,000.00. (772-298 Account).

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Collins, moved that the request of the Director of
the Department of Planning and Development be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request re-approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loan in the amount of
$1,950,000.00. Carefree Development LLC, the project's sponsor, received a HOME program award of
$1,950,000.00 in February 2003 for the construction of an independent senior living development to be
located in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. At the time of the HOME award, the project had not received a Low
Income Housing Tax Credit award (LIHTC), a key component of the project's financing.
The project has now received a LIHTC award and all financing is in place. Since the original HOME
award in February 2003 the project has had two changes: the number of units has decreased ( 12 1 down
from 140) and the development team has changed. As a result, the project must receive Cook County
Board approval. The HOME request has remained the same.
The project will consist of one five-story structure containing 121 unfurnished one and two bedroom
apartment units. Designed for independent seniors, the building will address the physical and social
needs of the active elderly.

2201

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

In addition to the HOME loan request for $ 1,950,000.00, financing for the project will be provided from a
variety of sources: an Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) first mortgage; an IHDA Trust
Fund loan; an Affordable Housing Program grant; and, equity capital from the syndication proceeds.
Total development cost for the project is estimated at $20,799, 125.00. The HOME loan of $ 1,950,000.00
represents 9% of the total development budget at a cost of $2 1,667 .00 per HOME unit.
The tenns of the HOME Program loan will be structured as a 40-year fully amortized loan at 1% interest.
The County HOME program will receive annual principal and interest payments of $59, 168.00 to be used
for other HOME eligible activities.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the County of
Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents
necessary to further the project approved herein, including but not limited to the HOME Loan agreement
and any modifications thereto. The approval of this loan by this Honorable Body will permit staff to issue
necessary commitments to allow this project to move forward.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: $1 ,950,000.00. (772-298 Account).

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice for a
public hearing on Thursday, June 30, 2005 , at the hour of I0:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendation is as follows:
271496

COUNTY TREASURER, Maria Pappas, transmitting a Communication:
Pursuant to 50 lLCS 345/1 et seq., the Treasurer's Office is seeking approval to offer credit
card payment services to the taxpayers of Cook County. The Treasurer's Office respectfully
requests that the County Board hold the requisite public hearing to determine whether the
acceptance of credit card payments to satisfy real property tax obligations is in the best
interests of the citizens and governmental administration of Cook County.
A third-party service provider can offer this service to the taxpayers of Cook County at no
cost to the County. Cardholders who choose to pay by credit card would incur a convenience
fee for the service. The convenience fee would wholly offset the costs of processing the
transaction and be paid directly to the service provider. For purposes of real estate tax
collections, the payment of multiple tax bills in a single transaction is prohibited.

*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 06/07/05.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to read the notice of the public hearing into the record.
Chainnan Daley asked Secretary Harris if anyone had registered to testify at this public hearing.
Secretary Harris replied no individuals had registered to testify. Chairman Daley then asked if anyone
present wished to testify. Hearing none, Chaimrnn Daley proceeded with the item on the agenda, a
request fro m the Treasurer's Office seeking approval to offer credit card payment services to satisfy real
property tax obligations. Commissioner Quigley voiced his support for the credit card payment services.
He stated that he has received numerous requests for such services. Commissioner Quigley further stated
that the services provide flexibility, options and convenience.
Comm issioner Suffredin inquired whether the Treasurer' s request to hold a public hearing is the proper
way to be done.
Patrick Driscoll, Deputy State's Attorney, Chiet: Civil Actions Bureau, responded in the affinnative.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired who would be responsible for paying the credit card usage fee to the
credit card company.
Mr. Driscoll replied that the credit card holder would be responsible for this fee.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired what would be the best method to inform the public about the fee.
Mr. Driscoll recommended that a notice be included with each tax bill; this notice should specify that the
fee will vary depending upon the interest rate assigned to each person' s credit card.

2252

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005
Commissioner Suffredin inquired whether this item indicates that the Treasurer's Office would be
responsible for issuing these notices.
Mr. Driscoll replied that this has yet to be determined, but that the Treasurer's Office most likely would
be responsible for the issuance of a notice.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired, under this item, whether a person would have the option of using a
debit card to pay his tax bill.
Mr. Driscoll replied in the negative. He requested that Robert Benjamin, Communications Director,
Treasurer's Office, further respond to this question.
Mr. Benjamin replied in the negative.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that debit cards are often used by the public. He requested that Mr.
Benjamin review this option.
Mr. Benjamin replied that the Treasurer's Office would examine this option for the future.
Commissioner Sims lauded the fact that these services provide the option of paying one's tax bill via the
Internet.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how much the Treasurer' s Office collects yearly in late payment fees.
Mr. Benjamin replied approximately $30 million.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how these services would impact the collection of late fees.
Mr. Benjamin replied that while he has worked with other jurisdictions to determine such an impact, the
discussions have proved inconclusive.
Commissioner Peraica inquired why the Treasurer's Office does not allow credit card holders to pay for
multiple lots in one transaction. He noted that the Statute does not contain this restriction.
Mr. Benjamin replied that this restriction would ensure more simple, clean and easily tracked
transactions.
Commissioner Peraica noted that this restriction would result in both additional expenses for the credit
card holders and additional fees collected by the credit card companies.
Mr. Benjamin concurred.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the Treasurer' s Office currently accepts only one check per lot.
Mr. Benjamin replied in the affinnative.
Commissioner Peraica asked how long this has been in effect.
Mr. Benjamin replied for several years.

2253

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Commissioner Peraica cited Section 345/25b of the Statute, which limits the amount of fees that Cook
County can impose. He inquired how the Treasurer' s Office would work within this framework. He also
inquired whether this is a point of negotiation.
Mr. Driscoll replied that he would defer to Mr. Benjamin on this question.
Mr. Benjamin stated that he had no further information.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether the project will be put out to bid.
Mr. Benjamin replied: The Treasurer's Office will not have enough time to issue and review RFP's to
meet the second installment tax deadline. In order to meet this deadline, the Treasurer' s Office would
like to attach itself to the current Government Payment Services (GPS) contract for bail payments. The
Treasurer's Office plans to have a new contract in place in time for the first installment of 2006.
Chainnan Daley advised that it would be best not to discuss anything which might affect the Treasurer's
Office's negotiations, especially since representatives from GPS were in the audience.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the Office of the Treasurer is adhering to the statutory
requirements.
Mr. Driscoll noted that a home rule ordinance would take precedence over the Statute, but that he knows
of no such ordinance and, therefore, the Statute would control the process.
Commissioner Silvestri voiced his support of the credit card payment services. He requested that Mr.
Driscoll submit in writing to the Board before the next Board meeting how the Statute addresses the
convenience fee question. He inquired how feasible it is to have the services implemented by the second
installment. He further inquired whether these services are only available to individuals, or whether they
are also available to multi tax paying entities.
Mr. Benjamin replied that it is feasible to have the services operational by the beginning of the second
installment. He stated that this assertion is based on various discussions. He further stated that the
services are available to multi tax paying entities, provided they process each payment as an individual
transaction.
Commissioner Maldonado voiced his supp01i of this item . He asserted that, on a percentage basis, there
is no difference between paying for lots separately and paying for them all together.
Mr. Benjamin concurred. He further stated that a third party could utilize credit card payment services.
Commissioner Maldonado gave an example of the severe limits of the Statute: The County could not
charge 2% on a tax bill of $3 ,000.
Mr. Benjamin clarified that the County would not charge anything; this charge would be applied by the
credit suppliers.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether the credit suppliers/collectors would be bound by the Statute.
Mr. Driscoll replied in the affinnative.

2254

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005
Commissioner Maldonado suggested that this aspect of the Statute needs to be resolved before going sole
source.
Commissioner Peraica stated that he needed to correct an erroneous statement that he had made earlier in
the meeting. He cited Statute 345/25b of the Local Governmental Acceptance of Credit Card Act. He
further stated that, regarding real estate, the late fee must be the lower of $40 or 3% of the principal.
Commissioner Gorman voiced her support of the Treasurer's request.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved the
Communication No. 271496. The motion carried. Commissioner Butler voted no.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Thursday, June 30, 2005 at the hour of I :00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 11 8
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois, to consider transfers of funds between accounts, as requested by
various departments of County government.
Chainnan Daley announced an agenda has been distributed which outlines the order of consideration of
the transfer of funds.
Commissioner Suffredin referred to Tab Q of Volume II (Supplemental Data) and inquired whether new
personnel have been hired on an emergency-only basis or whether terminations have resulted in additional
funds which were utilized to hire additional personnel.
Mark Kilgallon, Chief, Bureau of Human Resources, replied: The only criterion for hiring has been
critical need. There is no correlation between terminations and new hires. The 112 critical need positions
under the Bureau of Health Services have been mostly nurses, doctors, technicians and phannacists. The
tenninations include personnel who have resigned or retired.
Commissioner Quigley voiced his approval that significant overtime appropriations were budgeted at the
beginning of the fi scal year. He voiced concern that overtime should be reduced. He inquired as to the
overtime percentage of initial funds.
Donna Dunnings, Director of the Department of Budget and Management Services stated she would
provide this fi gure.
Commissioner Quigley stated that surplus items of over four years duration should be transferred, and
that longstanding vacant positions should be eliminated.
Ms. Dunnings replied: These were budget objectives and would continue to be budget objecti ves for the
Fiscal Year 2006 Budget. Hard-to-recruit, specialty positions, such as those under the Bureau of Health
Services, were not considered for elimination, nor would they be considered for elimination in the Fiscal
Year 2006 Budget.
Commissioner Quigley inquired whether a countywide audit is currently being conducted.
Mr. Kilgallon replied: The Bureau of Human Resources is conducting no audits. The Sheriff's Office,
however, is currently being audited. The Offices of all elected officials are scheduled to be audited. Mr.
Kilgallon agreed to provide projected time lines for these audits; the audi t of the Sheriff s Office is
expected to take one year. A yearly review of each position is conducted by elected officials as well as
by the bureaus and departments under the Office of the President.
Mr. Kilgallon stated that, per his discussion with Industrial Engineers, to conduct a staffing needs audit of
all elected officials' offices as specified by the Board would cost over $1 million.
Chainnan Daley inquired whether this audit would require outside personnel.
Mr. Kilgallon replied in the affinnative.
Vice Chainnan Steele voiced concern that the reduction of overtime has impacted the ability of some of
the County's health facilities to render care, including specialty care.

Commissioner Peraica requested that Dr. Daniel H. Winship, Chief, Bureau of Health Services, detail the
allocation of overtime funds.
Dr. Winship replied: A budget for one-half year was developed; funds were allocated for vacant positions
and then accrued if those positions were not filled. The Bureau is reducing this practice and is budgeting
more accurately for expected line item expenditures.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how many vacant positions there are in the Bureau of Health Services.
Dr. Winship replied approximately 400.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how many phannacists have been hired.
Dr. Winship replied two; he stated that although there has been a concerted effort to hire pharmacists, the
County's non-competitive salaries are problematic.
Commissioner Peraica inquired why funds are not reallocated to make the pharmacy salaries more
competitive.
Dr. Winship replied that such a plan is under development and will require approximately three more
months to complete.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how many of the 48 hired positions at Provident Hospital of Cook County
and Stroger Hospital of Cook County are nurses.
Dr. Winship replied that he did not know that number. He added that the nursing positions are not
exceptionally difficult to fill because the County's nurse salaries are fairly competitive.

registries.
Dr. Winship stated that he is working to address this issue.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired whether any emergency warranting overtime has arisen that has not
been covered by the existing exemption.

2259

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Commissioner Suffredin asked whether the transfers are budget neutral.
Dr. Winship replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Suffredin inquired whether the Bureau could negotiate higher salaries for incoming
phannacists.
Dr. Winship replied that the union contract for all pharmacists would have to be renegotiated and that this
would cause a ripple effect among the other specialists.
In response to Comm issioner Suffredin 's suggestion, Dr. Winship confirmed that his Bureau is recruiting
phannacy technicians from high school training programs, and is considering implementing a higher ratio
of pharmacy technicians to pharmacists.
Commissioner Collins suggested that legislation be pursued that would allow pharmacists to oversee a
higher number of pharmacy technicians. She also stated that the Bureau of Health Services needs to
recruit more nursing assistants.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Dr. Winship provide the Board with the total number of
vacancies, calculated as follows: the number of vacancies specified in the Fiscal Year 2005 Budget in
addition to mid-year vacancies and new hires.
Dr. Winship agreed to provide this infonnation.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether the Bureau hires licensed practical nurses.
Dr. Winship replied in the affinnative; he noted that LPNs are about as difficult to recruit as registered
nurses because there is a large shortage of LPNs.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the 112 new hires stated in the transfer of funds materials is
actually 96 when the 16 new hires under the Office of the President are discounted.
Dr. Winship replied in the affirmative. He added that the 43 new hires listed under the Office of the
President should be discounted as well, so that the actual number of new hires under of the Bureau of
Health Services is approximately 53.
Chainnan Daley inquired whether Dr. Winship is confident that, with these transfers, the Bureau of
Health Services could stay on budget.
Dr. Winship replied in the affinnative.

MBE/WBE Consultant

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Contract Compliance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Tuesday, July 5, 2005 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, I I 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
270506

A RESOLUTION TO CONDUCT AN OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF ALL
CURRENT MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISE/WOMEN'S BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
(MBE/WBE) CONTRACTS TO DETERMINE THE LEGITIMACY OF THEIR CURRENT
MBE/WBE ST ATUS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution
sponsored by Mike Quigley, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the 2000 Census determined that minorities account for 52.4 percent of the
population of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, minority-owned businesses with paid employees constitute only 14.5 percent of
the total number of finns, 2.9 percent of total business sales and receipts, 4.8 percent of total
employees, and 3.6 percent of total payroll in Cook County, according to the 1997 Economic
Census; and
WHEREAS, women-owned businesses with paid employees constitute only I 6 percent of
the total number of firms, 4.1 percent of total business sales and receipts, 7.7 percent of total
employees, and 5. 7 percent of total payroll in Cook County, according to the I 997 Economic
Census; and
WHEREAS, this dramatic under-representation of minorities and women in the economic
life of Cook County is a serious socioeconomic problem; and

2335

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

WHEREAS, the certification of women and minority business enterprises was originally
established in order to help women and minority-owned businesses by increasing their
opportunities and ending the disparity in contracts awarded to women and minority-owned
businesses; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners rightly enacted the Cook County
Minority Business Enterprise/Women's Business Enterprise Ordinance to address the
problem of low minority and women-owned business participation; and
WHEREAS, abuse in the County's minority and women-owned business assistance programs
harms those minority and women-owned businesses which abide by the rules and should be
the legitimate beneficiaries of the Cook County Minority Business Enterprise/Women 's
Business Enterprise Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, recently a sub-contract with a county certified minority business was found by a
federal magistrate to serve no "commercially useful" functi on and has exposed the County to
lawsuits; and
WHEREAS, other local government bodies, such as Maricopa County, Arizona, have
detennined that it is better to outsource their MBE/WBE certification programs because
outsourcing is more cost effective, non-politicized, and objective.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that an outside, independent, audit of all prime
contractors who have subcontractors participating in the MBE/WBE program eoRtraets be
conducted to determine the legitimacy of their current MBE/WBE status, and the degree to
which the prime contractors are adhering to their subcontractor obligations in accordance
with the rules of the MBE/WBE program ; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County should immediately begin the process of
outsourcing the certification of MBE/WBE contractors through a competitive bid process and
that the sole function of the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance should be to
monitor certified MBE/ WBE's compliance with the MBE/WB E program including
performing periodic site visits to MBE/WBE business locations, verifying prime contractor
contractual obligations to subcontractors, and expanding the vendor outreach program.
*Referred to the Committee on Contract Compliance on 04/06/05.
**Deferred and amended at the Contract Compliance Meeting of 04/13/05.

Colette Holt, Attorney at Law and MBE/WBE Consul tant, delivered the following status update of the
project to propose an interim ordinance in construction for women and minority business enterprise
participation:
During the past three months she and her team have completed a substantial portion of the project: The
review of other governments, trial records and evidence is completed. The legal standards section is also
completed. She has begun to draft recommendations and is presently worki ng on a proposed ordinance.
The only remaining area is to detennine the utilization of women and minority-owned firms on the
County' s construction contracts, since the construction program was enjoined by the federal courts in
2000. Her team has identified a partial solution to the problem, including software programs designed to
gather infonnation. These software programs interface with accounts, payroll and purchasing. Hopefully
the County will be able to easily provide an electronic fonnat of the desired reports. Her team conducted
a demo session the week prior to last and a proposal has been drafted. Her team will examine this
proposal, as will the Office of Contract Compliance and the County's MIS Department. She hopes to
complete the entire project within the next several weeks.

2336

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Commissioner Quigley inquired how other minority groups, such as Asian Americans and Arab
Americans, might be included in the Ordinance.
Ms. Holt replied: Judge Moran found that the City of Chicago had enough evidence to warrant a race and
gender conscious program. Judge Moran specifically noted the dearth of statistical and anecdotal
information concerning Asian American contractors in construction. The census data did not separate out
Asians. Nor was the City of Chicago able to locate an Asian American contractor to testify at the trial.
Judge Moran noted in his decision that he was concerned about this situation. Given the litigious nature
of this issue, the City decided to follow the federal model which provides for individualized consideration
for race discrimination; cases are made to the purchasing agent through the certification process. This
certification lasts three years and is not granted on a project basis. The only difference between this
program and a race and gender conscious program is that in the former, certain groups (which exist in the
City's Ordinance) are not presumed to be socially disadvantaged. This can be rebuffed on an individual
basis. Approximately 16 of 17 Asian American firms successfully recertified under individual
consideration. This same procedure is open to Arab Americans and to everyone else.
Commissioner Quigley inquired whether the presence of Asian American discrimination m the City
implies Asian American discrimination in the County.
Ms. Holt replied that in her work drafting the City's Ordinance, she was following the findings of a
federal judge. The County, however, could conduct a disparity study and determine, based on evidence
that Asian Americans are discriminated against. The County could then include provisions for this in its
ordinance. If the County were to conduct a disparity which met the legal requirements, no group would
need to be excluded. No data source however, including the Federal Reserve and the census, separates
out Arab Americans. Testimony alone, however, might prove sufficient for the inclusion of Arab
Americans in the Ordinance.
Commissioner Quigley inquired whether Arab Americans and Asian Americans who have been the
subject of discrimination can contact Ms. Holt.
Ms. Holt replied that she is not conducting a disparity study for the County and therefore she is not
soliciting testimony or new evidence at this time.
Chainnan Steele stated that if anyone wishes to testify before this Committee they are welcome to do so.
Commissioner Quigley voiced his support for the inclusion of specific groups in the interim ordinance,
and then conducting a disparity study to detennine whether these groups should be included on a
continuing basis.
Ms. Holt noted that the federal government does not keep any statistics on businesses by race and gender,
and that this makes disparity studies difficult and expensive.
Commissioner Goslin inquired whether this interim ordinance would address only construction contracts
or other contracts as well.
Ms. Holt replied: This interim ordinance relates only to construction contracts. The impetus for this
interim ordinance was the federal injunction. The drastic reduction of contracts and especially subcontracts assigned to women and minority-owned vendors is sufficient evidence for interim relief.
Commissioner Goslin inquired whether a larger goal is to examine the entire program.

2337

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Commissioner Steele stated that she hopes to accomplish such an overarching examination.
Ms. Holt made the distinction that the construction industry is much more litigious than areas of
commodities and goods and services.
Commissioner Goslin requested that Ms. Holt define a "disparity study."
Ms. Holt replied that a disparity study examines discrimination in the private and public sector against
women and mino1ity businesses. It is designed to meet the strict constitutional test that the federal courts
use for race and gender conscious programs.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether the Asian Community will be included m the MBE
Ordinance.
Ms. Holt replied in the affinnative.
Commissioner Maldonado noted that when the Ordinance was struck down by the Court, minority
participation went down to I % per minority group.
Commissioner Daley asked Ms. Holt to confinn that she is not conducting a disparity study, and that the
interim Ordinance pertains only to construction contracts.
Ms. Holt confinned this.
Commissioner Peraica asked that Ms. Holt provide the Board with a time frame for this project.
Ms. Holt replied that she hopes to complete the proj ect w ithin several weeks. She noted that the County's
lack of an electronic record keeping system has presented sizeable difficulty; the manual system is error
prone and time-consuming. She emphasized the need for an electronic system.
Chaimrnn Steele voiced concern that there is no record keeping system in place for contracts under
$25,000 which are not approved by the Board.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether Ms. Holt would be making any formal recommendations
regarding the technological advancements that Cook County needs to achieve.
Ms. Holt replied the following: The acquisition of technology will be the first and most important
recommendation. Technological advancement would make disparity studies less costly and is necessary
for successful monitoring. In particular, the County needs a way to track subcontractor relationships.
Counties throughout the country are not advanced in tem1s of affirmative action programs; there fore, her
team is not investigating them in tenns of technological models. However, her team recently attended a
demo session of another government' s system that was very promising. The City of Chicago is
investigating the same technology packages.
Ms. Holt specified that the proposed ordinance will require subcontractors to keep demographic records
and will extend audit authority back 5 years.
Commissioner Peraica inquired what the other major recommendations will be.

2338

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Ms Holt replied that the recommendations will address program eligibility; goal setting; and data
collection. She further stated that the report will incorporate legal support to protect the County agai nst
litigation.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how well the County presently could defend itself against litigation given
its manual record keeping system.
Ms. Holt replied that the County could conduct a long discovery process to obtain manual data and could
also utilize data from after the Ordinance was enacted; therefore the County could possibly mount a
successful defense.
Commissioner Maldonado offered the following explanation of the amended proposal: It will allow for
additional staff to enable the Contract Compliance Office to monitor prime contractors as pertains to their
subcontracting activity.
Chairman Steele clarified that while additional staff would improve monitoring, thus far no problem has
been encountered as pertains to monitoring.
Commissioner Quigley stated that not-for-profit organizations exist to perform certification; he also cited
Fortune 500 corporations and governmental entities that outsource their certification processes.
Chairman Steele noted that some of Commissioner Quigley's research may be outdated.
Ms. Holt replied that corporations, unlike governmental entities, do not have to meet strict constitutional
scrutiny. The County has reciprocal arrangements with numerous other governmental entities; this
however is not outsourcing. It is, however, a model in that one government creates a model that other
governments follow.
Commissioner Maldonado voiced the concern that outsourcing might lead to the dismantling of the
County' s Contract Compliance Office.
Commissioner Peraica stated that he believes that there is sufficient staff in the Contract Compliance
Office, but they do not have the necessary data.
Betty Hancock Perry, Contract Compliance Administrator, Office of Contract Compliance replied: Her
Office does not have 900 minority and women business enterprises subcontracts, but rather has 900
company listings. As a result of the April 13, 2005 Contract Compliance meeting, her Office has taken
the following steps:
The Office has reviewed the certification and recertification processes and procedures. The staff has been
restructured. Checks and balances have been implemented. Individual staff are now assigned monitoring
responsibility for those contracts they review. Training sessions have been held to review new
procedures. These procedures will be implemented within two weeks. Her Office has reviewed the new
Schedule A application that was developed and implemented by the City of Chicago. Her Office has
implemented additional City requirements into the Office's Schedu le A requi rements. The staff has
attended City training sessions on Schedule A applications. Her Office has reviewed the certification
processes of Columbus, Houston, Tampa and Maricopa County, Arizona. Her Office has identified that
the certification processes of these governmental entities utilize the same infonnation that her Office
reviews.

2339

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

She stated that her Office opposes the outsourcing of the certification and recertification processes. Her
recommendation is that the County provide her Office with additional staff and technology.
Ms. Hancock Perry provided clarification regarding the steps a vendor takes to become certified.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how many of the listed subcontractors have contracts.
Ms. Hancock Perry stated that her Office provides to the Board, on a semi-annual basis, infonnation
regarding which businesses have worked on County contracts, and the dollar amount that they have
received. She further stated that every two weeks approximately 25 to 30 contracts are awarded. She
enumerated the multiple responsibilities each of her staff has.
Commissioner Quigley inquired what organizations are included in the reciprocal arrangement.
Ms. Hancock Perry replied that these organizations are either not-for-profits or governmental agencies.
Chainnan Steele stated that sometimes a business will have been certified by another governmental
agency, but in the meantime wi ll have been de-certified. This is why the Office of Contract Compliance
now requires every business to certify with the County.
Ms. Hancock Perry noted the following: There is no fee for certification. The County conducts a class to
guide businesses through the certification process. Certification lasts for one year.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Ms. Hancock Perry supply the Board with the percentage of
applicants that are denied certification.
Ms. Hancock Perry agreed to provide this. She also stated that while, prior to the April 13, 2005 meeting,
only 3 persons on her staff were certifying businesses, now the entire staff is being trained to do
certification. Further, Ms. Hancock Perry stated that her Office has detennined that its staff must conduct
more site visits of subcontractors.
Chainnan Steele stated that the Board most likely will need to provide additional travel funds to the
Office of Contract Compliance for travel.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired what steps Ms. Hancock Perry' s Office is taking to curtail the
practice of prime vendors exploiting subcontractors.
Ms. Hancock Perry replied that her Department has just begun a review of the monitoring practice. She
stated that, c urrently, her Office contacts both the contractor and the subcontractor to elicit payment
infonnation. Usually, however, responses from subcontractors are not forthcoming unless there ts a
problem. If a subcontractor claims they are being exploited, an investigation ensues.
Commissioner Maldonado stated two areas of concern: When a subcontractor does not reveal that it is
being exploited because it is afraid that it will not be used in the future by the prime contractor. And
when the subcontractor does not believe it will actually be reimbursed for payments not made.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to defer Communication
No. 270506. The motion carried.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Vice Chairman Moreno, moved approval of Amendment
#J to the Proposed Resolution (Comm. No. 271173). The motion carried.
Commissioner Hansen acknowledged that the U.S. Immigration System needs refonns. He further stated
that the current system demeans participants and breaks up families. He noted, however, that poorly
regulated immigration flow raises the unemployment rate.
Chainnan Murphy stated that perhaps the Resolution can be a first step in immigration refonn. She
further stated that any Congressional bill would prove most effective if it addressed immigration refonn
on a case-by-case basis.
Commissioner Sims voiced her support of the Resolution.
Commissioner Moreno voiced his support of the Resolution. He emphasized that undocumented workers
contribute to both the work strength and the tax wealth of the United States.
Commissioner Maldonado stated the following: There is bi-partisan Congressional support for this issue.
The issue contains enough common ground that a bill most likely will be enacted by next year. Anyone
eligible for this bill must have paid taxes, learned English and obeyed the law. The existing language of
"The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act," addresses the issue that foreign workers should not
be allowed to undercut job availability. He stated that 77% of Americans support this type ofrefonn.

Chairman Maldonado thanked all of the public speakers for taking the time to come out and testify at the
public hearing.
Chairman Maldonado stated that in the past no one has complained about Cook County's quality of care,
but everyone knows that there are some problems. What we heard from the public speakers ' statements is
that there are problems within the phannacy management system, and there are issues with customer
service within the pharmacy. These customer service issues also exist throughout the County clinic
system both inside and outside of the hospital. Further, Chainnan Maldonado stated that what the
Commissioners want the Administration to hear is that there is a pharmacy management system that is not
working properly and that needs to be addressed; and it is time that the Administration starts to identify
some solutions. Everyone on the County Board is willing to be responsive and supportive of the
proposed solutions that will come from the Administration. Chainnan Maldonado stated that for many
years the County Board has not been told the truth regarding the problems with the pharmacy and because
the truth has not been told, some of these issues have gotten out-of-control. In closing, Chairman
Maldonado stated that he will be introducing two Ordinances, one of the Ordinances will be to restore the
overtime for Phannacists and the second Ordinance will be to increase the salary of the Phannacists.
Chairman Maldonado stated that he is disappointed with the Administration because when he was
scheduling the public hearing, he wanted to have the meeting in the first floor conference room.
However, the Chainnan was told that it was blocked using the excuse that it would become a security
issue. Therefore, he was told that as a substitute, the meeting could be held in the Administration
Building or in the Hektoen Building. The Chainnan further stated that this was a tactic to try to dissuade
the patients from coming or from candidly telling the Commissioners how they feel about the phannacy
system.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the one thing that bothered him the most about the hearing was the
testimony regarding the culture of what goes on at the hospital. He cited the commentary that " if it's
free" you should not complai n because as we all know there is no such thing as a "free lunch" or a •·free
prescription." Further, Commissioner Silvestri stated that he hopes that the Administration will work
very diligently to talk to staffs who work in the system to try to ascertain the severity of the morale and
the attitude that is shown to patients. He further stated that everyone should be respected no matter what
their socio-economic background is and most certainly the staff that works at the hospital should be
respected. Everyone should work together to make the Hospital a better place. In conclusion,
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the Commissioners or the Administration cannot solve the problem
that the pharmacy is facing by thinking in traditional ways. He stated that the phannacy is not a traditional
place like Walgreen 's or CVS. It is a very unique place that is going to need unique and creative
measures to make it better. ln closing, Commissioner Silvestri stated that there has to be a way that Cook
County can work with the Federal Government and through Congressional Legislation to change the laws
so that these patients are able to go to their local phannacies and receive the same benefits as they receive
here at Stroger Hospital of Cook County. Further, Commissioner Silvestri stated that the County should
be working with the private pharnrncies to make some type of arrangement so that these patients can
receive their prescriptions in the neighborhoods where they live.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Commissioner Steele stated that the patients should be informed about the options available to them, and
doctors should inform their patients about alternative methods to receiving their medication.
Commissioner Steele further stated that there is no reason why any employee of Stroger Hospital of Cook
County should demonstrate a lack of respect for patients; this should be emphasized and made a priority.
She also stated that the telephone system is a disgrace, a fact that she has brought up previously in the
Stroger Hospital of Cook County meeting. She suggested that there should be a system that monitors all
in-coming calls and records how long it takes an employee to answer that call. Regarding the staff
shortage, she stated that something must be done to accommodate the current staff.
Commissioner Steele stated that some of the positions that were cut during the FY 2005 Budget need to
be restored, and the Hospital Administration needs to stand up to the County Board and tell the Board the
truth about what they need to run the hospital in a more efficient way. In conclusion, Commissioner
Steele stated that the employees of the hospital should be made aware that the hospital will be holding
customer service training and that attendance is mandatory.
Commissioner Peraica stated that the problem at the hospital rests with President Stroger, the
Commissioners and Dr. Winship. Commissioner Peraica stated that $300,000.00 was spent to have
consultants prepare a study on janitorial problems at Stroger Hospital of Cook County, and that those
funds could have been used to pay prevailing rates to the pharmacists who are under-paid according to
industry standards.
Commissioner Collins stated that she was grateful for the education she had received at the meeting from
the patients. Further, Commissioner Collins stated that she will be meeting with the Hospital
Administration to discuss workable solutions to some of the problems that the patients mentioned at the
meeting.
Commissioner Butler stated that when he suggested to Chairman Maldonado to have the meeting at the
hospital subsequent to having the meeting at the County Board, he stated that he had the following things
in mind: that all of the parties should be involved and talk about the problems that are occurring at
Stroger Hospital Phannacy; that this is not just an Administrative problem but a problem of the entire
Board because it is a County Hospital; and that everyone on the Board should take responsibility for it.
Further, Commissioner Butler stated that the County Commissioners individually are limited in what they
are able to do because it takes at least nine Commissioners to pass an item. In conclusion, Commissioner
Butler stated that anyone who has concerns as to what is happening at Stroger Hospital of Cook County
shou ld come to the County Board meetings and be vocal to those Commissioners who get the headlines
when they speak about " Refonn Government" but who are not willing to raise taxes. Commissioner
Butler concluded by saying that the only things that the Commissioners can raise are fees and taxes in
order to make sure those employees are paid.
Commissioner Daley thanked Chainnan Maldonado for holding the meeting. He stated that he had
learned a lot by listening to the patients. Further, Commissioner Daley stated that he would like to thank
the nurses for working under tough conditions. Commissioner Daley stated that in reference to the
Overtime Policy Resolution, there is a clause in the resolution that states that there is an exemption in
case of an emergency, and that the emergency clause should be looked at closely. In conclusion,
Commissioner Daley stated that what has occurred at Stroger Hospital of Cook County is failure to
communicate, and the Administration is willing to work with the County Board and the patients to resolve
the problem.

2351

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

Commissioner Suffredin stated that he would like to ask Dr. Winship to write a memorandum to the
County Board answering some of the issues that were stated at the meeting, along with some solutions
that he recommends based upon the testimony that was heard. Further, Commissioner Suffredin stated
that he disagrees with Commissioner Butler, because there is another source from which revenue is
generated i.e., the Federal Government and that healthcare is a national responsibility. In conclusion,
Commissioner Suffredin stated that Cook County is a unique unit of local government that provides an
institution such as Stroger Hospital of Cook County. There is no other hospital or health system in the
country like Stroger Hospital of Cook County, and that additional funds are needed from the Federal
Government.

Commissioner Peraica moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Murphy. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

The Village of Palos Park intends to use the parcels as a park or associated recreational uses.
The short term plans are to develop the area as a new green space, including bike paths that
will connect with paths in Palos Heights and eventually Lemont. We have entered into a
lease agreement with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District for land adjacent to these
parcels, which would enhance the land available for this purpose. The long term goals are to
develop a multi-museum exhibition facility to be used by some or all of the major museums
in Chicago. By doing so, the Village of Palos Park believes that this use will serve as an
educational, recreational and cultural facility to serve its own residents, residents of
Southwest Cook County and hopefully beyond.
As part of the application for no cash bid parcels, the following has been submitted:
I . A certified copy of a Resolution authorizing a no cash bid on the above-named parcels,
which includes a statement of benefits for our municipality and affinnation that legal
counsel has been retained and that all legal and other costs will be borne by the Village of
Palos Park; and
2.

Four tract searches and name judgment searches of the owner of record of each parcel;
and

3. A copy of the Sidwell Map with the parcels marked; and
4.

Photographs of the above-named parcels.

There is no third party requestor involved with this no cash bid.

The Village of Homewood has approved a three building multi-family development by
DeBello Builders, Inc. on property adjacent to the Subject Property. However, DeBello's
proposed project does not have sufficient land to create a necessary detention area as required
by the Homewood Stormwater Management provisions of its Municipal Code. Should the

the Subject Property to DeBello Builders, Inc. for use as a detention area to satisfy the
Village' s Stormwater Management requirements. This wi ll allow DeBello's multi-family
proposed development to proceed, which will in tum, improve the Village's tax base and
provide additional multi-family availability within the Village.

requested tax deed for the delinquent parcel and the Village will pay all legal and other costs
associated with the acquisition of the parcel.

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 29, 2005 from
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
I am hereby requesting adoption of the Ordinance establishing the Cook County Homeownership
Initiative and the authorization and execution of a Community Loan Program Agreement with
CitiMortgage, Inc. and certain documents in connection with the Cook County Homeownership Initiative.
The Cook County Homeownership Initiative will assist in making home purchases more affordable for
families and individuals, including those of low-to-moderate income. The Program will allow qualified
homebuyers to secure both a First Mortgage Loan and a Second Mortgage Loan offered by participating
approved community lending institutions. The First Mortgage Loan is a market rate product priced daily
through CitiMortgage, Inc., as the Program' s Servicer. In addition to providing a lender source for the
First Mortgage Loans, the Program allows the homebuyer to borrow funds - up to 7% of the sale price- in
the form of a Second Mortgage Loan. The proceeds from the Second Mortgage Loan can finance all or a
portion of, required down payment costs, closing costs and/or recurring (prepaid) costs associated with
the purchase of a home. The first and second mortgage Fannie Mae Conventional Loans shall be funded
entirely by the Servicer/Lender. The County may fund Second Mortgage Loans on FHA initiated first
loans pending HUD approval. CitiMortgage, Inc. commits to fund the purchase of up to $10,000,000 in
Second Loans and the full amount of the related First Loans to Lenders for the benefit of qualified
homebuyers within the County.

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
REGARDING THE MASSACRE AT SREBRENICA IN JULY 1995
WHEREAS, in July I 995 thousands of men and boys who had sought safety in the United Nationsdesignated "safe area" of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina under the protection of the United
Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were massacred by Serb forces operating in that country; and
WHEREAS, beginning in April 1992, aggression and ethnic cleansing perpetrated by Bosnian Serb
forces, while taking control of the surrounding territory, resulted in a massive influx of Bosnians seeking
protection in Srebrenica and its environs, which the United Nations Security Counci l designated a "safe
area" in Resolution 819 on April 16, 1993; and
WHEREAS, the UNPROFOR presence in Srebrenica consisted of a Dutch peacekeeping battalion, with
representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of
the Red Cross, and the humanitarian medical aid agency Medecins Sans Frontiers (Doctors Without
Borders) helping to provide humanitarian relief to the displaced population living in conditions of
massive overcrowding, destitution, and disease; and
WHEREAS, Bosnian Serb forces blockaded the enclave early in I 995, depriving the entire population of
humanitarian aid and outside communication and contact, and effectively reducing the ability of the
Dutch peacekeeping battalion to deter aggression or otherwise respond effectively to a deteriorating
situation; and
WHEREAS, beginning on Jul y 6, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces attacked UNPROFOR outposts, seized
control of the isolated enclave, held captured Dutch soldiers hostage, and after skinnishes with local
defenders, ultimately took control of the town of Srebrenica on July I 1, 1995; and
WHEREAS, an estimated one-third of the population of Srebrenica, including a relatively small number
of soldiers, made a desperate attempt to pass through the lines of Bosnian Serb forces to the relative
safety of Bosnian-held territory, but many were killed by patrols and ambushes; and

2369

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 12, 2005

parts of northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control; and
WHEREAS, the massacre at Srebrenica was among the worst of many horrible atrocities to occur in the
conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina from April 1992 to November 1995, during which the policies of
aggression and ethnic cleansing pursued by Bosnian Serb forces with the direct support of authorities in
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) ultimately led to the displacement of more

abused, and the innocent civilians of Sarajevo and other urban centers repeatedly subjected to shelling and
sniper attacks; and

Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, should be solemnly remembered and honored; and

(2) The policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing as implemented by Serb forces in Bosnia and
Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 meet the terms defining the crime of genocide in Article 2 of the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; and
(3) Foreign nationals, including United States citizens, who have risked and in some cases lost their lives
in Bosnia and Herzegovina while working toward peace should be solemnly remembered and honored;
and
(4) The United Nations and its member states should accept their share of responsibility for allowing the
Srebrenica massacre and genocide to occur in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 by failing to
take sufficient, decisive, and timely action, and the United Nations and its member states should
constantly seek to ensure that this failure is not repeated in future crises and conflicts; and
(5) It is in the national interest of the United States that those individuals who are responsible for war
crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions,
committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, should be held accountable for their actions; and

(6) All persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) should
be apprehended and transferred to The Hague without further delay, and all countries should meet their
obligations to cooperate fully with the ICTY at all times; and
(7) The United States should continue to support the independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, peace and stability in southeastern Europe as a whole, and the right of all people living in
the region, regardless of national, racial, ethnic or religious background, to return to their homes and
enjoy the benefits of democratic institutions, the rule of law, and economic opportunity, as well as to
know the fate of missing relatives and friends.
