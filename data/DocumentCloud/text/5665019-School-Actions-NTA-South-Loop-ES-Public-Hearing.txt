 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Chicago Public Schools (CPS) is investigating how best to serve its Pre-K through 12th grade
students in the Near South Side. One proposal under consideration is moving the attendance boundary
for the South Loop Elementary School (South Loop) and converting National Teachers Academy (NTA)
into a neighborhood high school serving the South Loop, North Bronzeville, Chinatown, Armour
Square, and Bridgeport neighborhoods. In May 2017, CPS introduced a preliminary framework to
gradually convert NTA into this neighborhood high school. The CPS Transition Plan (provided in
Appendix A) proposes to move the Pre-K to 3rd grades to the new South Loop Elementary school in fall
2019. For students in grades 4–8, it provides an option for them to either remain at NTA through the
remainder of elementary school and high school, or to transition to South Loop. Under this plan, the
first cohort of 9th graders would attend the NTA high school beginning in fall 2019, adding a grade level
each subsequent year. It is important to note that all NTA students are guaranteed a seat in the new
proposed high school, regardless of where they live. The proposed high school would have a traditional
neighborhood school boundary with the addition of a preference boundary that will provide families
living just outside the neighborhood boundary with first access to any available seats after students in
the neighborhood boundary enroll. Students living in the current South Loop and NTA boundaries are
guaranteed a seat at the new high school because they reside within the proposed neighborhood
boundary. The other elementary schools that fall within the proposed neighborhood boundary are
Drake, Haines, Healy, and Ward. The proposed preference boundary incorporates the following
elementary school boundaries – Armour, Holden and Pershing.
In December 2017, CPS commissioned a study to understand the implications of this proposal.
The goal was to describe the potential impacts, both positive and negative, that this proposal may have
on various stakeholders in the Near South community and make a series of recommendations. This
report summarizes the findings and is framed around seven critical areas for equity: (1) Family and
Community Engagement, (2) School Climate, (3) Culturally Relevant Leadership Practices, (4) StudentCentered Learning, (5) Diverse Staff of Excellent Educators, (6) Equitable Student Access, and (7) Fiscal
Equity.
Executive Summary

i

 Westat utilized a multi-method approach to this task, combining information from focus
groups1, interviews, a document review (including the CPS Transition Plan), and an analysis of CPS
enrollment data (see Appendix B for the full Methodology). Interviews were conducted with CPS
leaders, elected officials and community stakeholders identified by CPS and community groups. Focus
groups were conducted with parents and educators from both South Loop and NTA. Additional focus
groups were conducted with parents of students of other elementary schools which are in the
proposed boundary of the new high school. It should be noted that focus group participants are a
convenience sample and have self-selected to participate. The views expressed by participants are
therefore not necessarily representative of the wider community, but are nevertheless valuable in
identifying important issues relevant to the CPS proposal.
Our analysis demonstrates that a myriad of concerns, opportunities and challenges have arisen
from the CPS proposal. In many cases the issues are not new and are known to CPS. Some have been
addressed in the Transition Plan. What we present are issues that remain to be addressed as CPS
reviews its next steps in implementing the plan. High level findings with their requisite challenges are
presented below by equity indicator, followed by a series of process recommendations.
What are the key findings, challenges, and opportunities in the area of family and

community engagement?
1. A high level of mistrust of CPS leadership and a significant level of acrimony
between the two communities currently exist.
2. Only 3 percent of students attend their neighborhood high school with the
remaining students dispersed throughout the city to 117 other schools. This

Westat conducted seven one-on-one interviews and eight focus groups of parents and educators representing affected schools and
communities. Interviews were conducted with the following: Three CPS school and district leaders, one elected official, two community
representatives, and one community organizer. Focus groups included:
•
South Loop Parents (two focus groups with a total of 24 participants)
•
National Teachers Academy Parents (two focus groups with a total of 32 participants)
•
South Loop Educators (one focus group with 13 participants)
•
National Teachers Academy Educators (one focus group with 15 participants)
•
Outlying Boundary Parents (two focus groups representing Chinatown, Drake, Healy, Haines, and Bronzeville, with a total of 15
participants)

 scattering of students throughout the city is a challenge for maintaining and
improving family and community engagement with the schools.
3. There was a high level of agreement that having a neighborhood high school
would be a significant benefit because parents would more easily be able to engage
in school activities which contribute to a stronger sense of community.
Key Recommendations: One of the priorities of successful schooling is to engage and partner
with the families and community stakeholders through genuine, purposeful, deliberate, and sustaining
ways. The mistrust of CPS leadership and the acrimony between neighborhoods must be addressed for
the proposed plan to be implemented successfully. Participants agreed that the strongest
recommendation was for CPS to authentically listen to all constituent voices, be transparent in the
decision-making process, and “over-communicate” with parents. The Transition Plan outlines a process
to create a joint Culture and Climate Team from both elementary schools to engage parents and school
staff in creating a shared vision for the future. We suggest using interactive and structured protocols
like, but not limited to, Open Space Technology, Problems of Practice, learning circles, customized
gallery walks with highly skilled and trained facilitators to ensure all voices are heard and valued. In
addition, we suggest that the Principal Transition Coordinator (PTC), collaborate with the school
principals to identify a number of ways in which parents and community stakeholders can actively
participate in creating this shared vision.
EQUITY
AREA:
SCHOOL
CLIMATE

What are the key findings, challenges, and opportunities in the area of school
climate?
1. The concept of ‘integration’ was met with intense resistance, where some
parents felt that having one “welcoming school” and one “closing school” will result
in one school losing its identity. The challenge will be to merge two schools that
have distinct educational philosophies and strong relationships with their respective
communities.
2. CPS views the merging of the schools as an opportunity to “strengthen
educational options,” with the added benefit of providing schools with the
opportunity to learn from each other. The challenge is assuring parents that their

Executive Summary

 children would not lose the very educational philosophies that made their individual
schools successful.
3. NTA and South Loop may be addressing disciplinary incidents in different ways.
While NTA had more students involved in more disciplinary incidents than South
Loop, those incidents that occurred at South Loop were of greater severity. The
challenge will be to integrate these potentially differing philosophies to serve the
best interests of all students.
4. Despite the outreach efforts of CPS (including more than 25 small group
meetings and emails to parents and community members), the details of the
Transition Plan are not well understood by community members. The challenge will
be finding ways to effectively communicate detailed information with the
community.
Key Recommendations: In order to facilitate a positive school climate in which both the adults
and students take ownership in creating and maintaining a harmonious, welcoming, and inclusive
school community, both school identities would need to be transformed into a new identity that
develops and nurtures all students. Early in the transition process, staff and student representatives of
the new school need to collaboratively discuss their new vision for a school climate and culture that
continues to honor creating and maintaining a safe space for all students that is harmonious,
welcoming, and inclusive. A critical part of this effort will be ensuring that NTA students continue to
receive the equitable services, culturally responsive teaching, and social-emotional support that they
currently enjoy. The Transition Plan acknowledges many of these challenges and takes some initial
proactive steps to address them through allocation of funding, resources and support. Working in
partnership with community members, the existing plan will need to evolve into a detailed action plan
with metrics of success, benchmarks, and timelines, but will also have to be purposefully and
repeatedly disseminated.

relevant leadership practices?

Executive Summary

iv

 1. The CPS Transition Plan provides funding to support school leadership during the
transition period. It provides for a transition coordinator who would work with
principals to provide the supports identified by the Culture and Climate Team.
2. Both NTA and South Loop participants were concerned about the loss of familiar
leaders if the transition takes place. The challenge is one of assuring parents that
their children would not lose the leaders and leadership philosophies that made
their individual schools successful.
Key Recommendations: We also recommend that CPS employ a suite of culturally relevant
leadership practices, including the provision of purposeful, ongoing, job-embedded, and sustained
professional learning that supports the shared vision for cultural responsive and culturally relevant
pedagogy. In addition, provide readily available resources, tools, professional learning communities,
learning modules, and engaging and interactive activities that support the ways in which the entire
faculty and staff will practice culturally relevant leadership to ensure all students are valued, honored,
and celebrated.
EQUITY
AREA:
STUDENT
LEARNING

What are the key findings, challenges, and opportunities in the area of studentcentered learning?
1. Students are currently academically successful in both NTA and South Loop
school settings.
•

While NTA serves a significantly larger disadvantaged population, both schools
are rated as 1+ by CPS, and both are categorized by CPS as having “above
average” 2 year to year growth in test scores.

•

After controlling for poverty, demographics, and other factors, 3 South Loop
students scored significantly higher on spring 2017 MAP reading and math

Student Growth measures the change in standardized test scores between two points in time, in this case between spring 2016 and
spring 2017. This growth is compared to the average national growth for schools that had similar scores in 2016. A 50th percentile score
means the school grew at the same rate as the national average. http://cps.edu/Schools/Find_a_school/Pages/findaschool.aspx

 assessments than their NTA counterparts. There was no significant difference
when looking at year to year growth.
•

Neighborhood, economically disadvantaged, and African American South Loop
students scored significantly higher in math and reading than their NTA peers
in Spring 2017. However, there are no significant differences when year to year
growth scores are examined.

2. NTA parents firmly believed that a holistic, whole child approach benefits their
children’s overall well-being as well as their academics. The challenge is ensuring the
benefit of a holistic approach and acknowledging the perception of the potential loss
of this approach as a grave concern for some parents.
Key Recommendations: Tailoring instructional academic programming with the student at the
center of the planning, development, delivery, assessment, reflection, and evaluation phases is an
ongoing, cyclical practice of successful schooling. In addition to the student supports outlined in the
Transition Plan, we also recommend that CPS provide support and technical assistance to school
leaders and teachers on the differentiated ways instruction can be tailored to meet students’ individual
learning needs based on in-depth data analyses. In addition, CPS should ensure that teachers have
flexibility in the multiple approaches that have been successfully employed at both schools to support
student-centered learning for continued student academic success.
What are the key findings, challenges, and opportunities in the area of diverse
EQUITY
AREA:
EDUCATORS

staff of excellent educators?
1. Both NTA and South Loop have the same level of diversity in their teaching staff.
There are no statistically significant differences in the racial and ethnic makeup of
each school’s teacher cadre. There is a great opportunity to staff the new
elementary school with exemplary and diverse educators from both NTA and South
Loop, if the proposal is approved by the board.
2. NTA parents directly tied the dedication of the faculty and staff to the academic,
social, and emotional well-being of their children.

Executive Summary

 3. There was great uncertainty regarding the process of selecting faculty, staff, and
administrators for the proposed new school.
4. The Transition Plan acknowledges the need for purposeful staffing of the new
school with high-quality administrators and teachers trained in equity issues, holistic
instructional methodologies, and transition/change dynamics. Nevertheless, NTA
parents and educators worry that the teachers and staff at the new school would
not be equipped to effectively handle the needs of the NTA population of students.
Key Recommendations: We strongly recommend that CPS communicates a clear and equitable
plan for staffing the new elementary school with administrators and teachers from both existing
schools. Though the PTC supports an exemplary leadership model, we encourage CPS to further
explore multiple leadership models. For example, lead principals for the new elementary school can
collaboratively implement a shared leadership approach to support the entire multi-school campus.
These lead principals will also work collaboratively with the PTC and new high school principal for
successful transition and continuous support through a shared leadership model.
What are the key findings, challenges, and opportunities in the area of equitable
EQUITY
AREA:
ACCESS

student access?
Consistently, participants expressed reservation regarding the proposed NTA
conversion. The widespread impression among focus group participants was that a
successful (i.e., 1+ rating) school was being sacrificed for the promise of a high
school. CPS leadership acknowledges these concerns and stresses that it is a merging
of two 1+ schools and that equitable opportunities for access will not diminish.
1. All interviewees and focus groups agreed that having a neighborhood high
school is extremely valuable and agreed that being able to spare their children from
the stressful high school selection process was a significant benefit. That said, focus
group participants consistently expressed concern that existing high schools were
being neglected in favor of establishing a new high school for a wealthier
neighborhood. The Transition Plan acknowledges that it also seeks to rectify a

 historical wrong though this proposal. There is also an opportunity for the district to
communicate the support services it provides to the existing high schools.
2. While students are currently zoned to Phillips or Tilden (both level 2 schools)
only 55 out of 2,032 attended them in 2017-18. The remaining students attended
117 other high schools, travelling an average of 3.8 miles to school each way
(ranging from 0.1 to 13.5 miles). If NTA is converted into a high school, this creates
an opportunity to reduce travel distance by nearly two-thirds: to 1.3 miles.
3. Participating parents from outlying boundaries were excited about the prospect
of having a state-of-the-art high school nearby. However, they were concerned that
there would not be enough space and no priority status for them. Our analysis of
CPS data indicates the maximum capacity of the proposed high school would be 88
percent, leaving 220 available slots for the rest of the city, a positive
benefit/opportunity.
Key recommendations: Though the Plan and January 8th press release clearly describes that the
new high school will serve students in the Near South Area, we encourage CPS to further reassure
parents that this includes students from Chinatown, Bridgeport, North Bronzeville, and South Loop.
What are the key findings, challenges, and opportunities in the area of fiscal
EQUITY AREA
FISCAL

equity?
1. NTA parents and educators were distressed because they perceived that all the
resources which had been put into making NTA a 1+ rated school would be lost.
2. Participants in all focus groups questioned how resources would be provided to a
new school when parents feel that resources have not been available to improve
existing high schools.
3. The CPS Transition Plan allocates $3.5 million to fund transition and support
mechanisms for students through graduation. Upon reading a summary of the
Transition Plan, participants were confused about the allocation of the funding,
many thinking that the funding would also be used for establishing the new high
school.

Executive Summary

viii

 Key Recommendations: Equitable school funding is a critical component to achieving equity,
and the opportunity to more clearly illustrate the district’s commitment to fiscal equity (beyond what
is outline in the Transition Plan) will benefit the entire the school community. Therefore, we
recommend that CPS further clarify and communicate the financial implications of the Transition Plan.
Specifically, CPS would need to provide details of how the $3.5 million will be allocated, and to
communicate this information using multiple methods.
Our analysis identifies continuing potential challenges, issues and opportunities confronting CPS
as they construct their transition plan. As we are more than a year away from actual implementation,
many of the concerns raised can be addressed through inclusive planning, utilization of multiple and
diverse communication channels, and a collectively agreed upon sense of what short term and long
term success for all students can be. The equity concerns will always be present, should be identified
and monitored, and action taken to address inequities when they exist. The request for this analysis is
a responsible step in this process.

 INTRODUCTION
As the population of the Near South neighborhoods continues to grow, Chicago Public Schools
(CPS) is investigating how best to serve its Pre-K through 12th grade students. One proposal under
consideration is moving the attendance boundary for the South Loop Elementary School (South Loop)
and converting National Teachers Academy (NTA) into a neighborhood high school serving South Loop,
North Bronzeville, Chinatown, Armour Square, and Bridgeport neighborhoods. In May 2017, CPS
introduced a preliminary framework to gradually convert NTA into this neighborhood high school
starting in the fall of 2019. NTA is a top-rated Pre-K–8 elementary school located at 55 W Cermak Road
that currently serves 723 students (in SY 2017-18). It also has a Regional Gifted Center (RGC) program
for students in grades K–5. South Loop is also a top-rated K 4-8 elementary school located at 1212
South Plymouth Ct. that currently serves 780 students. South Loop also has an RGC program currently
serving students in grades 6-8.
The full Transition Plan is provided in Appendix A. It provides the option for NTA students in
grades 4 and above (in fall 2019) to either remain at NTA through the remainder of elementary school
and high school or to transition to South Loop. Students in grades K-3 as of the 2019-20 school year do
not have the option to remain at NTA and will be assigned to South Loop. Under this plan, the first
cohort of 9th graders would attend the NTA high school beginning in 2019-20. This transition is
displayed graphically in Figure 1.

South Loop previously had a pre-K program located at its Early Childhood Center, located at 1915 S Federal St. However, due to
overcrowding, South Loop had to cut its pre-K program and use the space for additional kindergarten classrooms.

In addition to the gradual transition of students shown above, the Plan also contains a
guarantee that every current NTA student, regardless of where they live, will have a guaranteed spot in
the new high school. CPS has also set aside $3.5 million to support the transition of NTA students
through graduation and including the creation of a joint Culture and Climate Team comprised of staff,
parents, and student representatives from NTA and South Loop. In addition, part of this funding is
earmarked for the implementation of restorative practices and professional development for South
Loop and NTA staff.
The focus of this report is to describe the potential impacts, both positive and negative, that
this proposal may have on various stakeholders in the Near South community. This work will allow CPS
to fully understand the concerns and expectations of stakeholders, likely challenges, and potential
solutions. After a request for proposal and vendor selection process, CPS contracted with Westat to
conduct this study. The revised Transition Plan was released on December 1, 2017, and Westat was
contracted to begin work soon after, on December 11th, concluding February 23, 2018. Westat utilized
a multi-method approach to this task, combining information from focus groups, interviews, a

CPS Equity Report

2

 document review (including the CPS Transition Plan), and an analysis of CPS enrollment data 5 (see
Appendix B for the full Methodology). Interviews were conducted with CPS leaders, elected officials
and community stakeholders identified by CPS and community groups. Focus groups were conducted
with parents and educators from both South Loop and NTA. Additional focus groups were conducted
with parents of students of other elementary schools which are in the proposed boundary of the new
high school. For the purpose of this report, all those interviewed or participating in a focus group will
be referred to as “participants,” with the understanding that their input may not necessarily reflect the
community at-large. Any references to input from parents and educators within this report reflect
focus group participation.
The report continues with the Findings chapter that contains information on the historical
background and context for the proposal, followed by the results organized around the following
equity indicators: (1) Family and Community Engagement, (2) School Climate, (3) Culturally Relevant
Leadership Practices, (4) Student-Centered Learning, (5) Diverse Staff of Excellent Educators, (6)
Equitable Student Access, and (7) Fiscal Equity. Next is the Conclusion, which includes detailed
recommendations. The appendices follow: Appendix A contains the full Transition Plan from CPS,
Appendix B is the methodology, while Appendix C contains information on the equity indicators.

Westat conducted seven one-on-one interviews and eight focus groups of parents and educators representing affected schools and
communities. Interviews were conducted with the following: Three CPS school and district leaders, one elected official, two community
representatives, and one community organizer. Focus groups included:
•
South Loop Parents (two focus groups with a total of 24 participants)
•
National Teachers Academy Parents (two focus groups with a total of 32 participants)
•
South Loop Educators (one focus group with 13 participants)
•
National Teachers Academy Educators (one focus group with 15 participants)
•
Outlying Boundary Parents (two focus groups representing Chinatown, Drake, Healy, Haines, and Bronzeville, with a total of 15
participants)

 FINDINGS
One of the topics which resonated with the parent groups and stakeholders was the historical
context around past school boundary issues. Community stakeholders repeatedly referenced painful
past boundary decisions that segregated schools by race and income. In 2005, CPS redrew the
boundary lines which created a clear demarcation of between NTA and South Loop. Students south of
18th street went to NTA (then a low-performing school) and students north of that were zoned to
South Loop (a high-performing school). This boundary resulted in lower-income, primarily African
American residents being zoned to a low-performing school, while more affluent residents were zoned
to a high-performing school. NTA parents feel that this boundary decision was made specifically “to
exclude poor African American students and families from a

high-quality school [i.e., South Loop]” and was seen as an
example of how CPS historically has segregated schools.
Today, only 33 percent of South Loop neighborhood

students are eligible for Free and Reduced Price Lunches (FRPL) compared to 86 percent of the
neighborhood students at NTA. A comparison of the demographics of the students of the two schools
and the projected demographics of the combined school are provided in Table 1.

Note: NA = not applicable. ‘—‘ = cell size too small to report. RGC students grade K-5 all attend NTA and students grade 6-8 all attend
South Loop. Economically disadvantaged refers to students who are eligible to receive Free or Reduced Price Lunch (FRPL). The projection
was created by extrapolating the demographics from NTA in 2017-18, and assuming that all K-3 students would attend South Loop, and
that 50% of grades 4-8 would attend South Loop (selected randomly).

In fact, because the NTA (neighborhood and RGC) population is 78 percent African American, it
is less “diverse” than South Loop. Looking at the diversity index (the probability of having two students

 who are from different racial categories), South Loop is 72 percent, while for NTA that probability is 38
percent. For the combined school, the diversity index is projected to be 62 percent.
Building on this historical context, participants expressed their frustration that

ENGAGEMENT

CPS leadership had not effectively communicated with the communities throughout
the decision-making process of this proposal. CPS has attempted to address this
perception by conducting “community meetings, more than 25 small group meetings

with various stakeholders, and collecting over 900 emails from parents and community members” (CPS
Draft Transition Plan). From this input, CPS made modifications to the draft Plan to address community
concerns; however, negative perceptions of lack of communication persist. One interviewed
participant explained that CPS leadership might not be “getting equally balanced voice, and the result
is [CPS] coming up with solutions people will continue to reject until there is open and transparent
access to the decision-making process.” NTA participants were the most vocal in their frustration with
the CPS decision-making process, with one parent saying, “I do not believe CPS will use any of this
information as I intend.”
All participants agreed that the strongest recommendation was the need for CPS to
authentically listen to all constituent voices. NTA parent participants emphasized the need for
transparency in the decision-making process and “over-communication” from CPS. CPS has been
transparent with operational aspects of the proposal, such as transportation, timeline, and transition
support. Programmatic strategies, such as how the two schools will develop a new identity and
staffing, would be developed with community input during the 2018-19 school year. However, it is
precisely this lack of programmatic details that concerns parents the most.
All interview and focus group participants agreed that the current high school environment is
not conducive to family and community engagement. At this time, only 3 percent of students attend
one of the designated neighborhood high schools. All other students disperse throughout the city to
117 other schools, preventing the possibility of building a sense of community around school events
such as sports, fine arts productions, and other student performances. The Transition Plan describes a
comprehensive system of student supports to ensure that all students will experience a smooth
CPS Equity Report

 transition from one school to the other if the proposal is approved, which include supports for diverse
learners, English learners, students in temporary living situations, and students’ social and emotional
needs. These comprehensive systems of student supports should also be provided during the entire
phase-in plan and extend to both the new high school and existing high schools in the area.
Participants agreed that having a safe and successful high school in the community would boost
community engagement. Participants spoke emotionally on the topic of the stress and difficulty with
the existing selective high school/lottery process and the break-up of the community when students
disperse to far-flung high schools throughout the city. Focus group participants from the outlying
communities agreed that having all the schools feed into a single safe high school would strengthen
their communities. They shared excitement about having the opportunity to actively participate in high
school activities and school/parent groups.
According to the CPS Transition Plan, funding will be designated to address

school climate concerns. The plan creates a Culture and Climate advisory group made
up of administrators, faculty/staff, parents, and students from both affected schools.
This team will develop a shared vision, identify programming/curriculum needed to

fully support all students, develop staff development, and organize
community events to encourage the merging of the two communities.
That said, the potential integration of two successful schools with

dynamically different school cultures still poses a significant challenge.
Participants from both NTA and South Loop boast a strong sense of community. They spoke of the
“South Loop Way” and the “NTA Way” and participants indicated that both communities tie the
success of the school directly to their school’s culture.
South Loop participants indicated that the South Loop community directly ties a successful
school environment to rigorous, accelerated academic standards and achievement. As a result, South
Loop participants strongly supported their school’s leadership, because of their “strong commitment to
a high-quality education.” They also directly correlated high academic standards to the growth and
development of their neighborhood. South Loop focus group consensus was that when a
CPS Equity Report

 neighborhood boasts an academically strong school, people will want to stay in the community. South
Loop parents were also excited that the merging of the two schools would allow their children to learn
about and experience alternative educational models (e.g., restorative justice, holistic learning, etc.).
Participants from the NTA community directly tied a successful school environment to student
wellness, with a focus on the “whole child” and a culturally relevant curriculum. They emphasized that
the NTA culture teaches students to advocate for themselves, developing “strong Black leaders of the
community.” NTA participants believed their children “were well” due to strong, committed school
leaders and teachers. They shared stories of the principal greeting each child by name at the start of
each day, and one parent emphasized that the NTA school leadership maintains a consistent “message
to the children of safety and acceptance.”
Participants from both NTA and South Loop strongly believe in their schools, their students, and
their existing school cultures. CPS conducts an annual survey to assess perceptions of school culture
across 5 domains. The 2017 survey results show that both schools are considered “strong” in
“ambitious instruction” according to students and teachers. South Loop is also rated as “strong” or
“very strong” in the other four domains, whereas NTA is “neutral” in the other areas (see Figure 2).

 Discipline and attendance are another aspect of school culture. Looking at the data for both
schools, discipline can be described by the number of
incidents occurring during a given school year, as well as

Figure 3: Number of disciplinary
incidents per 100 students in 2016-17

Figure 3 shows the number of incidents per 100 students

in the 2016-17 school year, with NTA having statistically
significantly more disciplinary incidents than South Loop.
Similarly, 22 percent of NTA students were involved in at
least one disciplinary incident, compared to 3 percent of
South Loop students. However, the severity of the
disciplinary incidents should also be taken into account.
To better understand disciplinary incidents, we created an
index that included severity. The index was calculated as
the number of incidents multiplied by the severity of

those incidents (from a scale of 1 to 6). 6 Looking at this index, we found that—for the 152 NTA
students involved in an incident—the average severity index was 2.4. For the 20 South Loop students
involved in an incident, this score was statistically significantly higher—3.5. That is, while NTA had
more students involved in more incidents, South Loop had fewer incidents but of higher severity.
Westat also examined the number of in- and out-of-school suspensions over time in both
schools (see Figure 4 below). Here we can see that the proportion of out-of-school suspensions have
been declining for both schools, with NTA coming down from a peak in 2012-13. NTA also exhibits a
dramatic decrease in the number of in-school suspensions since 2015-16.

AREA:

on transition support. One such position will be a transition coordinator assigned
during SY 2018-19 and maintained at least through 2019-20. This coordinator would
act as a point of contact for transitioning students and families, directing them to

support and resources and would work with school principals to assist in programming and other
supports identified by the Culture and Climate Team. Both NTA and South Loop parent and educator
participants understood that the changes in school leadership and staffing would effectively change
the individual missions of the schools (i.e., South Loop’s academic rigor and NTA’s holistic approach).

CPS Equity Report

 Both NTA and South Loop participants were also concerned about the loss of familiar leaders if
the transition takes place. With each school having a very clearly distinct philosophy of education,
parents worried that their children would lose the very leadership philosophies that made their
individual schools successful. A CPS leadership interview participant acknowledged these differences
in school culture saying, “The schools have so much to share with each other. South Loop has a very
strong academic focus while NTA has done an amazing job of creating a culture and core values around
motivating students and bringing a sense of community.” However, it is these strengths that focus
group participants believed might be lost by combining the schools. While the South Loop participants
felt that the proposal would have some positive impacts, NTA participants felt the implementation of
the current CPS proposal would have lasting and severe negative impacts on both their children and
their community.
Of greatest concern, across both communities’ participant groups, was the concept of
“integration” which they perceived could have negative consequences.
South Loop parents expressed concern that the transition had the
potential to seriously disrupt student learning. NTA educator and

parent participants agreed, indicating that rather than an “integration”
of schools, the implementation of this proposal would result in unbalanced impacts, where one
community wins and the other loses. An outer-boundary parent expressed a similar sentiment by
saying, “Just because there’s a mixture of people does not mean good things will happen.” One South
Loop educator emphasized the need for CPS to address underlying anger, which has been building
between the communities. Some participants, though, believed that if done correctly, long-term
benefits of having a high-quality, diverse school would be great, making the school a model for others
to follow. This work would fall under the auspices of the proposed Culture and Climate Team, which
would be tasked with addressing problematic issues surrounding the concepts of integration and
merging of the two schools.

 It is important to note that the demographics of the two schools are very different, as noted
earlier in Table 1, with NTA serving a more disadvantaged population. However, even after controlling
for poverty, demographics, and other factors, 7 South Loop students still scored significantly higher on
spring 2017 MAP reading and mathematics assessments (p=<.0001) than their NTA counterparts.
Another way to consider achievement is to examine year to year growth. In fact, both NTA and
South Loop are categorized as having “above average” 8 growth by CPS. And while South Loop students
scored significantly higher on math and reading in the spring of 2017, when we examine year to year
growth, there are no statistically significant differences (see Figures 8 and 9).

While the data from South Loop and NTA does not allow us to predict the future achievement
should the schools be merged, it is apparent the South Loop students currently realize high levels of
achievement, with economically disadvantaged and African American students scoring significantly
higher than their peers at NTA.
NTA educator and parent participants expressed concern about the large size of the new
elementary school, feeling that the size would make it difficult to meet the needs of former NTA
students accustomed to a small school environment with individualized attention. They firmly believed
their primarily high-needs African American students thrive in smaller schools with individualized and
differentiated instruction allowing them to succeed academically. South Loop parents and educators,
while acknowledging the strain on NTA constituents, were generally positive when identifying impacts
of the school merger. The South Loop educators were very excited about the possibility of working
with a more diverse population while South Loop parents believed that it was “good to create a larger,
more diverse community.”

and ethnic makeup of each school’s teacher cadre. Parent participants from both
South Loop and NTA expressed deep admiration and appreciation for the teachers,
administrators and staff of each school. NTA parents directly tied the dedication of the

faculty and staff to the academic, social, and emotional well-being of their children. However, there
was great uncertainty regarding the process of selecting faculty, staff, and administrators for the
proposed new school. South Loop educators were under the impression that while NTA teachers and
staff would need to re-apply for their positions, South Loop teachers and staff would not. The South
Loop educators felt “caught in the middle” and expressed a willingness to address concerns of NTA
parents and community members. The Transition Plan acknowledges the need for purposeful staffing
of the new school with high-quality administrators and teachers trained in equity issues, holistic
instructional methodologies, and transition/change dynamics. The plan designates funding be used for
purposeful professional development in each of these areas. However, NTA parents and educators
worry that the teachers and staff at the new school would not be equipped to effectively handle the
needs of the NTA population of students, but would, rather, expect the NTA students to transition back
to a traditional school setting (i.e., not focused on a “whole child,” restorative justice approach) which
would not be conducive to their well-being or academic success.
Elementary School
EQUITY
AREA:
ACCESS

Successful schools strongly believe and ensure that all students should engage
in equitable student access daily with no hesitation to provide interactive, engaging,
challenging, reflective, high-quality instruction using a variety of strategies that

support all stages of student academic progress. The impression across all participant groups was that
a successful (i.e., 1+ rating) school was being sacrificed for the promise of a high school. Consistently,
participants expressed reservation regarding the proposed conversion, with one stating, “If they can
close NTA, they could close our school.” CPS leadership acknowledged these concerns and addressed
them by positing that it is rather a merging of two 1+ schools and emphasized that the merger of the
two schools meets all CPS guidelines, including that students not be moved to a lower-performing
CPS Equity Report

15

 school (see Transition Plan in Appendix A). NTA parent and educator participants focused on the term
“equitable” and its inherent definition of “criteria applied on a case-by-case basis to meet individual
needs,” pointing out that this was at the core of the “NTA Way” and would be lost under the proposal.
NTA parent participants assumed that the youngest grades (e.g., Pre-K to 2nd grade) would be
assigned to the original South Loop building (Note: This has not yet been determined by CPS). Working
with that assumption, they believed that since the transition begins with the youngest grades, their
children would have to leave a great facility only to be placed in the old South Loop building, which was
perceived to be “rundown” and “outdated.” It was the understanding of the South Loop parent and
educator participants that the new building would be built even if the current CPS proposal was not
adopted. The South Loop participants were excited about the possible return of the full RGC (grades
K–5 currently reside at NTA), and improved library, nurse’s station, and other school support systems.
Proposed High School
All interviewees and focus groups agreed that having
a neighborhood high school is extremely valuable and agreed
that being able to spare their children from the stressful high
school selection process was a significant benefit. That said,
participants consistently expressed concern that existing high
schools were being neglected in favor of establishing a new
high school for a wealthier neighborhood. Focus group
participants expressed reluctance to send their children to
the existing high schools in the current boundary, and agreed
that many families move away from the neighborhood to the
suburbs or to be within the boundary of a “good” CPS high
school.
The proposed high school would have a traditional
neighborhood school boundary with the addition of a preference boundary that will provide families
living just outside the neighborhood boundary with first access to any available seats after students in
the neighborhood boundary enroll. The proposed neighborhood boundary incorporates the following
CPS Equity Report

16

 elementary school boundaries – Drake, Haines, Healy, NTA, South Loop, and Ward. The proposed
preference boundary incorporates the following elementary school boundaries – Armour, Holden and
Pershing.
While students are currently zoned to Phillips or Tilden (both level 2 schools) only 55 out of
2,032 attended in 2017-18. The remaining students attend 117 other high schools, travelling an
average of 3.8 miles to school each way (ranging from 0.1 to 13.5 miles). If NTA is converted into a high
school, this travel distance would be reduced by nearly two-thirds: to 1.3 miles. Currently, Asian
students travel the farthest distance (4.1 miles), while White students travel the least distance (2.9
miles). Looking at the demographics of high school attendance by school quality, Table 3 shows us that
60 percent of all current high school students who live within the proposed boundary attend a level 1+
high school, and travel nearly 4 miles each way to do so. Moreover, the proportion of economically
disadvantaged and minority youth attending a 1+ high school is substantially lower than the
proportions attending lower ranked high schools.

While participating parents from outlying boundaries expressed that they did not want to see a
1+ school closed in order to make room for a high school, they were excited about the prospect of
having a state-of-the-art high school nearby. They did, however, express great concern that because
the NTA and South Loop students would have automatic entry into the high school, there would not be
enough space and no priority status for their own students. Our analysis of CPS data indicates capacity
of the proposed high school would be between 7 percent and 88 percent, under a varied set of
assumptions, as illustrated in Table 4.

neighborhood boundary.

Under the most conservative estimates of a capacity where the school holds 1,000 students and

is rated as 1+, our analysis predicts that it will be at 88 percent of maximum capacity, after enrolling
students from within the neighborhood and preference boundaries, leaving 220 available slots for the
rest of the city.
Participants within each of the constituent groups identified three issues
EQUITY
AREA: FISCAL

regarding fiscal investment and resource allocation. First, groups expressed concern
over setting a precedent of closing a successful, high-rated neighborhood school. NTA
parents and educators were distressed that all the time, effort and resources which

had been put into making NTA a 1+ rated school would be lost. Second, participants questioned how
resources would be provided to a new school when parents feel that resources have not been available
to improve existing high schools. The CPS Transition Plan allocates $3.5 million to fund transition and
support mechanisms for students through graduation. Parent participants from both schools agreed
that the allotted $3.5 million set aside for the school transition probably would not be enough to cover
everything required for transition support services for a new elementary school. Upon reading a
summary of the transition plan at the focus group (see Appendix A), participants were confused about
the allocation of the funding, many thinking that the funding would also be used for establishing the
new high school. The Transition Plan, however, states:
“CPS has set aside approximately $3.5 million to support the transition 9 of current NTA
students until they graduate. These funds will go toward supports and resources for
students and families in order to ensure a smooth transition into one, unified school
community.”

No mention is made in the transition plan of using the funding to establish the new high school.

 CONCLUSION
Challenges
A myriad of concerns and challenges have arisen from the CPS proposal. The greatest challenge
is ensuring that NTA students continue to receive the equitable services, culturally responsive teaching,
and social-emotional support that NTA staff successfully provide. Currently, extreme mistrust of the
CPS leadership is very high—NTA stakeholders perceive that
their children are being displaced for the convenience of
more wealthy stakeholders. In fact, the South Loop
participants acknowledged that the burden of this proposal

The greatest challenge is ensuring that the

would be shouldered largely by the NTA community, with
NTA students being the ones transitioned rather than the South Loop students. Projecting the
enrollment of the high school, which would serve both communities, Table 5 illustrates the similarities
and differences between the population that currently attends NTA and the projected population that
would attend NTA should it be converted into a high school.

We found that while the proposed high school is projected to be more racially diverse than the
existing NTA elementary school population (with a diversity index of 69 percent compared to 38
percent), it would serve statistically significantly fewer African American students and more Hispanic
and Asian students because the high school would draw students from neighboring communities.

 CPS leadership acknowledged that past actions and failed promises had created an
environment that would make the implementation of the proposal particularly challenging. They also
emphasized that because “Chicago is so segregated, if we don’t start making hard decisions like this
and having tough conversations, then we’re going to lose the great opportunity we have to create truly
more diverse and successful schools.” However, a community member interviewed acknowledged,
“Racial diversity is an important factor, but when you see it have a negative impact on students of
color and a disruption to student lives, the benefits of diversity are not realized.”
Inherent in the perceptions of this proposal is the idea of having one “welcoming school” and
one “closing school” with one school losing its identity and existence. This was the overwhelming
understanding of the focus group participants. One parent stated, “Integration will be difficult because
the process has created bitterness on many levels and all sides.” The perception of involuntary
integration, is that “NTA students will always be ‘those kids.’” The Transition Plan, in some ways
reinforces this perception by referring to the new school as “South Loop.” However, the plan does
acknowledge inherent challenges and attempts to be proactive in addressing challenges through the
promised allocation of funding, resources and support. In the event that identified challenges are
overcome, there is great potential to develop a diverse, high-quality school environment and
community that is able to address the holistic needs of all the attending students.
CPS leaders and community stakeholders interviewed also acknowledged the risks as well as
the potential benefits inherent in such a school merger. Having a high-quality, neighborhood high
school for the community to coalesce around was the most advantageous benefit identified by all
participants. South Loop educator participants identified another benefit as being able to learn from
NTA educators how to implement more high-quality differentiated and holistic approaches to learning
and supporting students. When addressing the risk inherent in the plan, one of those interviewed
stated, “Whenever you come up with a proposal like this, it’s met with a lot of resistance for a lot of
different reasons. When you integrate homogenous communities, that’s hard. People have their own
affinities and histories tied to their community schools.” One participant from the outlying boundary
focus group urged the two communities to come together to “define the climate and culture of the
new school,” adding that “too much screaming, with each person with their own vested interests
CPS Equity Report

20

 blocks out the needs of others.” One community stakeholder interviewed agreed, saying, “To have
successful integration requires the valuing of both communities.” All participants agreed that for the
plan to have a chance of success, both school identities would need to be transformed into a new
identity that develops and nurtures all students. To make this happen, not only would surface-level
changes be required (e.g., name changed, new mission/vision, new mascot, uniforms etc.) but deeper
changes would also be needed (e.g., no more “NTA Way” or “South Loop Way” but rather a “New
School Way”). Participants agreed that the new school would need a mix of educators from the two
existing schools as well as familiar administrators from both schools. In fact, NTA participants
emphatically recommended that educators, support staff, and administrators from NTA be
transitioned to the proposed new school in order to continue supporting the NTA students.
Recommendations
Equity is a process and must be a shared goal by all parties involved. There is an acute
awareness that combining schools is also combining communities, and to that end, CPS understands
the need to “continue to identify issues of concern” as demonstrated by requesting this study. The
transition plan captures critical elements that must be addressed; however, we are still at beginning
stages with much to be articulated and agreed upon. An open question that remains is the agreed
upon “metrics of success and timeline” to assure that equity across a broad array of practices and
outcomes is realized.
The recommendations that follow support the transition plan, stakeholder feedback, and data
analyses organized by our key equity indicators.
Concerns and Recommendations from Interview and Focus Group Participants
The following concerns and recommendations in Table 6 were identified by the participants in
the interviews and focus groups. It is important to note that many of these concerns and
recommendations have already been addressed in the Transition Plan that CPS provided. These
concerns and recommendations are arranged within the identified equity indicators used throughout
this report (see Table 6).

Recommendations from Westat
Family and Community Engagement (Create a shared vision that honors and values all voices)
•

The Transition Plan outlines a process to create a joint Culture and Climate Team that includes a
cadre of school leaders, teachers, staff, parents, and students from both elementary schools
during the 2018-19 school year to support NTA and South Loop in creating a shared vision for
the future. Due to the large number of active stakeholders, we suggest using interactive and
structured protocols like, but not limited to, Open Space Technology, Problems of Practice,
learning circles, customized gallery walks with highly skilled and trained facilitators to ensure all
voices are heard and valued.

•

In addition to the critical duties and responsibilities outlined in the Transition Plan for the
Principal Transition Coordinator (PTC), we suggest that the PTC collaborate with the school
principals to identify a number of ways in which parents and community stakeholders can
actively participate in creating this shared vision (e.g., establish multiple advisory committees
with specific areas of focus; and identify key priorities, goals, actions steps, and performance
measures to guide the work and track interim progress). The ideas, recommendations, and
suggestions will be shared and/or presented to the Culture and Climate Team.

CPS Equity Report

26

 •

Though the Transition Plan indicates that there is a “desire to retain all of the exceptional
teachers and staff” from both school communities and indicates that this is a priority, we
strongly recommend that CPS communicates their staffing plan clearly explaining how
administrators and staff will be selected for the new school. This will reassure the NTA
community that NTA staff will play an integral role in the merging of the two school
communities if the current proposal receives board approval.

Culturally Relevant Leadership Practices (Provide sustained professional learning focused on cultural
responsiveness)
Funds will support professional development activities for staff, students, parents, and
community members to engage in courageous conversions related to culture, class, and race. These
activities will be invaluable to support the merging of the school communities. We also recommend the
following additional culturally relevant leadership practices:
•

Adopt and outline the ways in which the school leaders, teachers, and the entire faculty and
staff will practice and activate culturally relevant leadership to ensure that all students are
valued, honored, and celebrated.

•

Provide purposeful, ongoing, job-embedded, and sustained professional learning that supports
the shared vision for cultural responsiveness and culturally relevant pedagogy.

•

Provide readily available resources, tools, suggested book studies, learning modules, etc., that
support the school’s shared vision for achieving cultural responsiveness (see Appendix E for
sample resources).

School Climate (Provide safe spaces for facilitated, interactive discussions)
•

The Culture and Climate Team, as described in the Transition Plan, will include a cadre of school
leaders, teachers, staff, parent, and students from both elementary schools during the 2018-19
school year. Since the team will focus on “identifying potential professional development or
training opportunities for teachers and staff aligned with the shared vision,” we strongly
recommend providing safe spaces to convene facilitated, interactive discussions using protocols

CPS Equity Report

27

 and processes that honor the principles of adult learning for the staff early in the transition
process to collectively discuss their vision for school climate that continues to honor their vision
for maintaining a safe space every day for their students that is harmonious, welcoming, and
inclusive. These interactive and engaging sessions will take the conversations and discussions
deeper after the “get to know you” socials that students, families, and teachers will be invited
to attend.
•

We also recommend that the Culture and Climate Team conducts a study on successful school
integration using a plethora of resources including an article/book study, visit or conduct virtual
meetings with successful school integration models (e.g., Morris School District in New Jersey,
Clinton School District in Mississippi, Jefferson County Public Schools in Kentucky), and carefully
review the successful tenets for successful school integration that these models advocate. Each
of the examples listed continue to experience successes as well as challenges; therefore, having
authentic dialogue with these districts and others may provide insightful information about
successful school integration. Share your findings with CPS, the administrators, and school
board to inform the school integration plan for two school communities. 10

Student Centered Learning (Ensure differentiated, individualized, and student-centered learning)
The Transition Plan describes a comprehensive system of student supports to ensure that all
students will experience a smooth transition from one school to the other if the proposal is approved.
Although the description outlines supports for diverse learners, English learners, and support for
students in temporary living situations, and students’ social and emotional needs, we also recommend

 •

Provide support and technical assistance to school leaders and teachers on the differentiated
ways instruction can be tailored to meet students’ individual learning needs based on in-depth
data analyses.

•

Ensure that teachers have flexibility in the multiple approaches that have been successfully
employed at both schools to support student-centered learning for continued student
academic success.

Equitable Student Access (Reassure parents and students in outlying neighborhoods)
•

In the spirit of over-communicating the details outlined in the Transition Plan and in the January
8, 2018, CPS Press Release that describes the proposed neighborhood boundary and the
proposed preference boundary (see high school information in Table 6), we
recommend providing more clarity to reassure the outlying neighborhoods that their students
will have a seat at the new high school if the proposal receives board approval. Though the plan
and January 8th press release clearly describes that the new high school will serve students in
the Near South Area, we encourage an emphasis that this obviously includes students from
Chinatown, Bridgeport, North Bronzeville, and South Loop. Parents who attended the focus
group in Chinatown emphasized how appreciative they would be if student access to the new
high school include all the potential students in the outlying boundary areas.

Diverse Staff of Excellent Educators (Implement an equitable plan to retain the exemplary teachers and
staff from both schools)
•

Though the Transition plan indicates that there is a “desire to retain all of the exceptional
teachers and staff” from both school communities, we strongly recommend that CPS
communicates a clear and equitable plan for staffing the new elementary school with
administrators and teachers from both existing schools, thus ensuring a diverse staff of
excellent educators.

•

The PTC will play a supportive leadership role during the 2018-19 school year and in 2019-20.
Though this is certainly an exemplary supportive leadership model, we encourage CPS to

CPS Equity Report

29

 further explore multiple leadership models (e.g., Lead principals for the new elementary school
can implement a shared leadership approach to support the multiple schools on the campuses,
and all three principals—lead principals of the elementary school and new high school
principal—will work collaboratively for successful transition). Findings from the focus group
sessions indicated strong advocacy for maintaining leadership at both elementary school
communities.
•

Ensure that both the new elementary and high schools participate in shared decision-making
with CPS to recruit, hire, and retain a diverse cadre of excellent educators.

Fiscal Equity (Ensure transparent use of funds to support the transition)
We recognize that the Transition Plan has appropriated $3.5 million to support the transition
through a number of ways (e.g., ongoing professional development and training opportunities, a series
of meaningful and engaging events and activities for students and families in the school communities,
the creation of a purposeful Culture and Climate team, and a shuttle bus for NTA students transitioning
to the newly-merged elementary school). In an effort to clarify a host of inquiries from the focus group
participants, we recommend the following:
•

Examine the resources that support the transition plan, which includes initial details to merge
the two school communities and the ongoing professional development plan to ensure that
equitable funding is allocated to support the unique needs to ensure a successful newly-merged
elementary school and new high school.

•

Communicate using multiple sources (e.g., designated page on the CPS website; newsletters;
correspondence to both schools during both academic years, 2018-19 and 2019-20) a clear plan
for how all existing support services will either remain in the NTA community or will move to
the new school to continue to support the existing NTA students and their families.

•

Ensure transparency and provide detailed budget information to both schools so that school
leaders can clearly communicate allocations to the entire school communities to support the
transition, integration, and ongoing professional development plans.

 High School Supports
While this analysis has focused primarily on the impacts of the elementary school transition, it
is important to highlight the need for a plan for improvement of existing high schools around the Near
South and surrounding neighborhoods as well as a detailed plan describing funding, operational, and
programming efforts that will take place to make the new high school a 1+, safe school.

*3 Public For the Proposed Reassigned Boundary Change of
SC National Teachers Academy

. Introduction

Chicago Public Schools (CPS) is committed to providing every child from every community with a
high quality education that prepares them for success in college and in life. CPS students continue to
make record-breaking academic progress in every part of the city. Our vision is that all CPS schools
can build on this progress by offering high quality, rigorous instruction from talented educators that
help put Chicago students on a path to lasting success.

In May 2017, in response to community requests to strengthen educational options in the Near South
area, CPS introduced a preliminary framework to expand high quality neighborhood options from
pre-K through high school in the Near South area by expanding the boundaries of South Loop
Elementary School [South Loop] and converting National Teachers Academy (PITA) to a
neighborhood high school. This preliminary framework was designed to address key priorities in the
Near South community, including providing a continuum of high quality neighborhood school
options for all students from pre-K through high school graduation, as well as building diverse school
communities.

With a new facility under construction to relieve overcrowding at South Loop Elementary School,
CPS is proposing expanding South Loop?s boundaries south to include the entire National Teachers
Academy?s boundary. This will increase access to this new, state-of?the-art school facility and create
one of the most racially and economically diverse schools in the city. In addition, expanding South
Loop?s boundaries seeks to right a historical wrong in the Near South area by including students who
were previously excluded from South Loop. As CPS noted in a letter to Near South families earlier
this year: ?Years ago, when South Loop Elementary School was built, boundaries were drawn that
excluded and separated low-income black children from their peers. This was wrong then, and it is
wrong now, and this recommendation will right a historical wrong.?

Additionally, gradually converting NTA to a neighborhood high school seeks to increase high quality,
neighborhood high school seats in the Near South area. Current high school students in the Near
South area have very few nearby high school options. Currently, only 8 percent of high school
students in the Near South area attend their neighborhood high school and, as a result, 57 percent of
high school students in the Near South area travel more than three miles to attend high school.
Introducing a high quality, neighborhood high school option close to home will create a continuum
of high quality options for Near South students in pre-K through high school graduation.

After introducing this proposal to the Near South community in May, CPS conducted extensive
community engagement to seek further feedback on the preliminary framework. This engagement
included three community meetings, more than 25 small group meetings with various stakeholders
in the Near South and collecting over 900 e-mails from various parents and community members. As
a result of this feedback, CPS amended its proposal to better serve the community. In particular, CPS
drafted a more gradual conversion timeline for NTA students so that the vast majority of existing
NTA students could continue their academic careers at NTA as the high school expands.

 

Appendix A: CPS Proposal 32

Based on additional input from community members, CPS also adjusted its proposal so that South
Loop's boundaries will expand further south than 22?? street, to incorporate the entirety of N'l?l?t?s
current boundary and a high school boundary will be determined in coming weeks. Moving forward,
we will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that all children receive the best possible
education from pre-K through high school graduation.

As part of this process, CPS formed a Near South Community Leadership Steering Committee,
comprised of community leaders, educators and parents who will provide critical input as the
process moves forward. CPS has engaged the Steering Committee to discuss transition supports
needed to ensure success of this proposal. The Steering Committee?s recommendations have been
incorporated in the transition supports below. Should this proposal move forward, the Steering
Committee will play a vital role in helping CPS and the community as we move into the
implementation phase, including developing recommendations on plans for the new high school.

II. Summary af?iction

CPS is proposing to reassign National Teachers ?cademy's boundary and students overtime, starting
in the fall of 2019. National ?cademy is a elementary school located at 55 Cermalc
Road that currently serves T29 students. National Teachers Academy has a pre?K program as well as
a Regional Gifted Center program for students in grades South Loop Elementary School is a 
elementary school located at 1212 South Plymouth Ct. that currently serves 7?33 students. South Loop
previously had a pre-K program located at its Early Childhood Center. located at 1915 Federal St.
However, due to overcrowding issues over the past five to 10 years, South Loop had to cut its pre-K
program and use the space for additional kindergarten classrooms. South Loop also has an RGC
program currently serving students in grades 6-8.

In the fall of 2018, all students attending National Teachers Academy can remain at NTA. The pre-K
program currently at will remain at for the 2018-19 school year. In addition, there will be
no changes to the boundaries and South Loop for the 2018-19 school year.

In the fall of2019, NTA students in grades 3 and below will be transferred to South Loop Elementary
School. These students will also have the option to transfer to a different elementary school, including
their neighborhood elementary school. The RGC program for grades K-3 will re-locate to South Loop
and phase in grades over time. In addition, the pro-K program currently at NTA will relocate to South
Loop. 1n the fall of 2019, N'l?l?t students in grades 4: and above will have the option to either remain at
through elementary school and high school or transition to South Loop Elementary School.

In the fall of 2019, students living in the current NTA boundary will be zoned to South Loop
Elementary School. The re-assignment of school boundaries will occur over the following timeline:

0 Effective fall of 2019-20, for grades K-3, current NTA boundary will be zoned to South Loop.
Students living in the current boundary in grades 4-8 will remain zoned to N'l?I?l.

0 Effective fall of 2020-21, for grades K-4, current NTA boundary will be zoned to South Loop.
Students living in the current boundary in grades 5-8 will remain zoned to 

0 Effective fall of 2021-22, for grades current N'l'l'l boundary will be zoned to South Loop.
Students living in the current NTA boundary in grades 6-8 will remain zoned to NTA.

I Effective fall of 2022-23, for grades current NTA boundary will be zoned to South Loop.
Students living in the current NTA boundary in grades 7-3 will remain zoned to NTA.

 

an Effective fall of 2023-24, for grades K-T, current boundary will be zoned to South Loop.
Students living in the current NTA boundary in grade will remain zoned to NTA.
0 Effective fall of 2024-25, for grades K-8, current boundary will be zoned to South Loop.

Starting in 2019-20, NTA will simultaneously begin phasing in high school grades and phasing
out the remaining elementary school grades, eventually converting to a 9-12 neighborhood high
school serving students in Near South Area, including Chinatown, Bridgeport, North Eronaeville and
South Loop. The timeline for this conversion will he as follows:

In SY will contain students in grades 4-9

In S?i? 2020-21, NTA will contain students in grades 5-10

In S?i? 2021-22, NTA will contain students in grades 6-11

In S?i? 2022-23, NTA will contain students in grades 7-12

In SY will contain students in grades 8-12

In S?i? 2024-25 and beyond, NTA will contain students in grades 9-12

u:

The proposed re-assignment of N'l?A's boundary meets the criteria of the Chief Executive Officer?s
Guidelines for School Actions (Guidelines) because it is a proposal requested by parents or
community members via the process to request proposals outlined in the Guidelines. Specifically, we
have heard the request for this proposal from recommendations by public of?cials, parents,
community members and community groups in the Near South area in the form of petitions, e-mail
and statements at community meetings. This proposal is also consistent with the Guidelines because
the resulting space utilization after the reassignment boundary change will not exceed any affected
schools' enrollment ef?ciency range as de?ned by Space Utilization Standards. Finally, the 

 

students impacted by this proposed re?assignment boundary change are being provided the option
to enroll at South Loop Elementary School, a higher performing school, as defined by the Guidelines.

CPS has set aside approximately $3.5 million to support the transition of current NTA students until
they graduate. These funds will go toward supports and resources for students and families in order
to ensure a smooth transition into one, uni?ed school community.

The transition plan outlined below summarizes what will he provided to support the transition of
NTA and South Loop students and families into one school community. Throughout this plan, we will
be offering answers to key questions and considerations that parents and community members
raised throughout the community engagement process CPS held earlier this year. We expect to
provide additional information as transition plans are finalized in partnership with the community
and school administrations.

Ill. Community Building and Culture Integration

One of the major benefits of this proposal is the opportunity to create a more integrated school
community, not just among students but among parents and the broader community as well.
Successful integration requires time, effort and resources to unite communities around a shared,
cohesive identity. Though students from NTA would not transition to South Loop until the fall of
2019, the process to bring these two communities will start this school year, should the Board
approval this proposal. These supports may be further customized as feedback is obtained at
community meetings and a public hearing regarding this proposal. Additionally, resources may be
adjusted to meet the unique needs ofaffected students ifdeemed necessary.

0 Provide stipends for the creation of a joint Culture and Climate Team, with representation
from principals, teachers, staff, parents and students at both N'l?l?t and South Loop,
responsible for:

0 Developing a shared vision and set of values for the culture at South Loop;

Identifying any programs, curriculum, or other activities in school to achieve the
vision;

Identifying potential professional development or training opportunities for teachers
and staff, in accordance with vision;

Developing a schedule of activities, prior to the fall of 2019, to bring school
communities together;

0 Create a schedule of activities, with input from the transition committee, for students
and families to come together. Such activities could include pool parties, board game
nights, merging of existing events at each school, tour of the new elementary school
facility in S?r? 2018-19, specific events and forums for parents, mutual service project,
pen pals andfor book share, opportunities for communities to learn about each
other?s culture, etc.

0 Provide funding for activities through which and South Loop students and parents can
come together prior to fall of 2019. The schedule ofactivities will be determined with input
from the joint Culture and Climate team and may include activities such as:

Detail on proposed HS boundaries:
Overview: The proposed high school in the Near South community will have a traditional neighborhood school boundary
with the addition of a preference boundary that will provide families living just outside the neighborhood boundary with
first access to any available seats after students in the neighborhood boundary enroll.
• Proposed Neighborhood Boundary incorporates the following elementary school boundaries – Drake, Haines,
Healy, NTA, South Loop, and Ward.
• Proposed Preference Boundary incorporates the following elementary school boundaries – Armour, Holden, and
Pershing.
Boundary Descriptions:
• Neighborhood boundaries give students living in the boundary a guaranteed seat at the school. Many high
school students choose to attend schools other than their neighborhood school. Across the district,
approximately 22 percent of high school students attend their neighborhood school.
• Preference boundaries give preference to students living in the boundary over other students in the city if
additional seats are not occupied by students in the neighborhood boundary.
Current enrollment trends among students in proposed enrollment boundary:
• Currently, only three percent of current high school students in the draft enrollment boundaries for the
proposed high school attend their designated neighborhood high school.
• 69 percent of current high school students in the draft enrollment boundaries travel more than three miles to
attend high school.
Demographics and capacity information:
• There are 2,037 high school age students living in the draft boundary area (including both neighborhood and
preference boundaries).
o The demographics of current high school students living in the enrollment boundaries are 27 percent
African American, 19 percent Hispanic, 41 percent Asian, 10 percent White, 3 percent Other, and 74
percent Low Income students.
• The estimated capacity of the high school is between 1,000–1,200 students, depending upon final space
configuration if the proposal moves forward.
• 60 percent of the current high school students who live in the draft boundary area attend a selective enrollment
or level 1+ high school.
• Across the district, the highest percentage of high school students attending their neighborhood boundary high
school is 63 percent at Washington HS.

APPENDIX B: Methodology
Qualitative
Westat conducted seven one-on-one phone interviews and eight focus groups of parents and educators
representing affected schools and communities. Interview time averaged 40 minutes and were conducted
with the following:
•

CPS Leadership (3 school and district-level leaders)

•

Elected Official (1)

•

Community Representatives (2 from out-lying boundaries)

•

Community Organizer (1)

Focus group time averaged 90 minutes and included parents and educators from each of the affected
communities:
•

South Loop Parents (2 focus groups with a total of 24 participants)

•

National Teachers Academy Parents (2 focus groups with a total of 32 participants)

•

South Loop Educators (1 focus group with 13 participants)

•

National Teachers Academy Educators (1 focus group with 15 participants)

•

Outlying Boundaries Parents (2 focus groups representing Chinatown, Drake, Healy, Haines, and
Bronzeville, with a total of 15 participants)

Participants from outlying communities were parents/guardians of students (several with multiple children)
ranging from Pre-K to high school, with the majority representing elementary level students.

It has become increasingly accepted practice to utilize verbatim quotations in social
research. Literature in qualitative research methodology identifies multiple purposes for using quotations
within analytical text. Corden & Sainsbury (2006) identify 7 purposes for using quotations. They are:
•

Presenting discourse as the matter of enquiry

•

Presenting quotations as evidence

•

Presenting spoken words for explanation

•

Using quotations as illustration

•

Using quotations to deepen understanding

•

Using spoken words to enable voice

•

Using quotations to enhance readability

Sandelowski (1994) explains that “Quotes are used to support researcher claims, illustrate ideas,
illuminate experience, evoke emotion, and provoke response.” Quotations used to “illustrate emotions,” as
used in this report, were identified as words which represented not just the speaker of the words, but multiple
people within the focus groups or interview groups. These quotations are reflective of emotional impact of
the topic and secondarily served the purpose of providing authentic voice to those who participated in the
process.

Appendix B: Methodology

 Quantitative
We received student-level demographic, assessment, discipline, and attendance data from Chicago
Public Schools. All data sets were restructured, cleaned, and merged by student ID numbers. We examined
missing data and outliers, deleted duplicate entries and coded those students who moved between schools.
Altogether, there are 2 years of data (school years 2015-16 and 2016-17) for student assessment, discipline
and attendance, and 3 years of data (2017-18 included) for student demographics.
Projecting the future demographics of the combined South Loop elementary school. The projection
was created by extrapolating the demographics from NTA in 2017-18, and assuming that all K-3 students
would attend South Loop, and that 50 percent of grades 4-8 would attend South Loop (selected randomly).
Diversity Index. Simpson’s Diversity Index (Simpson, 1949) measures the probability that two
individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to the same categories. The formula used for our
race diversity calculation is as follows:
Diversity Index = 1 - ((proportion of White students)2 + (proportion of Black students)2 +
(proportion of Asian students)2 + (proportion of Hispanic student)2 + (proportion of
multi-racial students)2 )
Discipline and attendance. The number of discipline incidents per 100 students, the percentage of
students involved in at least one incident, and the severity index were examined. The severity index was
calculated as the number of incidents multiplied by the severity of the incident. The discipline data in 2016-17
were analyzed to determine if there were significant differences. A negative binomial regression was used
because the variance was greater than the mean for both the total number of incidents and total severity
score (Agresti, 2002). The attendance data in 2016-17 were analyzed to determine if there were significant
differences in the number of days absent overall and by RGC status. An independent samples t-test was used
to analyze differences in the number of days absent.
Academic performance. When comparing the academic performance of the two schools, mathematics
and reading scores were provided descriptively (Figure 1) and analyses were conducted to determine if
differences were statistically significant. Mathematics and reading scores in 2016-17 were analyzed to
determine if there were significant differences across schools overall and for each subgroup using an
independent samples t-test (Figures 2 and 3). Multiple hypothesis tests were corrected for each subject
separately using the Benjamin-Hochberg technique. In these analyses there was no matching or adjustment
for other demographic or academic characteristics. Since there are many factors that could affect student
Appendix B: Methodology

45

 academic achievement, we also looked at the difference in student MAP percentile scores across the two
schools using multiple regression analysis. The regression analyses were limited to students who had both
years (2015-16 and 2016-17) of MAP test data. Student demographic variables (gender, special education
status, disability statues, ethnicity) were included in the regression model. We also controlled for student
baseline performance (student MAP percentile scores in year 2015-16), their attendance record and their
program type (RGC vs. neighborhood). Regression analyses were carried out using spring 2016-17 MAP
reading and math percentile scores as the outcome variables.
Projected high school capacity. The percent of students attending a neighborhood school is affected by
the school quality rating. The higher the school quality rating is, the more likely neighborhood students will
attend. Based on the neighborhood enrollment statistics across the whole school district, CPS compiled a
table of expected percent of student enrollment by school quality rating (e.g. for level 1+ schools, about 43
percent of the students within the school boundary would attend). Based on the data provided by CPS, we
first calculated the expected numbers of students who would enroll in the proposed NTA high school. The
anticipated enrolment numbers would vary by school quality rating. The estimated capacity of the proposed
high school is between 1,000–1,200 students. We first calculated the percent of student enrollment based on
1,200 student capacity. The percentage was calculated by using 1,200 students as the denominator and the
anticipated student enrollment at each of the given school quality.

 Comprehensive Equity Indicators

Framing the Comprehensive Equity Indicators
Purposeful strategic planning around equity issues is a hallmark for successful schools trying to
eliminate equity gaps. Grounded in research and informed by equity studies, the seven equity indicators used
to frame this report are part of a comprehensive approach to achieving educator equity through the technical
assistance services Westat provides states, districts, and national organizations (Williams, 2015, 2016, 2017).
While the indicators used in this report are contextually broad, it is understood that as districts and schools
begin to implement strategies to eliminate equity gaps, there will be a need to work around both the broad
indicators as well as indicators specific to the local school and community context. Below are brief
descriptions of each of the seven broad equity indicators as well as a bibliography of additional resources.
Family and Community Engagement
Successful schools, more often than not, have made it a priority to engage and partner with the
families and stakeholders in the school community through strategic, deliberate, genuine, and sustaining
ways.

Appendix C: Equity Indicators

48

 School Climate & Culturally Relevant Leadership
Successful schools also embrace the importance of ensuring that all of their children are well by
honoring and deepening their understanding of the funds of knowledge that each student brings to the school
community, the multiple languages that they use, the amazing ways in which they are smart, rituals, ways of
being, and practices that they experience in their homes, community centers, civic centers, and sacred,
religious organizations. The adults in successful schools recognize that they, too, must share their own lived
experiences with their students as well to create a welcoming and inclusive school atmosphere that embraces
the uniqueness and similarities of all in the school community. Honoring these norms of daily school behaviors
and having open dialogue in safe school spaces for both the students and adults create a harmonious,
welcoming, and inclusive school community with curricula, activities, and opportunities to celebrate and learn
continuously the importance of cultural responsiveness.
Student Centered Learning
Successful schools also have a commitment to tailoring their instructional academic programming with
the student at the center of the planning, development, and delivery phases. Deeply knowing, understanding,
and appreciating the multiples ways that students learn, the importance of legitimizing their student voice in
the learning-meaning making process, and creating a variety of learning strategies in school, outdoor, and
community partnership settings to create these student-centered learning opportunities, is at the core of a
school’s faculty and staff ongoing professional development vision with the student always at the center of
the complex planning, delivery, assessing, evaluation, and reflective phases.
Diverse Staff of Excellent Educators & Equitable Student Access
Successful schools strongly believe and ensure that all students should engage in equitable student
access daily with no hesitation to provide interactive, engaging, challenging, reflective, high-quality instruction
using various learning strategies that support all stages of student academic progress. Every student is given
opportunities to excel at all stages of their academic journey through a continuously rigorous academic
program with a cadre of exceptional, diverse, excellent teachers, who are reflective, self-confident, culturally
responsive, socially and politically aware, and content experts.
Fiscal Equity
A successful school, in collaboration with its community partnerships, prioritizes the importance of
fiscal equity for its school and neighboring schools and the greater state and nation. This means that they
advocate to their school board and convey to its students, families, and communities that equitable school
Appendix C: Equity Indicators
49

 funding is vital for its students, teachers, administrators, and community as a whole. Equitable school funding
is a critical component to achieving comprehensive educator equity for all.
These seven equity indicators represent a more comprehensive approach to achieving educator equity.
Because of that, from a neutral equity lens built around these seven framing equity indicators, we have
analyzed and captured the participants’ voices thematically to better inform the Near South Proposal. This
report also frames our quantitative analysis, key findings, and recommendations around these seven framing
equity indicators.
