Finance Metrics (Attachment #3)
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the finance metrics. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the information.
During the review of the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN) Operations Overview, Board
Chair Hammock inquired regarding Prieto Clinic’s provider visits being lower than expected. Iliana Mora, Chief
Operating Officer of Ambulatory Services, responded that the clinic is experiencing a decrease in provider time,
which means they did not have enough providers. The administration is implementing recruitment plans and is
working with provider leaders to staff up at the site for full-time providers. Additionally, they are working with
the department chairs to see how to get more provider time - not just for Prieto but across the System.
Mr. Akpan provided an overview of the strategic planning discussion presentation, which included information on

Board Chair Hammock stated that, as part of the strategic plan, the Board has to have a clearer understanding
of the long-term pension liabilities; he requested that the administration makes sure that is factored in. Chair
Reiter noted that he has previously asked that the Committee have a pension discussion, so people have a
working understanding of where the pension obligation comes from, what it means, and how it factors in. Dr.
John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that he and staff will take a look at the schedule of
upcoming meetings and strategic planning topics to find the best spot to have that discussion.

Re: American College of Surgeons Hospital Participation Agreement

Respectfully requesting authority to execute a hospital participation agreement with the American
College of Surgeons for trauma data sharing and ACS benchmarking services.

This contract with ACS is necessary in order for the John H. Stroger Jr. HOSpital of Cook County to
remain a veri?ed Level 1 Trauma Center. Although the annual fee for this contract is $12,000.00, this
contract is being presented for your consideration due to requirement of an indemni?cation
clause in the accompanying business associate and data sharing agreement that would make each party
responsible for the impact of its own data breach.
