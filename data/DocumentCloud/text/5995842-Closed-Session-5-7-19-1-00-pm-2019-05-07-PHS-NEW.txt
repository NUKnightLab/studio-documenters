RE: Prop. Junior - Orangerie Aluminum Green House Structure - Cadillac Square
Winter Magic Season 2017
Detroit, Michigan

Dear Jeff.

The proposed temporary structure, scheduled for installation from November 17, 2017
until January 17, 2018, has been reviewed as presented and meets the following:

The Orangerie Aluminum Green House Structure, in accordance with MBC 2015 and
ASCE 7-05, for use in regions with 90 basic wind speed, 3-second gust, Exposure
category (urban and suburban terrain) Mean recurrence interval of 2.5 years.
Occupancy of the structures should not occur if measurable snow on the structures occur.

Temporary structure anchoring points shall be reviewed on a daily basis and reset as
needed during the installation period.

Design is in compliance with MBC 2015? Chapter 16

Please do not hesitate to call if there are questions on this review.

Sincerely,

my:

Michael J. Rybicki, P.E. (#45663)

Structural Certification Letter
Junior-T Orangerie Greenhouse
Manufactured by Janssens AluSystems in Belgium

Hollingsworth Pack has performed a structural analysis of the Junior-T Model Orangerie Greenhouse
to determine compliance with the International Building Code, which has been adopted by State
and Local governments across all U.S. States and Territories. The Junior-T Model Orangerie Is a
pre?fabricated aluminum greenhouse covered with 4mm thick tempered glass panels. A photograph
of the greenhouse can be found in the appendix of this letter.

Based upon our analysis, we have concluded that the greenhouse as currently Installed by Exaco
Trading Co. is adequate to support the following loads per the 2015 International Building Code:

Wind Load: 120 MPH (3-second gusts)
Snow Load: 35 PSF (ground~snow load)
Roof Live Load: 20 PSF

Our structural analysis and conclusions assume that the greenhouse is installed with a minimum
8"x16? tall concrete beam or solld-grouted masonry foundation continuous below the perimeter of
the greenhouse walls. The greenhouse should be anchored to the foundatlon with (8) mounting
brackets attached to the greenhouse frame, as specified in the Junior-T Mounting
Instructions" document to resist overturning and uplift forces.

If you have any questions regarding the matters addressed, or if additional Information is required,
please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate the opportunlty to be of service.

The 080 AcousticDesignTM 2 is a
surface mounted low impedance. 12" two-
way loudspeaker system. ideally suited for a
wide variety of foreground and background
sound reinforcement applications.

AcousticDesignTM series offers integrators a
premium quality installed sound solution
where performance, coverage. and
aesthetics are paramount. Combined with
unprecedented ease-of?installation and high
weather resistance, the AcousticDesignTM
series provides integrators a versatile and
confident install solution.

The 2 features a high quality 12"
weather treated paper cone woofer on a
2.5" voice coil. A carefully selected 1" exit.
1.4" compression driver perfectly matches
the sensitivity and performance of the
woofer for outstanding full-range
reproduction.

Consistent and even 75" axisymmetric
(conical) coverage is achieved through
(Directivity Matched Transition). a
080 innovation which matches the
directivity patterns of the woofer and the
high-frequency waveguide at the crossover
point. The result is a coherent transition
between transducers and improved off-axis
response.

With rugged ABS enclosures. sealed input
panel covers, and powder-coated aluminum
grilles for weather resistance. the
AcousticDesignT'V' surface mounted series
exceed IE060529 lP-54 ratings for dust and
splash resistance.

Installers will appreciate the award-winning
X-MountTM system included with each full-
range AcousticDesignTM model. This
ingenious mounting solution achieves
unprecedented ease-of?installation in
horizontal. vertical, wall, or ceiling
deployments. Knurled surfaces at the pivot
planes ensure the load will not drift or sag
over time. Articulation marks allow
preconfiguration of the X-MountTM while on
the ground with no special tools required.
Once secure, the loudspeaker installs in
seconds. allowing the installer to work safer.
smarter. and faster with repeatable results.

The 2 also includes M1 0 fittings for
optional yoke mount (YMS12) or shoulder
eybolt (M10 Kit?C) accessories for
installation versatility.

To further enhance performance and speed
of install with optimum result. advanced
voicing filter sets using 080 Intrinsic
CorrectionTM techniques are obtainable
using Q-Sys networked audio processing
platforms. including CXD amplifiers for a
complete 080 systems solution.

The AcousticDesignTM series feature a
stylish appearance free of obtrusive logo
adornments for aesthetically sensitive
installations. AcousticDesignTM surface
loudspeakers are available in 080 standard
black (RAL 9011) or white (HAL 9010) and
may be painted to match any decor.
