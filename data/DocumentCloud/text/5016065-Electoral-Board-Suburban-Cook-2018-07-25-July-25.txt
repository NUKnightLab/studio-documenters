A RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE REDUCTION OF AIR AND WATER POLLUTION
STANDARDS IN WISCONSIN FOR THE PROPOSED FOXCONN DEVELOPMENT
WHEREAS, Foxconn Technology Group (“Foxconn”) is a manufacturer of computer, communication and
electronics; and
WHEREAS, Foxconn is constructing a fabrication plant in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin to manufacture
LCD glass panels. Mount Pleasant is in Racine County, Wisconsin; and
WHEREAS, the proposed plant is sited at the headwaters of the Des Plaines River and is located
approximately 50 miles from the border of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County shares the Des Plaines Watershed Region, and our water and air resources are
all interconnected; and
WHEREAS, the State of Wisconsin has passed legislation that waives environmental regulations for the
Foxconn plant; and
WHEREAS, the legislation allows Foxconn to fill 26 acres of wetlands with dredged materials without an
Environmental Impact Study or input from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and
WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency exempted Racine County, Wisconsin
from air quality requirements for ozone, allowing Foxconn to avoid having to install stringent pollution
control equipment; and
WHEREAS, the Foxconn plant will divert approximately 7 million gallons of water from Lake Michigan
a day; and
WHEREAS, the greatest natural resource Cook County has is Lake Michigan and the proposed plant will
adversely affect that resources; and
WHEREAS, there has been no stormwater management plan for the proposed plant, even though the plant
will encompass thousands of acres of farmland; and

 WHEREAS, the Des Plaines River has had significant flooding and removing permeable land at the
headwaters of the River will likely increase the downstream flood risk; and
WHEREAS, without a proper study of all potential environmental impacts of the plant, it is unknown if
there will be adverse effects to the environment and population of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County call on the
State of Wisconsin and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to require the Foxconn
Development to comply with all applicable environmental regulations in the construction and operation of
its proposed plant at Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges the State of
Wisconsin and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to uniformly apply and enforce all
applicable regulations and laws as written without any exemptions, waivers or variances to ensure negative
impacts are not imposed on the residents of downstream Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County supports the Illinois
Attorney General, Illinois General Assembly and Illinois agencies in taking whatever actions possible to
protect Cook County and the State of Illinois against the loss of water resources, potential flooding, and
other ecological impacts from this development; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution shall be provided to the Governor of
Wisconsin, the Director of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Governor of Illinois, the
Illinois Attorney General, the Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of the
United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Director of Region 5 of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency.

WHEREAS, the County’s intergovernmental relations staff and hired lobbyists are actively monitoring the
legislation that effects Cook County’s services and operations; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners wishes to be updated on the status of certain bills
pending before the Illinois General Assembly and the United States Congress so that it may take positions

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
