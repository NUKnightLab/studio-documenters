 Medicare
Advantage

 

 

l< CountyCare
PLAN

 

Medicare 101
•

Traditional Medicare (Also known as Original Medicare)
– Original Fee-for-Service government program with no specified network, no care
management, no supplemental benefits. Part D for prescription drugs is purchased
separately.

•

Medicare Supplement
– Optional private insurance purchased in conjunction with “traditional” Medicare to cover
benefits/costs not covered by the government program.
– Typically has a premium of $75+ per month, which is often considered too costly for low
income beneficiaries. Part D is purchased separately.

•

Medicare Advantage
– Private insurance alternative to traditional Medicare; Offered by private companies that
have a contract with The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)

– Covers CMS-defined benefits plus supplemental benefits that go beyond Medicare
– Typically includes care management, disease management, and other programs aimed at
keeping people healthy

– Every year thousands of CountyCare members “graduate”
into Medicare

currently being served

Advantage expands

 Financial Assumptions
• A strategy evaluation 5 year pro forma was developed
after the initial Sr. Management Meeting on 07/27/18
in which Board members also were invited to attend.

• Medicare requires investment in upfront resources to
ensure compliance with all CMS requirements.
• Estimated break-even membership is 5,375.
• At 10,000 lives, we expect a net surplus of greater
than $7 million annually.
21

 Financial Assumptions
• First year membership enrollment target is 1,250.
• Plan is expected to realize additional financial benefit
to Cook County Health from utilization occurring at
Cook County Health facilities.
• The pro forma assumes similar in-house utilization
assumptions as is being achieved within CountyCare.
• Medicare provider network is a much smaller subset
of the current Medicaid network.

 Medicare.gov Star Rating
•

Overall Star Rating gives an overall rating of the plan’s quality and performance

•

Five Key Areas
– Staying healthy: screening tests and vaccines: Whether members received
various screening tests, vaccines, and other check-ups to help them stay healthy.
– Managing chronic (long-term) conditions: How often members with certain
conditions got recommended tests and treatments to help manage their
conditions.
– Member experience with the health plan: Member ratings of the plan.
– Member complaints and changes in the health plan’s performance: How often
members had problems with the plan. Includes how much the plan’s
performance improved (if at all) over time.
– Health plan customer service: How well the plan handles member calls and
questions

•

Pharmacy (Part D) Stars are also Critical

26

 Keys to Success
• Getting membership to scale quickly
• Plan is expected to realize additional financial benefit to Cook
County Health from utilization occurring at Cook County
Health facilities

• The pro forma assumes similar in-house utilization
assumptions as achieved within CountyCare
• Medicare provider network is a much smaller subset of the
current Medicaid network

27

 Keys to Success
• Stars
– Significant implications to revenue and growth
– Work in year one has significant impact on Initial Star rating, which is
published in 2022
– Affected by multiple parts of the organization
• Risk Adjustment
– Significant implications to revenue; can be used as a good tool for
medical management
