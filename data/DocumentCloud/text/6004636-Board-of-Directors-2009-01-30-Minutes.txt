1 The negative cash balance in the general fund for the Cook County Health 8: Hospitals System is
primarily attributable to a steep decline in the collection of patient fees over the past four ?scal years in
the cumulative amount of $238.9 million {Please see attached schedule Exhibit The 
has also experienced a very signi?cant decline in the IGT reimbursement from $259.1 million in FY
2005 to $132.9 million in FY 2003. representing a decrease of $126.2 million 

2 The County maintains a consolidated-working cash fund for corporate. public safety. health and
election fund purposes. The ?nancial resources needed to establish the working cash fund were
obtained from the issuance of long-term bonds. The primary purpose of the working cash fund is to
provide ?nancing for operations pending the receipt of property tax revenue from the Cook County
Treasurer's Of?ce. In accordance with a Cook County Board resolution, funds borrowed from the
working cash fund are required to be repaid during the ?scal year by November 30th.

3 In FY 2002. Cook County issued $101 million in General Obligation Bonds to meet the Self-Insurance
?nancial obligations for verdicts. settlement claims. worker's compensation claims. and litigation related
expenses. In FY 2004. the County issued two bond issues for a grand total of $157.0 million (20040 in
the amount 0f $7.9 million and 2004!) in amount of million}.. Thereafter. no additional bond
funding has been issued by Cook County to meet Self-Insurance requirements. The $101.1 million
de?cit in the Self-Insurance fund as of November 30. 2008 includes a $23.9 million working cash
transfer plus a $1.1 million cash transfer to be provided from the Unknown Heirs Fund maintained by
the Cook County Treasurer for a total of $30 million as approved by the Cook County Board on
November 25. 2003 for temporary self-insurance claims processing.

4 The balances contained in the Special Purpose Funds constitute numerous special purpose fund
accounts that were approved by the Cook County Board over a prolonged period of time. These funds
are to be used for the speci?c intended purpose only. For example. the Motor Fuel Tax Fund is used
primarily to fund road construction projects, the Circuit Court Documentation Fund is used primarily to
fund activities such as the micro?lming and micro?che of court documents for referencelarchiving
purposes. etc. An unfavorable negative cash balance, such as the Election Fund. indicates that the
speci?c fund has not generated suf?cient property tax funding due to timing differences in the receipt of
revenue necessary to coincide with the election activity. Other special purpose funds consist of fee
revenue generated from operations such as the Circuit Court Automation Fund. The 2008 projected
property tax revenue to fund the Election Fund needs for FY 2009 is estimated to be $44 million which
will be received in 2009. if the property tax revenue meets expectations. the Election Fund will then
have a positive cash balance to meet future election activity needs.

5 The balances contained in the capital projects and capital equipment accounts represent bond funds
remaining from previous bond issues. The capital projects and capital equipment balance ties to the
column A amount shown on the Table 1 schedule presented to the Cook County Board for review on'

- January 18. 2009.

6 The balances contained in the grant accounts represent funds that are restricted for use to activities
pertaining to respective grantor requirements. Funds with negative (red) balance amounts will be
reimbursed to Cook County by the respective Federal and State grantors. The basic process requires
the County to pay grant related expenditures ?rst, submit a reimbursement voucher second. and then
the County replenishes the respective grant account accordingly.

7 The balance contained in the Agency Funds-Payroll Deduction account represents funds that have
been deducted from employee paychecks for Federal Tax withholding. State Tax Withholding.
Deferred Compensation. and Pension contributions which will be remitted to the various third parties
affected. These funds are restricted to paying the obligations associated with the respective
categories indicated herein.

For the Fiscal Month Ended October 31, 2008

JOHN R. MORALEIS, CPA
COUNTY come-mouse

The enclosed revenue report presents the ?scal revenue collection activity through October31.
2008. The total unfavorable variance for the ?scal eleven-month period was $30.9 million,
which represents a net increase of $9.1 million over the ?scal September 2008 revenue
variance of $21.6 million. The most signi?cant areas comprising the unfavorable revenue

variance as of October 31 2008 included:

Negative Variance

 

 

 

 

Revenue Center (Millions)
Recorder of Deeds 6.1
Sheriff-Court Services Fee 0.8
Chief Judge 8.4
Patient Fees 34.1
County Sales Tax 4.2
Gasr'Diesel Tax 4.1
Cigarette Tax 9.6
County Use Tax - 2.9
Sub Total T02
Other net positive variances (39.3)
Total net negative variance 30.9

The Recorder of Deeds indicated that there continues to be a downturn in the volume of real
estate transactions over last year's activity levels. 'The negative variance of $6.1 million was
$1.2 million higher than the $4.9 million unfavorable variance reported for the ?scal period

ended September 30, 2008.

The Sheriff Court Services Fee resulted in a cumulative unfavorable variance of $8 million
through the ?scal period ended October 31, 2008. due primarily to a decrease in ?ling fees. The
8.8 million unfavorable variance million less than the $1.0 million unfavorable variance
reported for the ?scal period ended September 30, 2008.

Due to the February 29, 2008 approval of the FY 2008 Budget, estimated revenue for the Court
Services and the Chief Judge Fees was substantially allocated to the revenue report beginning
in April 2008. Through the ?scal 2008 period ended October 31, 2008, estimated revenues for
the Of?ce of the Chief Judge were $8.4 million below budget representing a 8.7 million increase
above the million unfavorable variance reported for the ?scal period ended September 30,
2008. Based on the current collection rate activity as of October 31, 2008, it appears that the
overall revenue shortfall for the Of?ce of the Chief Judge may reach approximately $9.0 million
for ?scal year 2008. The projected shortfall for the Of?ce of the Chief Judge was initially
disclosed at the July 22. 2008 Board meeting, and status updates regarding the projected
revenue shortfall have been presented through to the October 1. 2008 Board meeting [August

31, 2008 Revenue Report].

Patient Fee revenue was $34.1 million below the estimated budget revenue through the ?scal
period ended October 31. 2008. The unfavorable variance increased $5.8 million above the
$28.3 variance reported for the ?scal period ended September 30, 2008. Staff continues to
closely monitor the revenue cycle operations as numerous scheduled revenue enhancement
improvements are currently in process. As indicated by the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System. periodic revenue estimate adjustments will be proposed as considered necessary via
Revenue Forecasts. Expenditure reduction initiatives to partially offset unfavorable
revenue variances are also in process. The expenditure reductions have included the delayed
hiring of staff and diligent monitoring of all line item expenditures for goods and services

throughout ?scal year 2008.

The County Sales Tax revenue for October 2008 re?ected a gross receipt amount of $58.8
million. The projected sales tax revenue amount was based on $2?.50 million at the prior
015% sales tax rate and $35.55 million at the new 1.00% sales tax rate, effective July 1, 2008.
for a total estimated sales tax revenue amount of $53.05 million. The $4.25 million 
unfavorable variance appears to be primarily attributable to a signi?cant downtum in consumer

economic con?dence and spending.

Based on the ?nal incremental sales tax revenue results, the actual FY 2008 sales tax revenue
shortfall through November 30, 2008 was $11.9 million, which represented a 2.99% unfavorable
variance to the initial sales tax revenue projection. On October 29, 2008 Cook County
deposited 10% of the sales tax revenue proceeds [principal and 3% interest] into the Sales Tax
Anticipation Note Fund for repayment with the assigned Trustee. in accordance with the Sales
Tax Anticipation Note agreement for October 2008.

The County Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Tax revenue fell below the budgeted revenue estimate by
$4.1 million through the ?scal period ended October 31, 2008. The unfavorable variance
decreased $3.0 million below the unfavorable $7.1 million variance reported for the ?scal period
ended September 30, 2008. Overall fuel consumption declined eariier in the ?scal year
primarily due to the steep increase in gasoline and diesel fuel prices. However. recent fuel
pricing trends and consumer demand appear to have improved markedly. The combined
positive changes have contributed to the decrease in the previous unfavorable fuel tax revenue
variances reported earlier. Future projected gasoline and diesel fuel tax revenues will be
evaluated closely to determine whether any adjustments will be required. Recent consumer

20

behavior appears to have moved towards an increased use of public transportation and to drive
more fuel ef?cient vehicles.

The County Cigarette Tax and Use Tax revenue fell below the budgeted revenue estimates by
$9.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively, through the ?scal period ended October 31, 2008.
The unfavorable variance for Cigarette Tax revenue for the ?scal period ended October 31,
2008 increased by $5 million, while the unfavorable variance for the Use Tax increased 
million in comparison to the results reported for the ?scal period ended September 30, 2008-
The current economic downturn has signi?cantly impacted automobile sales and overall
consumer spending. Unfavorable Cigarette Tax revenue appears to be primarily attributable to
the statewide smoking prohibition. The ?nance staff will continue to closely monitor collection

activity for both tax revenues.

Note I:

Revenue not previously reported upon concerning Resolution 0T-O-65, adopted by the Cook
County Board on October 16, 2007, for the establishment of an automated red light traf?c safety
system has not produced any budgeted revenue as of the ?scal period ended October 31, 2008.
The red light traf?c safety system was budgeted to generate $5.0 million of revenue in FY 2008.
The Cook County Highway Department is presently working to complete the recommended
vendor selection. to ?nalize the overall operational processes to be followed, and other
groundwork deemed necessary to meet the requirements of this Resolution. The ?nalization of
agreements between Cook County and selected various municipalities is also pending.

Note ll:

Revenue from the sale of real estate?land in the amount of $33 million was budgeted in the
Other Revenues portion of the FY 2008 Revenue Budget. Through the FYTD period ended
October 31, 2008, some offers for parcels of real estate available for sale have been received
but no ?nalization of any land sales wererealized as of November 30, 2008.

The timely reporting of the FY 2008 Cook County revenue is an extremely important ?nancial
management responsibility. Accordingly, there is generally a three~week timing difference in the
reporting of actual revenue received by all reporting entities to the Bureau of Finance to enable
the compilation of the ?nancial results. The ?nance staff will continue to closely monitor the
revenue collection activity for all revenue producing functions, and report the results to the
President and the Cook County Board on a basis, at a minimum, and more frequently if

deemed necessary.

Cook County Health and Hospitals System

SUBJECT: 2009 Operating Budget

On behalf of the Board of Directors I am taking this opportunity to respond to both the
discussions currently underway in your Committee regarding potential cuts to the recommended budget
for 2009, and to bring a couple of items to the attention of the Committee Members for consideration
during these discussions.

As you will recall, the was required, in a separate fashion, to submit a budget request for
deliberation and preliminary approval through the President?s O?ice to your Committee. During that
process the presented an initial budget request of $886.923346 on October 22, 2008. This
request represented an increase of $65.014.946 or 7.9 over the adopted 2008 Appropriation.

In response to initial conversations with all of the Commissioners and some concerns expressed about
the size of the increase requested, the CCI-IHS submitted a revised budget on October 27, 2008 at the
Budget hearing of that day, which included a $30,000,000 or 3.4% reduction. This reduction was
re?ected as a single line ?Appropriations Adjustment?, so that the Board of Directors could
exercise the authority given to it in deciding how best to implement adjustments to the detailed budget.
(Please note that the revised budget of that day also re?ected an adjustment to the turnover account of
$10,026,460 initiated by the County Budget of?ce thus changing the submission to $866,949,806)

My understanding from listening to the Finance Committee meetings of this week was the consideration
of a range of cut scenarios from the 2009 Recommended Budget submitted by the President, which of

course included the Budget that was preliminarily approved at $866, 949,806 (exclusive of the
899 Fund). I ?n'ther understood that these out scenarios would consider any budget submitted that had
already included reductions, i.e. if a department or Elected Of?cial had submitted a budget with a out,
such a cut would be recognized against the various cut scenarios being considered (4-696).

With that said we are not in agreement with the schedule for the Health F1_1nd contained withi1_t
the ?Cuts for Recommendation? submitted bv the Cook County Bigget Director Mr. Reinhold a_t
yesterday?s Finance Committee meeting, in that it does not take into account our $30,000,000
Elation already contained as part of our prescribed budget review process) within the

Recommended Budget.

We would respectfully submit that the $3 0,000,000 cut that the has already adopted within the
preliminarily approved budget be recognized. The cuts for further consideration as part of the Cook
County Budget Director?s schedule would therefore be amended as follows:

 

Recommended total 4% cut total 5% cut total 6% cut
[i_ncl. original cut) frOm recomm. from recomm. from recomm.
$866,949,806 $866,949,806 $861,078,609 $854,350,898

($30,000,000 cut) ($30,000,000 cut) ($35,499,090 cut) ($42,598,908 cut)

Finally, again in keeping with the enabling ordinance and the authority given to the Board of
Directors, we would request that if there indeed is a further out to the preliminary budget by the County
Board (for the purpose of reserving for self insurance claims), such a out be re?ected in the single line
item for ?Appropriations Adjustment? so that the Board of Directors can make the ?nal
determination at to where, and how, to refashion the System budget based upon the ?nal total
appropriation that is ultimately adopted by the County Board.

Without a final approved appropriation to work with, it is not possible for the to respond to the
Cook County Budget Director?s request (by this Friday) to detail out speci?c position changes, or other
line item account changes, at the business unit level. Should there be an approved appropriation that is
less than the request of the Preliminary Budget, the CCHI-IS Board of Directors will over see the
adjustment to the detailed operating budgets and then submit it to the Cook County Budget Director?s
of?ce for entry into the budget system.

It is very clear that in general any additional cut to the appropriation request contained within the
Preliminary Budget, beyond the $30,000,000 the CCI-II-IS Board of Directors has already
pledged to make, will result in a combination of ?lled positions being reduced (thus lay?off of
personnel), resulting in healthcare serviceslpro grams being signi?cantly out andl'or eliminated from the
current levels provided, as well as other line item expense reductions.

I thank you and the Commissioners for your consideration of this communication and as always am
available to answer any questions.

JJEMORANDUM FOR DA VID SW

From: Mott Powers, HMH
Subject: House Economic Stimulus Bil! uPreliminory Analysis
Date: January 22, 2009

House of Representatives Appropriations Committee chairman, David Obey (D WI), introduced
on Thursday, January 15, 2009, an $825 billion economic stinmlus package (The American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009), designed to give the US economy a boost out of this
recession. Since the bill will need to move through a variety of committees and negotiations

during the legislative process, this is certainlv a dm?c process and can be egpected to change.

Medicaid Aid to States (FMAP): $87 billion to state; increasing through the end of FY 2010 the
share of Medicaid costs the Federal government reimburses all states by 4.9 percent, with
additional relief tied to rates of unemploymentl

II A state?s FMAP shall be maintained from FY 2008 through the 151 quarter of FY 201 1.
This means that any FMAP for a state lower than any previous ?scal year going back to
FY 2008 shall be substituted with the greatest FMAP in any previous ?scal year in that
same period.2

i There is an additional FMAP adjustment made for high unemployment states, or states in
which unemployment has increased by 1.5 percentage points or more. The adjustment is
three?tiered, with higher adjustments for states in which unemployment has increase by
2.5 and 3.5 percentage points or more.3

0 Finally, there is a blanket FMAP increase of 4.9 percentage points to each state for
calendar quarters during the recession adjustment period. This increase is not motored
into the high unemployment state FMAP arijustment.?1

Medicaid Covegge for the Unemployed: $8.6 billion to provide 100 percent Federal funding
through 2010 for optional State Medicaid coverage of individuals (and their dependents) who are
involuntarily unemployed and whose family income does not exceed a State-determined level,
but is no higher than 200 percent of poverty, or who are receiving food stamps}

Health Information Technoloav Adoption: $20 billion to encourage the adoption of electronic
medical records, which many health experts agree could increase the e?iciency of care and cut
doom on medical errors. Hospitals and physicians have been slow to adopt the technology
because of Its cost.?5

President-Elect Ohama was quoted in USA Today setting February 16, 2009 as a ?hard deadline?
for Congress to pass the stimulus bill? Judging by some states? reactions, the expectation is that
money would begin ?owing quickly to states. Missouri is scrambling to accelerate highway
project: planning for fear that stimulus money not used quickly will be reallocated to states ready
use it.

Mu: the Economic Stimius could meuufor Illinois

The majority of the funding will likely be deposited in the State General Fund, although some of
the funding will go to certain dedicated or special purpose funds. One way to crudely estimate the
impact for the state is that the total federal draw in Federal Fiscal Year 2008 (CMS 64) was about
$5.7 billion. Therefore, a 4.9% FMAP increase would have provided an additional $280 million
net ?rnding for the state of Illinois in FFY08. Since the temporary FMAP increase effectively
extends from October I, 2003 through December 3 l, 2010, the likely impact for the state will be
between $600?$700 million. It is noteworthy that some of this match will be drawn retroactively
since the e?'ective date is October 1, 2008.

Since the majority of this iiunding will be deposited in the State?s General Fund AND most state
agencies receive substantial funding from the State?s General Fund, this new revenue source will
be subject to the spending demands for virtually all state agencies (cg. elementary and secondary
education, public safety, etc). However, some policy-makers will make a strong case that health
care and health care for low-income Illinoisan should be prioritized since this revenue source is a
low-income health care revenue source. An analogous case was made nationally years ago that
master tobacco settlement revenues should go to fund anti-smoking initiatives. The same ?ght
over new revenues will likely take place. 

Overall state ?nances will complicate a potential argument for the prioritization of health care.
The State faces a $4 billion budget de?cit according to Comptroller Dan Hynes (January 9,
2009). ,This shortfall will only exasperate demand for General Fund dollars and fuel competition
between state agencies and interest groups for additional funding. -

An important note is that the bill only extends the moratorium on cost based regulations until July
2009. This is a critical piece that needs to be strengthened.

As indicated, there are considerable resources to provide for Medicaid health care coverage to the
recently unemployed and resources for health information technology ?mding. Details will be
provided at a later time for these initiatives.

Mat the Economic Stimubrs could manfor Cook Conant

Whereas the majority of the increased FMAP ?mding will be deposited in the State?s General
Fund, the County Provider Trust Fund (CPTF) will also bene?t. For example, the netted
approximately $215 million for the County in state ?scal year 2008. Increased FMAP by 4.9%
would have increased revenues by approximately $10 million. Therefore, given current trends, it
is reasonable to estimate that the CPTF would increase by 310?5: 15 million for the County in state
?scal year 2009. Over the course of 9 quarters, this could bene?t the CPTF (and County) by $20-
$25 million. The County?s impact for CFY 09 is estimated to be between $10-$15 million.

Additionally, given the large injection of revenue for the state and the high level of
uncompensated care and the high volume of Medicaid patients, Cook County would be able to
make a strong case for a higher proportion of this stimulus money, particularly given that its
purpose is to ease the burden of rising Medicaid rolls and spending. This would have to be vetted
through the Spring legislative process where budget decisions are made.

To a lesser extent, the could bene?t ?'om portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid
Covegge for the Unemployed. This could help to temporarily offset the substantial
uncompensated care burden. Lastly the Health Information Technology portion of the bill makes

2

28

hospitals eligible for additional payments from Medicare and Medicaid of at least $2 million if
they adopt electronic medical records before FY 2013. Maximum payments could be greater than
$4 million, depending on their size and the amount of their Medicare payments. A large hospital
that accepted only Medicare, Medicaid and charity patients could theoretically be paid as much as
$11.6 million. Additionally, beginning in FY 2016, health providers and hospitals that do not
adopt HIT would be penalized with reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments.9

It has been proposed in Committee to raise state DSH allotments by This could have a
positive impact upon CCI-IHS approximately $5 million dollars. The moratorium extension
through July of2009 is a major concern.

Samoa

Stay tuned as the bill was just introduced.

Remain cautiously optimistic regarding the CPTF revenue increase and some potential
retroactive ?rnding. The potential estimated ?nancial gain to the System in CFY 09 is
estimated to be $10?$15 million. More details will be forthcoming as the bill progresses
and details are clari?ed.
