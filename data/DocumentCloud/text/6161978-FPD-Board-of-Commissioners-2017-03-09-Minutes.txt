North Branch Trail. This agreement covers the approximately two thousand eight hundred (2,800) linear
feet of trails that will be built on Forest Preserve property on the south side of Old Orchard Road.
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Agreement Period: Perpetual (subject to termination after ten (10) years)
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/A
District(s): 13
Summary: Skokie has requested an Intergovernmental Agreement to construct the proposed Trail
Connection. Skokie has obtained Transportation Alternatives Program funding for the construction of
Stage 1 of Trail Connection. Skokie will be responsible for all design, permitting and construction costs
associated with the Trail Connection, subject to review of final plans and specifications by the Preserves.
All requirements regarding insurance and bonds must be met. It is anticipated that approximately one
hundred and ten (110) trees will be removed for this project. For each tree that is removed, Skokie will
plant replacement trees or pay the replacement cost of planting the trees. The Preserves anticipates that
the Trail Connection will be completed within approximately five (5) years. Skokie will be responsible
for long-term maintenance of the Trail Connection upon completion, including annual inspections and
snow removal. The Preserves, however, will retain responsibility for trimming and removing trees. The
Intergovernmental Agreement is subject to final review and approval by the Preserves’ Legal
Department.

PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
REQUEST TO REGISTER BOBOLINK MEADOW AS AN ILLINOIS LAND AND WATER
RESERVE (“ILWR”)
Department:

Resource Management

Summary: Requesting authority, pursuant to Section 9 of the Cook County Forest Preserve District Act
(70 ILCS810/9), to register Bobolink Meadow as an Illinois Land and Water Reserve ("ILWR") with the
Illinois Nature Preserve Commission (“INPC”).
This dedication contributes to one of the key goals set forward in the Next Century Conservation Plan to
dedicate and register twenty thousand (20,000) acres with the INPC by 2025. Dedication of a site as an
ILWR provides a high level of protection for land in Illinois, and is granted only to natural areas of
important ecological quality.
The proposed Bobolink Meadow ILWR is an approximately nine hundred and eighteen (918) acre
portion of the preserves located in Tinley Park in south central Cook County. The site currently supports
four hundred and sixty eight (468) plant species and one hundred and forty two (142) bird species, five
(5) of which are threatened or endangered in Illinois. The site also provides critical breeding habitat for
declining grassland birds, including the second largest population of Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus)
in the state of Illinois.
The Forest Preserves of Cook County (“FPCC”) currently has twenty three (23) dedicated Nature
Preserves and three (3) Land and Water Reserves. The addition of Bobolink Meadow ILWR would bring
the FPCC's total INPC protected lands to approximately 8,800 acres.
It is respectfully requested that authority be granted to the FPCC to submit Bobolink Meadow to the
Illinois Nature Preserve Commission for review and formal dedication as an Illinois Land and Water
Reserve.
