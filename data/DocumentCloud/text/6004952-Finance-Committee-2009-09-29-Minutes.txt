C. Presentation of Year-to-Date Financials through June 2009 (Attachment #2)
 

Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
presented the Year-to-Date Financials through June 2009.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.

D. Update on FY2010 Budget
Pitt Calkin provided an update on the FY2010 Budget. He stated that the County Board approved the
System’s FY2010 Preliminary Budget, but he cautioned that the County Board could still amend it on the
floor when they consider the President’s Recommendations for the entire County’s budget.
Additionally, Mr. Calkin stated that a letter was received from the County’s Department of Budget and
Management. Their original directive was for agencies to prepare their budgets with a 19% reduction; this
was in preparation for a possible sales tax rollback. Because the President’s veto of the sales tax rollback
was sustained, the Budget Department has instead issued a directive for agencies to prepare their budgets
with a 5% reduction. Mr. Calkin stated that the System’s FY2010 Preliminary Budget complied with the
19% reduction directive (by submitting a budget that had a 19% reduction on the tax subsidy received from
the County); the Budget Department was informed that the System will not be revising their budget at this
time.

Misconceptions

- Chamberlin Edmonds is not a sole provider of the type of
services that are contemplated by their recent contract.

Competitive bid process should have been used, by law.
requirements should not be waived.

- We were never approached by anyone to put peOple on-site
as Chamberlin Edmonds was in 2008 (over a year ago).

We could have, and still can, provide the same level of service and
training.

Mlsconceptlons
- 87% of referrals to Great Lakes Medicaid are disabilities.

We work 21"d placements, but still have a higher approval rate than
Chamberlin Edmonds, who received placements.

This was a misstatement by Gretchen Ryan at the Finance
Committee meeting on July 24, 2009.
- Large hospitals and hospital systems do use 2 vendors.

At least for performance comparison purposes.

This was a misstatement by Ulrich Brechbuhl, CEO of Chamberlin
Edmonds at the August 7, 2009 Finance Committee meeting.

Misconceptions

GLM has not received any ?special project? referrals in the

last 18 months (Page 3 of MedAssets presentation, July 24,
2009)

Only ?Special Project? work was given in July 2007 when
Chamberlin Edmonds was non-competitively brought in and the
current system was implemented.

Misconceptions

Chamberlin Edmonds?s low conversion rate in comparison

to other vendors cannot be explained away by a super?cial
comparison of the caseload make?up:

The 2009 numbers are only for cases referred in CY 2009
(Comments of Gretchen Ryan at Finance Committee meeting of
July 24, 2009).

- There have been no special project referrals in 2009.
caseload in 2009 is 87% disability referrals.

- If ?ling a timely Medicaid application, there should be no
reason that any cases would have to ?convert to Medicaid?.

It appears that they failed to ?le a timely application with the state of
Illinois Medicaid of?ces, which in our business is tantamount to
malpractice.

Misconceptions

- Chamberlin Edmonds was hired to provides services at all
3 hospitals:
They decided not to work at Oak Forest and Provident Hospitals.

Great Lakes works at all 3 hospitals, providing full-time employees
at all three.

- Medicaid eligibility/ SDI services or placing trained
people to screen at hospitals are not ?specialized services,?
requiring a sole source contract:

Summary

0 Awarding Chamberlin Edmonds this contract is not in the best
interests of the or the taxpayers of Cook County.

The fees appear to be high, with both a ?at fee and a contingent,
percentage fee.

0 Under the current contract, current fee is only 7.75% to cap of
$2,175.00, Chamberlin Edmonds? is 9.5% with no cap.

Fee on $100,000 case: fee is $2,175.00, Chamberlin Edmonds?s fee is
$9,500.00.

Summary

Public contracts should not give a guarantee of expense
recoupment.

No reason to waive any reason for termination:

Performance should be key to contract award and retention.

By any impartial, reasonable standard, Chamberlin Edmonds?
performance was not best of the vendors.

Contract should be undeniably in the best interests of the
taxpayers of Cook County.

The new Chamberlin Edmonds contract should containt the right to
terminate for convenience.

Summary

- GLM remains willing and able to provide services to the

should the opportunity arise or the current situation
change.

- Simply ask that you not make the pending contract exclusive

for any period of time to Chamberlin Edmonds or any
Medicaid vendor.

Also ask that you not make it non-terminable for any length of

time:

This allows your new executive team the ability to remain ?exible as

they implement their own plan of action for the Cook County Health

 Summary
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System year to date financial
results finished the seventh month of the fiscal year ahead of budget by
$109,324,751. The overall revenue excess at the end of the seventh month
was $97,047,243. Expenses were below budget by $12,277,509 or 2.0%.
Operating Revenue
Fees at the end of June collected from patient services were above budget
year to date by $5,637,359 or 3.4%. The number of Medicare visits is
down this year compared to the same period last year.
Other Revenue at the end of June is below the budget by $838,917 or
20.3%. Prior year revenues included one time payments which was
factored into the 2009 budget.
FMAP and NetDSH are recognized on a accrual basis to Budget.
Total Operating Revenue at the end of June was above budget year to
date by $112,439,666 or 39.1%.
In June 2009, the Health and Hospitals System received a net lump sum
payment from the State of Illinois of $135 million. This lump sum
payment was negotiated with the state as part of the new
intergovernmental agreement between the state and the County. One of
the major features of the new agreement is the lowering of reimbursement
rates for inpatient stays for the system beginning July, 2008. Included in
this amount was a payment of approximately $50 million net for hospital
bills adjudicated after June, 2008. These bills were adjudicated at the
older “higher reimbursement” rates. As a result, the State of Illinois will
be withholding inpatient payments to the three hospitals based on the
newly negotiated rates until this amount is repaid. These amounts were
withheld beginning in July, 2009 and anticipated that the recoupment
period could last from 4-5 months at Stroger to as long as a year or more
at Provident. A full presentation showing the effect of the new agreement
This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
Page 38 of 98

 and its impact on the current and future budgets of the Health and
Hospitals System is planned for the Finance Committee meeting on
September 29, 2009.
Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses at the end of June were below budget by $12,277,509
or 2.0%. This favorable expense performance was due to positive
variances for Supplies, Purchased Services, and Utilities. Salaries and
Employee Benefits were under the budget year to date.

Salaries and Wages – $27,159,425 or 8.2%
Salaries and wages were below the budget at the end of June due to the
FY 2009 Budget not being approved until mid-February which resulted in
none of the new budgeted positions being recruited for.

Benefits - $3,841,614 or 8.2%
The level of Benefit expense is directly related to salary and wage
expense. Benefits for employees are below the budget because salaries
and wages are also below the budget.

Supplies – $2,500,000 or 2.7%
Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget year
to date. The System is using the accrual convention to estimate supply
expense based on the budgeted expenditures minus any documented
savings to date.
In comparison to the prior year, the estimated YTD June 30, 2008 supply
expense of $63,352,309 ($48,053,076 as of YTD June ’09) was based on
actual expense taken from the Comptroller’s ledger of actual items paid
by the County. During the preparation of the prior year’s report, there
were no attempts to estimate an accrual for any missing expenses.
This information is an integral part of the
accompanying
consolidated financial statements
Page
39 of 98

 Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $2,100,000 or 2.2%
The year to date level expenses for the System for this category continues
to be significantly below the budget. The method used to estimate
expense is the same for purchased services as is used for supplies.
Similar to supplies, the prior YTD June 30, 2008 estimated purchase
services, rental, and other expense amount of $66,798,256 ($41,850,411
as of YTD June ’09) was based on expenses taken from the Comptroller’s
ledgers.

Utilities - $2,459,592 or 19.8%
The estimated System year to date expense for utilities in total is below
budget. The accrual convention to estimate this expense is based on total
YTD bills, paid and unpaid, received by the Cook County Industrial
Engineer responsible for processing the utility bills for the County.
Similar to supplies, the prior YTD June 30, 2008 estimated utilities
expense of $10,084,812 ($7,778,645 as of YTD June ’09) was also taken
from the Comptroller’s ledgers.

To increase Contract # 09-41-73 previously approved by the System Board on
February 26,2009 to participate in the existing State of Illinois Maintenance,
Repair and Operational (M.R.O.) contract with W. W. Grainger, Inc., Palatine,
Illinois for the purchase of institutional maintenance, repair and operations
supplies.
This contract has saved approximately $54,000 in terms of difference between
the catalog and actual price paid for Grainer products. Stroger Hospital would
have paid the catalog price if not joined with the State of Illinois contract for the
first time this year. We estimate that an additional $100,000 is needed to cover
all expected and unforeseen expenses for maintenance equipment and supplies
to be purchased in the next few months. Year end expense data will reveal a
more realistic usage of this contract and better prepare us for FY 201 0
