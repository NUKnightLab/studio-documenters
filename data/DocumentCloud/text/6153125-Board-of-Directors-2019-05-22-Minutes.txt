On a motion by Ms. Washington, seconded by Mr. Gonzalez, DBRA Resolution Code 1905-03-186 was unanimously approved.
Corporate Resolution for Investment Account
Mr. Long presented the Corporate Resolution for Investment Account to the DBRA Board.
The Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) has traditionally used CDs in order to
earn interest income on any excess funds. As the DBRA’s role has evolved, the DBRA has
brought on much more in cash reserves and its traditional savings vehicle is no longer sufficient.
DBRA staff have sought to identify an investment strategy which will better align with the DBRA’s
current, and future, financial status. Further, as a public corporation, the DBRA is required to
comply with the provisions of Public Act 20 of 1943 when making cash investments. Thus, DBRA
staff have identified Federated Funds (“Federated”) as the optimal vehicle to invest its excess
cash. Federated is utilized by the Downtown Development Authority for the investment of its

 excess cash, has a fund that invests in Government obligations, and will concentrate on principal
preservation. Also, the fund meets the requirements of Public Act 20 of 1943.
DBRA staff are requesting that the Board approve the attached Resolution authorizing Staff to
open a new investment account with Federated; and invest money into, or liquidate money out of,
the account. In connection with this Board’s approval of such account with Federated, Glen Long,
Chief Financial Officer of Detroit Economic Growth Corp (“DEGC”), and Kelly Shovan, Controller,
DEGC will be the two staff members who are authorized to move the money between the DBRA’s
investment and checking accounts.
A Resolution is attached for your consideration.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Corporate Resolution for Investment Account, as
presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. George, seconded by Mr. Gonzalez, DBRA Resolution Code 19-0501-210 was unanimously approved.
PROJECTS

Agreement with Conrail
Ms. Navin presented the Industrial Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Purchase
and Sale Agreement with Conrail to the DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, in connection with the industrial land assembly project undertaken by the
City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) at the request of the City of Detroit
(the “City”), on February 27, 2019, (DBRA 19-02-262-08), the DBRA approved that certain
Memorandum of Understanding by and between FCA US LLC (“FCA”), DBRA and the City (the
“MOU”) relating to the following investment proposed by FCA in the city of Detroit (the “Project”):
•

•

Construct a new assembly plant at the site of its current Mack Engine Plant located at
Mack and St. Jean, with an estimated investment of $1.6 billion and creation of
approximately 3,850 net new full-time jobs; and
Invest approximately $900 million at its Jefferson North Assembly Plant (“JNAP”), located
at Jefferson and St. Jean, creating approximately 1,100 net new full-time jobs.

The Board previously approved the acquisition of all properties required for the Project set forth
on Exhibit A, with the exception of those parcels owned by Consolidated Rail Corporation
(“Conrail”) which comprise a portion of Site 12. DBRA staff has negotiated proposed terms of
purchase with Conrail as described on Exhibit B and seeks the Board’s approval to negotiate and
execute a purchase agreement upon the terms and conditions described on Exhibit B in support
of the Project.
A resolution is attached for the Board’s consideration.
Mr. George asked if the money in the escrow account will accumulate interest. Ms. Navin stated
that it is possible for the money in the escrow account to accumulate interest.
Ms. McClain asked if the easement requested by Conrail would make it possible for Conrail to
reactivate the rail line. Ms. Navin confirmed that the easement requested by Conrail would make

 it possible for Conrail to reactivate the rail line and stated that the easement agreement has not
yet been negotiated.
Ms. DeSantis asked what the anticipated use is for the land subject to the easement. Ms. Navin
stated that the anticipated use for the land subject to the easement is finished vehicle parking and
trailer marshalling, and that if Conrail decides that is would like to reactivate and move the existing
rail line to the easement, FCA would be required to remove the improvements made and install a
rail line.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the easement by Conrail is a risk for FCA. Ms. Navin confirmed that the
easement by Conrail is a risk for FCA.
Mr. George asked if FCA anticipates using the existing rail line for its own operations. Ms. Navin
stated that FCA has identified another site for rail use.
Ms. DeSantis asked how the purchase price for this property compares to the purchase prices for
other property acquired for the land assembly project. Ms. Navin stated that the purchase price
for this property is consistent with the purchase prices for other property acquired for the land
assembly project. Ms. Bridges added that the purchase prices for property acquired for the land
assembly project were based on sales comparisons and were approximately $1-2 per square
foot.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the purchase price was an issue for Conrail. Ms. Navin stated that the
purchase price was not an issue for Conrail and that Conrail was reluctant to sell the land because
it did not want to give up the property regardless of the purchase price.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Industrial Land Assembly Project: Authorization to
Enter into Purchase and Sale Agreement with Conrail, as presented. The Board took the following
action:
On a motion by Mr. George, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code 19-05262-22 was unanimously approved.

 SOMA Brownfield Redevelopment Plan: Reimbursement Agreement
Mr. Vosburg presented the Reimbursement Agreement for the SOMA Brownfield Plan to the
DBRA Board.
On March 13, 2018, the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (the “DBRA”) Board of
Directors recommended approval to City Council of the Brownfield Plan for the SOMA
Redevelopment Project (the “Plan”). The City Council public hearing for the Plan was held May
2, 2019 and City Council approved the Plan on May 7, 2019. A requirement for Tax Increment
Financing reimbursement pursuant to the Plan is that a Reimbursement Agreement (the
“Agreement”) be entered into between the DBRA and Woodward Mack 22, LLC. The Agreement
has been prepared between the DBRA and Woodward Mack 22, LLC and is presented to the
DBRA for review and approval.
Project Introduction
Woodward Mack 22, LLC, is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails the
activation of an alleyway, the redevelopment of the former Eliot Street, and the new construction
of a parking deck to support the rehabilitations occurring at 115 Erskine and the nearby 100 Mack
Avenue office buildings into Class A space. The project will include the demolition of an existing
surface parking lot, the rehabilitation of an office building located at 115 Erskine and other current
site features to restore the urban fabric of the area. The parking deck will be an integral part of
restoring the office building occupancy and is also needed to support the proposed redevelopment
nearby. A 6-story parking structure (totaling approximately 580 spaces) with ground floor retail
(totaling approximately 6,730 square feet) is the cornerstone to jumpstarting these efforts to grow
the SOMA (South of Mack Avenue) District. The property will contain retail space on the first floor
and support mixed use within the SOMA District, including adjacent retail, commercial and a
proposed future hotel.
The total investment is estimated to be between $20 and $22 million. The Developer is requesting
$10M in TIF reimbursement though it is projected that only approximately $7.2M will be captured
under the Plan. It is currently expected that this project will create approximately 100 temporary
construction jobs and 200 permanent jobs.

ADMINISTRATIVE
DBRA Comprehensive General Liability Insurance: Policy Premium Increase
Ms. Kanalos presented DBRA Comprehensive General Liability Insurance: Policy Premium
Increase to the DBRA Board.
As the result of an audit of the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority’s (the “DBRA”)
Comprehensive General Liability (“CGL”) Insurance Policy conducted in April 2019 by Swett &
Crawford/James River Insurance Co., the CGL policy premium for 2017-2018 has been increased
by $8,402.95, in addition to the policy premium previously paid of $17,857.00 in December 2017
for a total of $26,259.95 for 2017-2018. The increase in the policy premium is largely due to
increase in the project activity and subsequently the DBRA application and processing fees
associated therewith. The improvement of the financial profile of the DBRA has resulted in an
increase in liability exposure, and as such, has resulted in the premium increase. Per DBRA

 resolution code 07-10-01-78, any increase in insurance policy premiums by more than fifteen
(15%) percent require DBRA Board approval.
A resolution approving the additional policy premium fee is attached for DBRA Board review and
approval.
Mr. George asked for confirmation that the policy increase is a result of the increased volume of
projects and revenue for the DBRA. Ms. Kanalos confirmed that the policy increase is a result of
the increased volume of projects and revenue for the DBRA.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the DBRA Comprehensive General Liability Insurance:
Policy Premium Increase, as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. George, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code 19-05-01211 was unanimously approved.
OTHER
None.
PUBLIC COMMENT
