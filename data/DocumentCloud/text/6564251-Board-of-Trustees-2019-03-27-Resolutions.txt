 Attachment A
Core Terms for a Three-Year Collective Bargaining Agreement

2020 = 2.5% for grades/steps that did not receive special adjustments in 2019
2021 = 2% for all grades/steps

Minimum wage raised to $15.00. Certain steps in wage grades 1-13 will receive special


New, streamlined wage step chart with elimination of Year 1 and Year 3 wage steps.
•



Healthcare/Insurance:
1. Effective in 2nd year (Jan. 1, 2020) – New plan design will be implemented with no
point-of-service charges, including elimination of all deductibles, coinsurance, and
copays.
2. New bi-weekly premium rates for the various tiers will be as follows, which represent
more equitable cost-sharing across the tiers:

Single

Existing per-pay premium rate,
which will continue for 2019

$80

Ee + spouse

Other Core Economic Terms:
: To reduce significant “overage” charges that MetroHealth pays,
1. AFSCME Care Plan
employees on the AFSCME Care Plan will be required to purchase all specialty drugs at
MetroHealth pharmacies.
2. MetroHealthy wellness incentive: During the three-year agreement, MetroHealth
agrees to maintain a wellness incentive program. For the 2020 incentive (which will be
based on wellness activities completed in 2019), incentive amounts will be available at
$200/$600/$800 levels for employee activities, with additional $100/$200/$300 incentive
levels available for wellness acti vities of an employee’s spouse/child(ren).

hours per week from the current 20 hours/week. Management will reevaluate this
increase after one year and may cease the increase.

 Operational Terms

To ensure that only qualified individuals who have demonstrated success are able to
move to other positions across the System based on union seniority, position transfers are
restricted where employees have a significant disciplinary history, as well as where
employees have been in their position for less than fifteen months (except for certain
promotional opportunities).

Numerous operational efficiencies and improvements in processes regarding
MetroHealth’s reporting obligations to the Union, job postings, effectuating schedule
changes to accommodate employee education, lateral transfers, bidding on promotional
opportunities, assigning employees to cover at off-site locations, layoff/recall processes,
employee discipline, and grievance processes.

Various committee arrangements by which the Union and MetroHealth can examine the
Union's ongoing concerns about the use of non-bargaining unit workers and part-time
employees.

 MHS BOARD POLICY
BOT-01 – Conflicts of Interest

Key Points
 This policy applies to The MetroHealth System and its affiliated or associated body’s boards
(“MetroHealth”).
 The MetroHealth Board of Trustees and any affiliated or associated body’s board members
(collectively, “Members”) are subject to federal and/or state conflicti.of interest laws
 Members owe a duty of loyalty to MetroHealth in all activities affecting MetroHealth.
 Members avoid any actual or potential conflicts between any personal interests he/she may
have and those interests of.
 This policy protects MetroHealth’s interest in the context of transactions or arrangements
ii
involving the private interest of a Member. All Members disclose Financial
and other
Interests
iii
activities that may be perceived as a Conflict of Interest.
Policy

1. General Principles. This policy supplements but does not replace any applicable county, sta
and federal laws governing Conflicts of Interest applicable to MetroHealth as a public
organization. In addition to supporting the general fiduciary duty of Members, this policy
supports MetroHealth’s compliance with applicable Ethics Laws.

1.1. Fiduciary Duty. Members have a fiduciary duty to the organization and Members exercis
the utmost good faith in all transactions related to their duties for MetroHealth. Membe
do not use their positions, or the knowledge gained therefrom, in such a way that a Con
of Interest might arise between the interest of MetroHealth and their personal interest.
General principles of fiduciary duty and state and federal laws prohibit all Members from
disclosing or using any confidential information acquired in the course of their official
duties.

1.2. Statutory Conflicts of Interest. Members comply with federal and state conflicts of intere
iv
and ethics laws
.

1.2.1.
These statutory conflicts of interest and ethics provisions are complex and require
careful evaluation of specific facts and circumstances pertaining to such personal o
private interest.
1.2.2.
The Ethics laws are criminal statutes and violation of such law could result in seriou
consequences.

2. Conflicts of Interest. In addition to statutory Conflicts of Interest, Members may have potent
Conflicts of Interest which, although not expressly prohibited by federal and state law, raise
issues of fiduciary duty. Such a Conflict of Interest may exist if a Member (directly or throug
Family Members or Business Associates) has an interest in or other financial arrangement w
an entity with which MetroHealth is engaging in a transaction or arrangement.

 MHS BOARD POLICY

2.1. Specific Prohibitions. Federal and state laws prohibit a Member (or his/herv Family Memb
vi
or any Business Associate
) from:
2.1.1.Having a private interest in a public contract unless an exception is available;
2.1.2.Using his or her authority or position to secure a public contract;
2.1.3.Using his or her office or position to secure anything of value; or
2.1.4.Soliciting or accepting anything of value.

2.2. Voting Restrictions. Any Member having a Conflict of Interest does not vote or use his/h
personal influence involving MetroHealth business.

2.3. Annual Statements. Upon appointment to the Board and annually thereafter, each Mem
submits a Conflict of Interest Disclosure Statement (Disclosure Statement) affirming tha
he/she:
2.3.1.
Received a copy of this Conflicts of Interest Policy,
2.3.2.
Completed the Disclosure Statement,
2.3.3.
Read and understands the Policy, and
2.3.4.
Agrees to comply with the Policy.

2.4. Duty to Disclose. A Member discloses the existence and nature of his or her personal or
private interest in connection with any actual or potential Conflicts of Interest in writing
the Chairperson of the Board when he/she becomes aware of a change or reasonably so
after it occurs (within 10 days).

2.4.1.
If a Member has a potential or actual Conflict of Interest and has not updated her/hi
Annual Statement, the Member discloses the Conflict to the Chief Legal Officer prior
a MetroHealth Board meeting.
2.4.2.
The Chair dismisses the Member while the remaining Members review the disclosur
and determine if a Conflict of Interest exists.
2.4.3.
The Member does not participate in the Board meeting while the personal or private
interest is discussed and voted upon.

2.5. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. The Chairperson of the Board refers a
actual and potential Conflicts of Interest to the SVP/Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer
review and determination of whether a Conflict exists. The SVP/Chief Ethics and
Compliance Officer consults the Chief Legal Officer regarding the determination of whet
a Conflict of Interest exists.

2.6. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy. If the Board has reasonable cause to believe
that a Member failed to disclose actual or potential Conflict(s) of Interest, the SVP/Chief
Ethics and Compliance Officer informs the Member of the basis for such belief and affor
the Member the opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.

2.7. Investigations of failed disclosures. SVP/Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, in consulta
with the Chief Legal Officer, investigates the circumstances regarding the failed disclosu

 MHS BOARD POLICY

If the Board determines that the Member failed to disclose an actual or potential Conflic
Interest, it takes appropriate corrective action.

2.8. Records of Proceedings. The minutes of the Board and all committees with Board delega
powers contain:

2.8.1.
The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a persona
or private interest in connection with an actual or potential Conflict of Interest, the
