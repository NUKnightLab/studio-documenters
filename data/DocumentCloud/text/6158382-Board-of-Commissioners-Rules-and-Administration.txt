WHEREAS, Cook County has recently re-formed the Cook County Homeland
Security and Emergency Management Department (CCHSEM) under the office of
the President; and
WHEREAS, the CCHSEM department is charged with overseeing the use of
federal funds in suburban Cook County and providing a county-wide emergency
management system that integrates available first responders, their departments
and their resources; and
WHEREAS, it is the goal of the new CCHSEM department to improve our current
emergency management system and preparedness capabilities in light of a recent
scathing report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on the state of
emergency preparedness in the Chicago area; and
WHEREAS, due to the importance of this department and its goals to coordinate
and prepare for disasters it is incumbent upon this board to ensure the departments
diligence in this vein and up to date on its progress; and
WHEREAS, the best way to ensure the timely flow of information is to form a new
committee to oversee the CCHSEM department.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President
and the Board of Commissioners do hereby resolve to create the new Cook County
Homeland Security and Emergency Management Committee effective immediately.
