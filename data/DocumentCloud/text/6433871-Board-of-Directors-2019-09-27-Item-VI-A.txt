 Challenges and Opportunities
We Lack
• Established guidelines, as
this is a cutting edge strategy

• Data related to local food
systems, especially for
suburban Cook County
• Additional resources to
implement this initiative; we
are relying on existing
resources and partnerships

We Need To Build
•

Inclusive, values-based procurement
process within Cook County

•

Readiness and capacity of local food
producers/businesses owned by people of
color or residing in low- to moderateincome communities to meet Good Food
standards and supply chain requirements

•

Idea that good food is a right, instead
of just a privilege
16

 Next Steps
•

•

•

•

Complete baseline assessments with CCH, CCSO, and JTDC
Continue to act on incorporating GFPP language in vendor solicitations
and contracts
Work to increase readiness and capacity of local food producers and
businesses of color or from low to moderate-income communities
Finalize evaluation plan and secure resources for implementation
