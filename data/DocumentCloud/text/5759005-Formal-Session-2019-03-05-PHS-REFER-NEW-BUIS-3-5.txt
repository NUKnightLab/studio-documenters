the approved time frame for rehabilitation.

We recommend that utility disconnect actions cease to allow the progress of the rehabilitation.

At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that conditions of the deferral

(Open Parking District) into a PD (Planned Development District). The approval was subject to
several conditions including the execution of a Maintenance Agreement with the City of Detroit
Department of Public Works City Engineering Division with respect to the 20 foot wide north-
south alley adjacent t018145 and 18147 Mack Avenue. The Maintenance Agreement was executed
and recorded August 5, 2011 in Liber 49309, pages 542-573, Wayne County Records.

At this time storage? aka Mack Avenue Investors, LLC wants to grant to the City of Detroit
an Easement for Public Access and Use. The existing Maintenance Agreement will be amended to
include the subject easement area. The request was approved by City Engineering DPW and the
City of Detroit Law Department.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

Subject: Re: Property issue

 

February 25. 2019,

To Whom It May Concern:

I'm writing in response to my property at 5826 Rohns the side lot that I own; and my driveway adjacent to
5838/5840. When the demolition company tore down the property at 5820 Rohns a portion of my driveway was
utilized. The demolition company (Armando) gained access to the property by driving the heavy-duty
equipment across part of my driveway. The use of this hefty equipment caused more devastation to my already
damaged driveway. The concrete in the driveway has cracked even further and it has begun to sink.

In regards to the property at 5826 Rohns, the company used contaminated top soil, which included crushed
waste stack, brick, wood and other debris. This restrains my family and I from being able to safely use the
property. I would appreciate your assistance with this matter.

Regards.
Jerry Taylor
