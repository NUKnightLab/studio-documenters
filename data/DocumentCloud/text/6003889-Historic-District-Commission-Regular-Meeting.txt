AGENDA

STAFF REPORT 5-8-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6186
ADDRESS: 112 EDMUND PLACE
APPLICANT: JOHN SKOK
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BRUSH PARK
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 5-2-2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
As per the attached photos, the proposed project area is a vacant lot that is located in the Brush
Park Historic District. The project parcel sits in an area which is dominated by residential uses.
An historic-age, 2-1/2 story dwelling, known as the Lucien Moore House, is located to the east
of the 112 Edmund parcel. A paved parking lot and an 8-story apartment building, known as the
Carlton, is north of the 112 Edmund parcel, across Edmund Place. The historic-age, 2-1/2 story
JL Hudson house is west of the 2827 John R/105 Alfred building.
Please see the attached staff report from the 6/13/2018 HDC regular meeting which notes that
the property owners presented an application to this body which included a proposal to erect a
new 7-story building (with underground parking) at 112 Edmund. The proposed design called
for the installation of cement fiberboard cladding at much of the building’s exterior walls, the
canting of the west elevation, a raised soffit line at stories 2 and 3, a brick-clad balcony with
integrated brick planter at the 2nd story, and a fully glazed elevation at the front/north façade,
stories 1 and 2. The proposed new building was presented as part of a larger development which
also included the erection of a new building at 105 Alfred and an addition to the carriage house
at 2827 John R. The Commission approved the entire development proposal at the 6/13/2018
meeting, to include the design of the new building at 112 Edmund.
With the current proposal, the applicant has revised 112 Edmund’s design, to include a
reduction in height, from 80’-0” to a height of 68’-0” at the northern 2/3 of the building (5
stories) and 55’-6” at southern 1/3 of the building 4 stories) and cladding the entire building in
white brick. Metal mesh balconies will also be added at all elevations. Also, please note that
the building’s front elevation will not share the same setback as the Lucien Moore House.
Specifically, it will push 25 feet north of the historic building’s front face at zero lot line.
Please see the attached renderings, which present images that compare the initially
submitted/approved design to the current proposal/revised design.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS
Note that the applicant has also attached a narrative which outlines the manner in which they feel
that their design conforms to the district’s Elements of Design. Also, see the submitted letter
from the Brush Park CDC, which indicates that the organization had concerns re: the initial
design’s 7-story height. Several residents from the nearby Carlton Building had also expressed
concerns with the proposed 7-story/80’ height proposed in the original design. The applicant has
noted that they dropped the height to 5 stories (primary/northern portion of the building) and 4
stories (rear portion of the building) in a bid to address those concerns. A review of the belowlisted Elements of Design for the district state that“ Height varies in the district from one (1) to

 eleven (11) stories. In the area between Woodward and Brush, the original development was
almost exclusively two and one-half (21/2) story houses…. All other buildings more than four
(4) stories in height are located between Woodward and John R., and generally on or
immediately adjacent to buildings on those streets.” The building height does conform to the
Elements of Design.
In re: the fact that the building does not share the Lucien Moore building’s setback, the applicant
has noted that they had to max out the lot due to the elimination of the underground parking and
for the development to meet city parking requirements. The applicant has made a number of
gestures towards mitigating the new building’s impact on the adjacent historic home, to include
the height reduction and canting the building at the 2nd-story, primary elevation to allow for a
clear siteline to the Lucien Moore Mansion.
APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1)

Height. Height varies in the district from one (1) to eleven (11) stories. In the area between
Woodward and Brush, the original development was almost exclusively two and one-half (21/2)
story houses. Later changes included the construction of apartment buildings among the houses,
the majority of which are three (3) stories in height. The tallest building, the former Detroiter
Hotel, is located on Woodward Avenue in the commercial strip. All other buildings more than
four (4) stories in height are located between Woodward and John R., and generally on or
immediately adjacent to buildings on those streets. East of Brush, the original development
ranged from one (1) to two and one-half (21/2) stories. Later redevelopment includes apartment
buildings not more than four (4) stories tall, most often located on Brush. In the case of the
nineteenth century houses located between Woodward and Brush, the two and one-half (21/2)
story height implies more height in feet than usual, since ceiling heights in these houses are
unusually high.

(2)

Proportion of building's front facade. Buildings in the district are usually taller than wide;
horizontal proportions exist only in incompatible later buildings, except for row house buildings.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the facade. Areas of void generally constitute between fifteen (15)
percent and thirty-five (35) percent of the total facade area, excluding roof. Proportions of the
openings themselves are generally taller than wide; in some cases, vertically proportioned units
are combined to fill an opening wider than tall.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facade. Victorian structures in the district often display great
freedom in the placement of openings in the facades, although older examples are generally more
regular in such placement than later examples. In later apartments, openings tend to be very
regular.

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The area between Woodward and Brush appears to
have been developed in a very regular spacing, with fifty (50) foot lots. This regularity has been
disrupted by the demolition of many of the houses, and the vacant land resulting, as well as the
occasional combination of lots for larger structures, particularly close to Woodward. East of
Brush, smaller lots were used in subdividing, but many buildings stand on more land than one lot,
and the parcel sizes are now quite irregular, as is the placement of buildings.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Most buildings have or had a porch or entrance
projection. The variety inherent in Victorian design precludes the establishment of any absolute

 rhythm, but such projections were often centered. On Woodward, the commercial nature of most
buildings and the widening of Woodward has effectively eliminated such projections.
(7)

Relationship of materials. By far the most prevalent material in the district is common brick;
other forms of brick, stone and wood trim are common; wood is used as a structural material only
east of Brush. Some later buildings have stucco wall surfaces. Originally, roofs were wood or
slate with an occasional example of tile; asphalt replacement roofs are common.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is the lowrelief pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smoother or rougher surfaces of stone or
wood trim. Slate, wood, or tile roofs contribute particular textural values where they exist,
especially in the case of slates or shingles of other than rectangular shape.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Brick red predominates, both in the form of natural color brick and in the
form of painted brick. Other natural brick and stone colors are also present. These relate to
painted woodwork in various colors, and there is an occasional example of stained woodwork.
Roofs of other than asphalt are in natural colors; older slate roofs are often laid in patterns with
various colors of slate. Original color schemes for any given building may be determined by
professional analysis of the paint layers on the building, and when so determined are always
appropriate for that building.

(10)

Relationship of architectural detail. On the buildings of the Victorian period, elaborate detail in
wood, stone, or sheet metal was common; areas treated include porches, window and door
surrounds, cornices, dormers, and other areas. Later buildings are generally simpler, but include
less elaborate detail in similar areas.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. Examples of many roof shapes, including pitched gable roofs, hip
roofs, mansard roofs, and gambrel roofs are present. Different types are sometimes combined in
a single structure, and tower roofs, cupolas, lanterns, belvideres, monitors, conical roofs are used
on various Victorian houses. Flat roof areas in the center of hip or mansard roofs are frequent.
Later apartment and commercial buildings generally have flat roofs not visible from the ground.
The generally tall roofs add height to the houses of the Victorian period.

(12)

Walls of continuity. Between Woodward and Brush, the houses originally honored common
setbacks which provided for front lawns. Some of the later apartments have not been set back to
the same line as the houses amongst which they were built, thus disturbing the original line of
continuity. On Woodward, the commercial development is typically at the sidewalk, creating a
wall of continuity; this is not entirely continuous due to parking lots and some buildings set well
back. On John R. and Brush, and east of Brush, buildings are typically placed at or near the
sidewalk with little or no front yard. Where buildings are continuous, a wall of continuity is
created.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The major landscape
feature of the district is the vacant land, which creates a feeling that buildings are missing in the
district. Some houses have more than the standard fifty (50) foot lot, and have wide side yards.
Individual houses have front lawns often subdivided by walks leading to the entrance; lawns are
exceedingly shallow or non-existent in the area between Beaubien and Brush. Side drives are
rare, access to garages or coach houses being from the alleys. The closing of Watson and Edmund
Place between John R. and Brush has created landscaped malls uncharacteristic to the district.
Some walks of stone slabs have survived; others have been replaced in concrete. Sidewalks are
characteristically close to the curb.

 (14)

Relationship of open space to structures. There is a large quantity of open space in the area, due
to demolition of buildings. The character of this open space is haphazard as it relates to buildings,
and indicates the unplanned nature of demolitions due to decline. The feeling created is that
buildings are missing and should be present. On Watson and Edmund between John R. and Brush,
the streets have been removed and replaced with landscaped malls. The traditional relationship
of houses to street has thus become a relationship between houses and landscaped strip open
space.

(15)

Scale of facades and facade elements. In the large houses between John R. and Brush, the scale
tends to be large, and the facade elements scaled and disposed to emphasize the large size of the
houses. Towers, setbacks, porches and the like divide facades into large elements. On
Woodward, the scale ranges from very large, and emphasized by many small window openings,
as in the former Detroiter Hotel, and very large, made up of large architectonic elements, such as
the churches, down to quite small, with large windows emphasizing the small size, as in some
commercial fronts. East of Brush, the scale is smaller and the detail less elaborate, creating a
more intimate setting with the buildings closer to the street. Later apartments are large in scale
with simple but large elements near the ground and repetitive window openings above, frequently
capped by a substantial cornice.

(16)

Directional expression of front facades. A substantial majority of the buildings in the district
have front facades vertically expressed. Exceptions are some commercial buildings on
Woodward, row houses on John R. or Brush, and some duplexes or row houses east of Brush.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Buildings on the north-south streets generally have little or no
setback, while older houses on the east-west streets between Woodward and Brush have some
setback, which varies from street to street, though generally consistent in any one block. Later
apartments and commercial structures in that area often ignore the previously established setback.
Between Brush and Beaubien, setback is generally very limited, only a few feet, if any, lawn
space being provided between sidewalk and building.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverage. Older single family houses between Woodward and Brush generally
occupy about twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) percent of the building lot, not including coach houses
or garages. Later apartments and commercial buildings often fill a much higher percentage of the
lot, sometimes approaching or reaching complete lot coverage. Between Brush and Beaubien, lot
coverage for residential structures is generally about forty (40) percent, with commercial and later
apartment buildings again occupying larger percentage of their lots.

(19)

Degree of complexity with the facades.
The older houses in the district are generally
characterized by a high degree of complexity within the facades, with bay windows, towers,
porches, window and door hoods, elaborate cornices, and other devices used to decorate the
buildings. Newer houses in the northern end of the district and older houses in the southern end
tend to be somewhat simpler than high Victorian structures between them; later apartments and
commercial buildings tend to more classical decorative elements of a simpler kind.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Houses are generally oriented to the east-west streets, while
apartments and commercial structures are more often oriented to the north-south streets. The
construction of the Fisher Freeway has created an artificial public view of the rear yards on
Winder between Woodward and Brush. The vacant land in the area, largely the result of
demolition, creates long-distance views and views of individual buildings from unusual angles
which are foreign to the character of the neighborhood as an intensely developed urban area.

 Garages and coach houses are located in the rear of residential properties, and are generally
oriented to the alley.
(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. In the Victorian structures, examples of both symmetric
and asymmetric design occur; symmetry is more characteristic of the earlier houses, while the
high Victorian examples are more likely to assemble elements in a romantic, asymmetric
composition. Later houses to the north are more often symmetrical, especially when derived from
classical precedent. Asymmetrical but balanced compositions are common. Later apartments are
generally symmetrical.

(22)

General environmental character. The environmental character is of an old urban neighborhood which has
undergone, and is undergoing, considerable change. The original development, reflected in the Victorian
period houses, has been altered by the provision of more intensive residential development in the early
twentieth century, the change in character of Woodward from residential to commercial at about the same
time, and a long period of decline. (Ord. No. 369-H, ' 1, 1-23-80)

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the proposed building design revisions generally conform to the district’s Elements
of Design and the new building will not detract from the district’s historic character. Staff therefore
recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposal because the
design meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation standard number 9) New additions,
exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property.
The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and
architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

However staff recommends that the Commission issue the COA with the following conditions:
• Staff shall have the authority to review and approve any minor revisions to the current design. If
staff determines that any revision does not conform to the spirit of the current approved design, or
does not meet the Standards, staff shall forward the proposed work to the Commission for review
at a hearing.
• Staff shall be given the opportunity to review and approve the final project plans prior to the
issuance of the building permit
• The applicant shall provide a final detailed landscape plan to Planning and Development staff
landscape architects for review and comment. HDC staff shall forward any elements which do not
meet the Standards to the Commission for review at a hearing.

Re: Brush Park CDC Response Letter - 112 Edmund, 2827 John R. and 105 Alfred Project

Brush Park Community Development Corporation (the forwards this letter to provide our
formal response regarding the development project presented with respect to the property located at
112 Edmund, 2827 John R. and 105 Alfred (the ?Project").

The Project has a long history of review before the CDC and the Brush Park community. The
attached E_xnibit A outlines our understanding of the Brush Park Properties, LLC and 112 Edmund, LLC
(collectively, the "Develoger'l community engagement on this project. The latest version of the Project
was presented before the CDC and the Brush Park community at a public meeting held on Tuesday, June
12, 2018 (the "Meeting"). The majority of the community members present at this meeting expressed
concerns and objections to this project. The specific questions and issues raised by the community during
this meeting are summarized on the attached Exhibit 8.

Much consideration was given to the Project by the CDC Board. By a vote of the Board of 1 in
favor, 4 objections and 4 abstentions, the Board has voted to not support this project. The general
consensus of the board is that while there are positive aspects of this project, critical issues that we believe
may have a lasting negative impact on Brush Park remain unresolved. These issues have been previously
communicated to the PC and the Developer, but are restated here for clarity:

BP CDC JUNE 29, 2018

1. Parking. Several Board Members believe that the Developer is using conservative
and outdated parking standards. The total provided is 140 spaces for 39 units commercial/retail
space. Other neighborhood developments within the Greater Downtown area are using more
progressive standards (1 space per unit; often 0 spaces for commercial use), and the DRAFT Form
Based Code suggests more reasonable standards (1 space per unit max.; 1 space per 500
SF commercial max.); however, the developer is using the City of Detroit's generic zoning
standard (rather than one of the City?s more recent standards for transit-oriented
neighborhoods)which leads to excessive parking spaces and induces driving as a mode of
transportation. While recognizing that both residents and retail visitors still need some parking,
3 more reasonable amount might be around 94 total spaces provided (39 residential spaces 55
commercial/retail spaces, using the Draft FBC ratios).

Several Board members feel that the parking deck concern is a derivate or responsible for most
c_?n_ce_mz. inidsniitx- 2V.
reducing the height of the Edmund Building, utilizing the proposed "Commercial space" as
residential to replace the lost ?oors on Edmund--possibly with highly profitable micro-
apartments, many of which would be students that are moving away from vehicles and embracing

the walkable neighborhood concept, you would greatly reduce the amount of parking needed for 

the project, and possibly remove the need for a parking deck. At a minimum, CPC should request
a traffic study to demonstrate the potential impact that the parking deck could have the on the
community and the immediate adjacent neighbors in particular.

The CDC recognizes the need for parking to support developments and that the community is also
generally opposed to additional surface parking lots?. The CDC also acknowledges the Developer's
assertions that they have built the smaller parking deck possible on this parcel. However, we are
concerned about the precedent that this project may set for parking decks within our
neighborhood, particularly as we are conveniently located near sports venues. To start building
parking decks--which in a stadium district is highly profitable--on the east/west streets opens up
the possibility of parking decks "tied to a business" going into every vacant lot in Brush Park.

BP CDC JUNE 29, 2018

2. Curb cuts on Edmund and Alfred. Several board members would prefer to adhere
to the historic precedence of the neighborhood and avoid curb cuts. We recognize that previous
development Crosswinds) have incorporated them, however the curb cuts designed for this
Project aren't intended for residents to park, but for thousands of retail/commercial patrons to
use frequently, diminishing the safety and comfort for pedestrians on the street.

Additionally, some board members are concerned about the use of the alley for parking deck
egress. Residents that use that alley as their only means of parking (since they don?t have curb
cuts) will likely be locked in to their parking spots during high traffic times, and will have to deal
with the additional noise and pollution of those 10005 of vehicles standing and idling next to and
behind their residences.

4. Building Height. We acknowledge that the CDC previously voted to support the 7
story height of the 112 Edmund building, but add that this vote was taken prior to concerns from
owners and residents of the Carlton being brought to the CDC's attention. Several of our board
members continue to express concerns regarding the height of 112 Edmund, irrespective of its
effect on views at the Carlton. Some are concerned that an additional 7 story building may set a
new, undesirable precedent for the neighborhood and whether the height is in the spirit of the

HDC : BRUSH PARK ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
Reference: ​ 112 Edmund Place

Date: May 8, 2019

(1) Height. ​Height varies in the district from one (1) to eleven (11) stories. In the area between Woodward

and Brush, the original development was almost exclusively two and one-half (2 1/2) story houses. Later
changes included the construction of apartment buildings among the houses, the majority of which are
three (3) stories in height. The tallest building, the former Detroiter Hotel, is located on Woodward Avenue
in the commercial strip. All other buildings more than four (4) stories in height are located between
Woodward and John R., and generally on or immediately adjacent to buildings on those streets. East of
Brush, the original development ranged from one (1) to two and one-half (2 1/2) stories. Later
redevelopment includes apartment buildings not more than four (4) stories tall, most often located on
Brush. In the case of the nineteenth century houses located between Woodward and Brush, the two and
one-half (2 1/2) story height implies more height in feet than usual, since ceiling heights in these houses
are unusually high.
112 EDMUND
● On John R Street, story height is five (5) with a four (4) story step down. Ultimate height of
building is 68’ which is lower than the height of the Carlton Lofts (formally Plaza Hotel) building
(92’) on the next block north and the John R Apartments (95’) to the south.
● On Edmund Place, story height is five (5).
● On Alley, story height is four (4).
● Along the historic Lucien Moore Estate, story height is six (5).

(2) Proportion of building's front facade. ​Buildings in the district are usually taller than wide; horizontal
proportions exist only in incompatible later buildings, except for row house buildings.

112 EDMUND
● On John R Street, 112’s side is longer than it is tall. However, grouping of tall windows and
balconies provide a secondary vertical reading.
● 112’s front façade mass on Edmund Place has a vertical read.
● On the Alley, the mass reading is similar to Edmund Place
● Along the historic Lucien Moore Estate, the reading is longer than it is tall. But, like the John R
elevations, grouping of tall windows and balconies soften the horizontal reading.

(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. ​Areas of void generally constitute between fifteen (15)

percent and thirty-five (35) percent of the total facade area, excluding roof. Proportions of the openings
themselves are generally taller than wide; in some cases, vertically proportioned units are combined to fill
an opening wider than tall.

 112 EDMUND
● On John R, as the ground level portion is the retail and residential entry, it is a very ‘open’ facade.
By percentage it is approximate 60% open. Levels two through seven which is a residential
program embody a facade that is approx. 45% open. All window openings are taller than they are
wide.

(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facade. ​Victorian structures in the district often display great
freedom in the placement of openings in the facades, although older examples are generally more regular
in such placement than later examples. In later apartments, openings tend to be very regular.
112 EDMUND
● The window patterning is regular. However balconies are strategically placed in asymmetric
pattern against the regular window grid.

(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. ​The area between Woodward and Brush appears to have

been developed in a very regular spacing, with fifty (50) foot lots. This regularity has been disrupted by the
demolition of many of the houses, and the vacant land resulting, as well as the occasional combination of
lots for larger structures, particularly close to Woodward. East of Brush, smaller lots were used in
subdividing, but many buildings stand on more land than one lot, and the parcel sizes are now quite
irregular, as is the placement of buildings.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, Edmund and the alley, it is one lot and the building essentially occupies the full
frontage with some relief from openings and setbacks.

(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. ​Most buildings have or had a porch or entrance
projection. The variety inherent in Victorian design precludes the establishment of any absolute rhythm,
but such projections were often centered. On Woodward, the commercial nature of most buildings and
the widening of Woodward has effectively eliminated such projections.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, the residential entrance sets back and is centered on the face of the building

(7) Relationship of materials. ​By far the most prevalent material in the district is common brick; other

forms of brick, stone and wood trim are common; wood is used as a structural material only east of Brush.
Some later buildings have stucco wall surfaces. Originally, roofs were wood or slate with an occasional
example of tile; asphalt replacement roofs are common.
112 EDMUND
● The entire building is predominantly brick material with some detailed relief patterning and
openings in screen walls. On John R, a brick base with ornate detailing is provided.

(8) Relationship of textures​. The most common relationship of textures in the district is the low-relief

pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smoother or rougher surfaces of stone or wood trim.
Slate, wood, or tile roofs contribute particular textural values where they exist, especially in the case of

 slates or shingles of other than rectangular shape.
112 EDMUND
● The main field of brick on our building contrasts with the smoother texture of stucco soffits and
storefront glass walls along the street edge.

(9) Relationship of colors. ​Brick red predominates, both in the form of natural color brick and in the form of

painted brick. Other natural brick and stone colors are also present. These relate to painted woodwork in
various colors, and there is an occasional example of stained woodwork. Roofs of other than asphalt are
in natural colors; older slate roofs are often laid in patterns with various colors of slate. Original color
schemes for any given building may be determined by professional analysis of the paint layers on the
building, and when so determined are always appropriate for that building.
112 EDMUND
● The building has a light gray/white color tone in a familiar brick material, meant to compliment in
material but contrast in color some of the neighboring historic homes.

(10) Relationship of architectural detail. ​On the buildings of the Victorian period, elaborate detail in

wood, stone, or sheet metal was common; areas treated include porches, window and door surrounds,
cornices, dormers, and other areas. Later buildings are generally simpler, but include less elaborate detail
in similar areas.
112 EDMUND
● The brick base of 112 will have a raised brick detail (relief) that repeats across all four faces of the
facade and contrasting opening brick screen detail along the base.

(11) Relationship of roof shapes. ​Examples of many roof shapes, including pitched gable roofs, hip roofs,

mansard roofs, and gambrel roofs are present. Different types are sometimes combined in a single
structure, and tower roofs, cupolas, lanterns, belvederes, monitors, conical roofs are used on various
Victorian houses. Flat roof areas in the center of hip or mansard roofs are frequent. Later apartment and
commercial buildings generally have flat roofs not visible from the ground. The generally tall roofs add
height to the houses of the Victorian period.
112 EDMUND
● The new building has a flat roof. However, the parapet is angled in plan giving the appearance
when viewed from street level of an angled or mansard roof shape.

​(12) Walls of continuity. ​Between Woodward and Brush, the houses originally honored common setbacks
which provided for front lawns. Some of the later apartments have not been set back to the same line as
the houses amongst which they were built, thus disturbing the original line of continuity. On Woodward,
the commercial development is typically at the sidewalk, creating a wall of continuity; this is not entirely
continuous due to parking lots and some buildings set well back. On John R. and Brush, and east of Brush,
buildings are typically placed at or near the sidewalk with little or no front yard. Where buildings are
continuous, a wall of continuity is created.
112 EDMUND
● The residential entry is set back off the property line to create a covered entry off the street,
which allows for a wall of continuity which is only broken to represent building entry.

 (13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. ​The major landscape

feature of the district is the vacant land, which creates a feeling that buildings are missing in the district.
Some houses have more than the standard fifty (50) foot lot, and have wide side yards. Individual houses
have front lawns often subdivided by walks leading to the entrance; lawns are exceedingly shallow or
non-existent in the area between Beaubien Street and Brush Street. Side drives are rare, access to garages
or coach houses being from the alleys. The closing of Watson and Edmund Place between John R. and
Brush has created landscaped malls uncharacteristic to the district. Some walks of stone slabs have
survived; others have been replaced in concrete. Sidewalks are characteristically close to the curb.
112 EDMUND
● The new building creates an appropriate urban corner and is set twenty three feet off the side of
Lucien Moore’s closest projection.

(14) Relationship of open space to structures. ​There is a large quantity of open space in the area, due to

demolition of buildings. The character of this open space is haphazard as it relates to buildings, and
indicates the unplanned nature of demolitions due to decline. The feeling created is that buildings are
missing and should be present. On Watson and Edmund between John R. and Brush, the streets have been
removed and replaced with landscaped malls. The traditional relationship of houses to street has thus
become a relationship between houses and landscaped strip open space.
112 EDMUND
● The building fills in a critical, currently vacant urban corner visually stitching together the historic
Lucien Moore Estate to the West with the Carriage House to the South creating Place.
● With a building across the street (currently under construction) at a similar height and scale as
the proposed 112 Edmund, the “vacant” and “missing building” feel at the existing 112 site
would only be amplified without development. The mass of the proposed building relates to the
scale of the existing adjacent structures and this new building as well.

(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. ​In the large houses between John R. and Brush, the scale

tends to be large, and the facade elements scaled and disposed to emphasize the large size of the houses.
Towers, setbacks, porches and the like divide facades into large elements. On Woodward, the scale ranges
from very large, and emphasized by many small window openings, as in the former Detroiter Hotel, and
very large, made up of large architectonic elements, such as the churches, down to quite small, with large
windows emphasizing the small size, as in some commercial fronts. East of Brush, the scale is smaller and
the detail less elaborate, creating a more intimate setting with the buildings closer to the street. Later
apartments are large in scale with simple but large elements near the ground and repetitive window
openings above, frequently capped by a substantial cornice.
112 EDMUND
● The proposed building is in-line with the contextual note that “later apartments are large in scale
with simple but large elements near the ground and repetitive window openings above” The
scale of the facade is slightly smaller scale than the John R apartments to the South and the
Carlton Lofts to the North. The window patterning of the proposed building also relates to these
existing buildings and the regular, simple, alignment of window openings within the facade.

(16) Directional expression of front facades. ​A substantial majority of the buildings in the district have

 front facades vertically expressed. Exceptions are some commercial buildings on Woodward, row houses
on John R. or Brush, and some duplexes or row houses east of Brush.
112 EDMUND
● On John R and along the west property line, the facade is more horizontal with vertical expression
of windows, which break down the scale of the building in the vertical direction.
● On Edmund Place, the building has a more vertical directional expression that relates to homes
along the street. The sloped soffit exacerbates the directional rising-up gesture of the facade.
● On the Alley, the building is slightly wider than, but treated similarly to, the facade on Edmund
Place. An additional element of verticality is created by a subtle material change in the vertical
direction to help break up the building’s width.

(17) Rhythm of building setbacks​. Buildings on the north-south streets generally have little or no setback,

while older houses on the east-west streets between Woodward and Brush have some setback, which
varies from street to street, though generally consistent in any one block. Later apartments and
commercial structures in that area often ignore the previously established setback. Between Brush and
Beaubien, setback is generally very limited, only a few feet, if any, lawn space being provided between
sidewalk and building.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, being a North-South street, the building has no setback at levels 2-6, consistent with
this element of design and other buildings on the John R corridor. The ground level is fronted by
a folded plane of brick and storefront that is setback of 4 - 8 feet to provide more of a pedestrian
space that is shared by tables, chairs and bike racks associated with the retail spaces within the
building.
● On Edmund Place, the building is set back more dramatically at the corner adjacent to the historic
Lucien Moore home.
● Along Historic Home, the building is setback 10 feet from the property line above the ground
level which sits along the edge of the property.

(18) Relationship of lot coverage. ​Older single family houses between Woodward and Brush generally

occupy about twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) percent of the building lot, not including coach houses or
garages. Later apartments and commercial buildings often fill a much higher percentage of the lot,
sometimes approaching or reaching complete lot coverage. Between Brush and Beaubien, lot coverage for
residential structures is generally about forty (40) percent, with commercial and later apartment buildings
again occupying larger percentage of their lots.
112 EDMUND
● 112 will be similar to the later apartments buildings’ lot coverage with the coverage
approximately ninety-percent. The new building holds the street edge along John R with the open
space strategically placed between the new building and the Lucien Moore Estate along the
upper levels to add relief between the two.

(19) Degree of complexity with the facades. ​The older houses in the district are generally characterized

by a high degree of complexity within the facades, with bay windows, towers, porches, window and door
hoods, elaborate cornices, and other devices used to decorate the buildings. Newer houses in the northern
end of the district and older houses in the southern end tend to be somewhat simpler than high Victorian

 structures between them; later apartments and commercial buildings tend to more classical decorative
elements of a simpler kind.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, Edmund Place and the Alley, 112’s facade has a restrained complexity on the upper
portion with a static brick with a simple, but patterned brick walls at the pedestrian’s ground
level that creates both an interesting public zone spatially and visually due to the shadow-play.
The ornamentation offered by the unique brick pattern of the soffit band harkens back to some
of the traditional brickwork found in the neighborhood.
● Along Historic Home, in addition to a similar treatment to the other three facades, a large area of
unadorned brickwork acts as a simple backdrop to The Lucien Moore Estate allowing this great
existing building to be enjoyed without a lot of background visual clutter.
(20) ​Orientation, vistas, overviews.​ ​Houses are generally oriented to the east-west streets, while
apartments and commercial structures are more often oriented to the north-south streets. The construction
of the Fisher Freeway has created an artificial public view of the rear yards on Winder between Woodward
and Brush. The vacant land in the area, largely the result of demolition, creates long-distance views and
views of individual buildings from unusual angles which are foreign to the character of the neighborhood as
an intensely developed urban area. Garages and coach houses are located in the rear of residential
properties, and are generally oriented to the alley.
112 EDMUND
● The broad front facade of the building is oriented toward the main thoroughfare, as are the other
existing apartment buildings of its kind. Windows and balconies are regularly ordered on the
facade and oriented perpendicularly to John R.

(21)Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. ​In the Victorian structures, examples of both symmetric and

asymmetric design occur; symmetry is more characteristic of the earlier houses, while the high Victorian
examples are more likely to assemble elements in a romantic, asymmetric composition. Later houses to
the north are more often symmetrical, especially when derived from classical precedent. Asymmetrical but
balanced compositions are common. Later apartments are generally symmetrical.
112 EDMUND
● On John R, the windows and massing are symmetrical, with select asymmetric formal moves
meant to balance the composition of the facade.
● On Edmund Place, the building is intentionally symmetrical in elevation to mirror the symmetric
reading of the Lucien Moore Estate, but in plan, in similar fashion, asymmetric moves give relief
to the facade.
● On Alley, the base and residential program is symmetric in elevation.
● Along Historic Home, the building is mostly symmetric, especially along the backdrop of the
Lucien Moore Estate, to provide balance.

(22)General environmental character. ​The environmental character is of an old urban neighborhood

which has undergone, and is undergoing, considerable change. The original development, reflected in the
Victorian period houses, has been altered by the provision of more intensive residential development in the
early twentieth century, the change in character of Woodward from residential to commercial at about the
same time and a long period of decline.
●

The proposed building is characteristic of the “considerable change” going on in Brush Park. By

 ●

concealing required parking space behind retail and residential space that will bring life to the
streets, the neighborhood is given the opportunity to evolve from a largely vacant expanse with a
few historic gems into a vibrant urban neighborhood with a dense population of folks who can
enjoy the history that surrounds them.
“The environmental character is of an old urban neighborhood which has undergone, and is
undergoing, considerable change.” Of all the considerations, this, perhaps more than any other has
driven the design of the proposed building. It is that quality of maintaining historic character in the
presence of considerable change that will help Brush Park realize its bright future.

 REPORT

AGENDA

STAFF REPORT 6/13/2018 MEETING
PREPARED BY: J. ROSS
APPLICATION NUMBER 18-5708
ADDRESS: 112 EDMUND PLACE & 2827 JOHN R/105 ALFRED
APPLICANT: AJ RILEY/CARLO LIBURDI
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BRUSH PARK
PROPOSAL
As per the below aerial photo, the proposed project includes three parcels that are located within
the Brush Park Historic District: 112 Edmund, 2827 John R, and 105 Alfred. The parcels at 112
Edmund and 105 Alfred are empty, grassy lots, while 2827 John R. includes an existing historicage building. The building is one story and appears to have been built in three stages. Specifically,
includes a two-story, brick carriage house that was erected ca. 1880, a ca. 1925 brick one-story
shop addition and a ca. 1945 brick and concrete block one-story shop addition. As per the
submitted structural report and photos, the building is in poor condition, as it suffered from a fire.
The project area sits in an area which is dominated by residential uses. An historic-age, 2-1/2
story dwelling, known as the Lucian Moore House, is located to the east of the 112 Edmund
parcel. A paved parking lot and an 8-story apartment building, known as the Carlton, is north of
the 112 Edmund parcel, across Edmund Pl. The historic-age, 2-1/2 story JL Hudson house is west
of the 2827 John R/105 Alfred building.
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking approval for the following:
Erect a new mixed-use, 7-story, 80’-0” tall building with one level of below-grade parking at 112
Edmund as per the submitted plans and renderings and the below description:


The new building will feature brick and metal fins at the first/commercial story. Storefront
windows and doors will be aluminum (dark bronze in color). The second story also
features aluminum storefront windows and built in planters. Upper stories are primarily
clad with cement fiberboard with brick at the west elevation. Balconies with metal mesh
railings are located at stories 4-6, which are the residential stories. The roof is flat. Note
that several gestures have been employed in order to allow for a clear siteline to the
Lucian Moore House, to include the stepping back of the front entrance, the canting of
the west elevation and raised soffit line at stories 2 and 3, and the brick treatment at the
west elevation.

Erect a new three-story addition atop the existing building at 2827 John R. A new 4-story addition
will be erected as well and shall extend into the parcel at 105 Alfred as per the submitted plans
and renderings. Finally, an outdoor patio area will be established to the south of the existing
buildings.


The existing building envelope at 2827 John R. will be retained, cleaned and repaired
where necessary with brick to match the historic appearance. New windows and doors
(material not specified) will be added to the original carriage house. Existing window
openings at the flat–roof portion of the building will be enlarged and new aluminum
upward- folding doors will be installed. The rooftop addition will feature glass curtain

 




wall and insulated wood window, and insulated folding wood door curtain wall systems.
Integral balconies and soffit are projecting and will be clad with zinc panels. Charred,
slatted cedar screens will provide visual interest. Glass panel railing will be located at the
balconies
A one-story mass (exterior material and exterior door and window material not specified)
will be erected to connect the existing, historic building to the new 4-story
garage/residential addition.
The new the new 4-story garage/residential addition will be primarily be clad with glazed
brick. Charred cedar vertical wood panels will be employed to screen the garage openings
at the 4th story, rear, and side elevations. Climbing vines (species not specified) will be
added to the screen. The front elevation, which is located at the residential liner, will
feature aluminum windows and doors. Please do note that the new building’s setback is
inconsistent with the setback of the existing historic building as it steps forward towards
the street well south of the two remaining neighboring historic buildings on the north side
of the street.
As per the attached plan, landscaping (species not identified) will define the parcel’s
southern edges. An 18”-tall planter wall will enclose a concrete and slate patio. A
freestanding projection wall, which will be constructed of 2x8 vertical boards with furred
steel panels will be erected to screen the patio from the garage. Decorative vehicular and
pedestrian pavers will be installed at the walkway and driveway which lead to the
residential/garage side addition.

ADDITIONAL SUBMISSION MATERIALS
The applicant has submitted the attached section drawing, which indicates the system of bracing
they will employ in order to ensure that the construction necessary for the underground parking
will not damage the historic Lucian Moor Home. It is unclear to staff how this bracing will
guarantee that the neighboring historic home will not be damaged by the planned excavations, so
she has requested that the applicant provide an explanation at the 6/13/2018 meeting. Please see
the attached narrative and renderings, which outline the manner in which the applicant feels that
their project’s design complies with the district’s Elements of Design. The applicant has also
supplied an outline of the meetings they have attended around the socialization of their design.
The renderings also note the revisions which the applicants have made in order to accommodate
some concerns voiced by neighboring residents. Finally, please see the attached, which depicts
the historic density within the neighborhood. However, please also see the attached letters which
have been submitted in opposition to the design of the 112 Edmund building. In general, it
appears that the opposition surrounds the height of the building.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS
In regard to 112 Edmund, please see the below Elements of Design for the district which notes
that “Height varies in the district from one (1) to eleven (11) stories. In the area between
Woodward and Brush, the original development was almost exclusively two and one-half (21/2)
story houses…. All other buildings more than four (4) stories in height are located between
Woodward and John R., and generally on or immediately adjacent to buildings on those
streets.” Also, the applicant has made a number of gestures towards mitigating the height of 112
Edmund in relation to the historic 2 1/2-story Lucien Moore Mansion. Based upon these factor,
in addition to the proposed materiality, form, and massing, staff feels the proposed building

 design meets Elements of Design and the Standards.
In regard to the proposal for the 2827 John R/105 Alfred building, it is staff’s opinion that the
existing building does contribute to the district’s historic fabric. Typically, the Standards do not
allow for the addition of such a large mass to the rooftop of an existing contributing historic
building. However, please note that he applicant has provided ample evidence that the building
is in poor structural condition and, as per the submitted structural report, is in danger of collapse
if exposed to an extreme wind event. For this reason, staff feels that a review of this portion of
the project via the Notice to Proceed is appropriate under the following condition:
(1). The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or the occupants
To reiterate, the applicant is not seeking to demolish this deteriorated building, rather, they
propose to retain and incorporate this building into the new construction.
Finally, the side addition/garage does appear to conform to the district’s character in terms of
massing, materiality, and height. However, as noted above, it does not conform to the prevailing
setback along this block of Alfred Street. It is recognized that the building is mixed-use and is
not a traditional detached single-family home with a front and back yard.
APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1)

Height. Height varies in the district from one (1) to eleven (11) stories. In the area between
Woodward and Brush, the original development was almost exclusively two and one-half (21/2)
story houses. Later changes included the construction of apartment buildings among the houses,
the majority of which are three (3) stories in height. The tallest building, the former Detroiter
Hotel, is located on Woodward Avenue in the commercial strip. All other buildings more than
four (4) stories in height are located between Woodward and John R., and generally on or
immediately adjacent to buildings on those streets. East of Brush, the original development
ranged from one (1) to two and one-half (21/2) stories. Later redevelopment includes apartment
buildings not more than four (4) stories tall, most often located on Brush. In the case of the
nineteenth century houses located between Woodward and Brush, the two and one-half (21/2)
story height implies more height in feet than usual, since ceiling heights in these houses are
unusually high.

(2)

Proportion of building's front facade. Buildings in the district are usually taller than wide;
horizontal proportions exist only in incompatible later buildings, except for row house buildings.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the facade. Areas of void generally constitute between fifteen (15)
percent and thirty-five (35) percent of the total facade area, excluding roof. Proportions of the
openings themselves are generally taller than wide; in some cases, vertically proportioned units
are combined to fill an opening wider than tall.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facade. Victorian structures in the district often display great
freedom in the placement of openings in the facades, although older examples are generally more
regular in such placement than later examples. In later apartments, openings tend to be very
regular.

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The area between Woodward and Brush appears to
have been developed in a very regular spacing, with fifty (50) foot lots. This regularity has been
disrupted by the demolition of many of the houses, and the vacant land resulting, as well as the

 occasional combination of lots for larger structures, particularly close to Woodward. East of
Brush, smaller lots were used in subdividing, but many buildings stand on more land than one lot,
and the parcel sizes are now quite irregular, as is the placement of buildings.
(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Most buildings have or had a porch or entrance
projection. The variety inherent in Victorian design precludes the establishment of any absolute
rhythm, but such projections were often centered. On Woodward, the commercial nature of most
buildings and the widening of Woodward has effectively eliminated such projections.

(7)

Relationship of materials. By far the most prevalent material in the district is common brick;
other forms of brick, stone and wood trim are common; wood is used as a structural material only
east of Brush. Some later buildings have stucco wall surfaces. Originally, roofs were wood or
slate with an occasional example of tile; asphalt replacement roofs are common.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is the lowrelief pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smoother or rougher surfaces of stone or
wood trim. Slate, wood, or tile roofs contribute particular textural values where they exist,
especially in the case of slates or shingles of other than rectangular shape.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Brick red predominates, both in the form of natural color brick and in the
form of painted brick. Other natural brick and stone colors are also present. These relate to
painted woodwork in various colors, and there is an occasional example of stained woodwork.
Roofs of other than asphalt are in natural colors; older slate roofs are often laid in patterns with
various colors of slate. Original color schemes for any given building may be determined by
professional analysis of the paint layers on the building, and when so determined are always
appropriate for that building.

(10)

Relationship of architectural detail. On the buildings of the Victorian period, elaborate detail in
wood, stone, or sheet metal was common; areas treated include porches, window and door
surrounds, cornices, dormers, and other areas. Later buildings are generally simpler, but include
less elaborate detail in similar areas.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. Examples of many roof shapes, including pitched gable roofs, hip
roofs, mansard roofs, and gambrel roofs are present. Different types are sometimes combined in
a single structure, and tower roofs, cupolas, lanterns, belvideres, monitors, conical roofs are used
on various Victorian houses. Flat roof areas in the center of hip or mansard roofs are frequent.
Later apartment and commercial buildings generally have flat roofs not visible from the ground.
The generally tall roofs add height to the houses of the Victorian period.

(12)

Walls of continuity. Between Woodward and Brush, the houses originally honored common
setbacks which provided for front lawns. Some of the later apartments have not been set back to
the same line as the houses amongst which they were built, thus disturbing the original line of
continuity. On Woodward, the commercial development is typically at the sidewalk, creating a
wall of continuity; this is not entirely continuous due to parking lots and some buildings set well
back. On John R. and Brush, and east of Brush, buildings are typically placed at or near the
sidewalk with little or no front yard. Where buildings are continuous, a wall of continuity is
created.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The major landscape
feature of the district is the vacant land, which creates a feeling that buildings are missing in the
district. Some houses have more than the standard fifty (50) foot lot, and have wide side yards.

 Individual houses have front lawns often subdivided by walks leading to the entrance; lawns are
exceedingly shallow or non-existent in the area between Beaubien and Brush. Side drives are
rare, access to garages or coach houses being from the alleys. The closing of Watson and Edmund
Place between John R. and Brush has created landscaped malls uncharacteristic to the district.
Some walks of stone slabs have survived; others have been replaced in concrete. Sidewalks are
characteristically close to the curb.
(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. There is a large quantity of open space in the area, due
to demolition of buildings. The character of this open space is haphazard as it relates to buildings,
and indicates the unplanned nature of demolitions due to decline. The feeling created is that
buildings are missing and should be present. On Watson and Edmund between John R. and Brush,
the streets have been removed and replaced with landscaped malls. The traditional relationship
of houses to street has thus become a relationship between houses and landscaped strip open
space.

(15)

Scale of facades and facade elements. In the large houses between John R. and Brush, the scale
tends to be large, and the facade elements scaled and disposed to emphasize the large size of the
houses. Towers, setbacks, porches and the like divide facades into large elements. On
Woodward, the scale ranges from very large, and emphasized by many small window openings,
as in the former Detroiter Hotel, and very large, made up of large architectonic elements, such as
the churches, down to quite small, with large windows emphasizing the small size, as in some
commercial fronts. East of Brush, the scale is smaller and the detail less elaborate, creating a
more intimate setting with the buildings closer to the street. Later apartments are large in scale
with simple but large elements near the ground and repetitive window openings above, frequently
capped by a substantial cornice.

(16)

Directional expression of front facades. A substantial majority of the buildings in the district
have front facades vertically expressed. Exceptions are some commercial buildings on
Woodward, row houses on John R. or Brush, and some duplexes or row houses east of Brush.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Buildings on the north-south streets generally have little or no
setback, while older houses on the east-west streets between Woodward and Brush have some
setback, which varies from street to street, though generally consistent in any one block. Later
apartments and commercial structures in that area often ignore the previously established setback.
Between Brush and Beaubien, setback is generally very limited, only a few feet, if any, lawn
space being provided between sidewalk and building.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverage. Older single family houses between Woodward and Brush generally
occupy about twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) percent of the building lot, not including coach houses
or garages. Later apartments and commercial buildings often fill a much higher percentage of the
lot, sometimes approaching or reaching complete lot coverage. Between Brush and Beaubien, lot
coverage for residential structures is generally about forty (40) percent, with commercial and later
apartment buildings again occupying larger percentage of their lots.

(19)

Degree of complexity with the facades.
The older houses in the district are generally
characterized by a high degree of complexity within the facades, with bay windows, towers,
porches, window and door hoods, elaborate cornices, and other devices used to decorate the
buildings. Newer houses in the northern end of the district and older houses in the southern end
tend to be somewhat simpler than high Victorian structures between them; later apartments and
commercial buildings tend to more classical decorative elements of a simpler kind.

 (20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Houses are generally oriented to the east-west streets, while
apartments and commercial structures are more often oriented to the north-south streets. The
construction of the Fisher Freeway has created an artificial public view of the rear yards on
Winder between Woodward and Brush. The vacant land in the area, largely the result of
demolition, creates long-distance views and views of individual buildings from unusual angles
which are foreign to the character of the neighborhood as an intensely developed urban area.
Garages and coach houses are located in the rear of residential properties, and are generally
oriented to the alley.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. In the Victorian structures, examples of both symmetric
and asymmetric design occur; symmetry is more characteristic of the earlier houses, while the
high Victorian examples are more likely to assemble elements in a romantic, asymmetric
composition. Later houses to the north are more often symmetrical, especially when derived from
classical precedent. Asymmetrical but balanced compositions are common. Later apartments are
generally symmetrical.

(22)

General environmental character. The environmental character is of an old urban neighborhood which has
undergone, and is undergoing, considerable change. The original development, reflected in the Victorian
period houses, has been altered by the provision of more intensive residential development in the early
twentieth century, the change in character of Woodward from residential to commercial at about the same
time, and a long period of decline. (Ord. No. 369-H, ' 1, 1-23-80)

RECOMMENDATION
As noted above, it is staff’s opinion that the 112 Edmund building design and the addition proposed for
the garage (sited at 105 Alfred) generally conform to the district’s Elements of Design. Staff therefore
recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposal because the
design meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation standard number 9) New additions,
exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property.
The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and
architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

However staff recommends that the Commission issue the COA with the following conditions:
 Staff shall have the authority to review and approve any minor revisions to the current design. If
staff determines that any revision does not conform to the spirit of the current approved design, or
does not meet the standards, staff shall forward the proposed work to the Commission for review
at a hearing.
 Staff shall be given the opportunity to review and approve the final project plans prior to the
issuance of the building permit
 The applicant shall provide a final detailed landscape plan to Planning and Development staff
landscape architects for review and comment. HDC staff shall forward any elements which do not
meet the standards to the Commission for review at a hearing.
In regard to the rooftop additions proposed for 2827 John R. please note that staff does not proffer
recommendations for the Notice to Proceed/work which does not meet the Standards. Staff therefore
withholds rendering a recommendation regarding the approval of this portion of the proposals.
