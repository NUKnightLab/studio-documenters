provided by an outside contractor in-house; and to relieve additional workload from the local pharmacies
in order to decrease the turnaround time for patients waiting onsite for prescriptions. The precedent for
this salary was set by the CORE Center pharmacy manager, a CCHHS employee whose salary is
$134,500. The candidate is highly qualified with 24 years of experience. He has managed the mail order
pharmacy for the company currently under contract to provide services to our patients. The anticipated
savings to CCHHS for bringing these services in-house is approximately $3 million annually. Available
Market Data indicates a median salary for a position of this type at $124,301.00.

ITEM #19

Transmitting a Communication, dated December 2, 2010 from

requesting approval of payment in the amount of $164,000.00 to Anchor Mechanical, Inc., Chicago,
Illinois, for the rental and installation of an Emergency Temporary Boiler at the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center-West Addition.
Reason:

This was a one time purchase in which the vendor chosen was the successful bidder for the
system described above. Anchor Mechanical, Inc., sought various boiler rental companies
and found only two boilers immediately available. An Emergency Temporary Boiler was
rented until a boiler purchased by the County could arrive and be installed.
Under normal conditions the building had three operating boilers. However, two boilers were
not functional, one boiler cannot maintain adequate building temperature. Had that boiler
failed we would have had to close the facility.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $164,000.00.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY MULTI-FAMILY PRESERVATION INITIATIVE (SCCMPI)
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section
6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook receives funding through the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) for the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) Program, the purpose of
which is to provide financing and funding for affordable housing in jurisdictions participating in Cook
County’s HOME Consortium; and
WHEREAS, the Preservation Compact is an initiative formed by the MacArthur Foundation, the Urban

Initiative – along with five other public housing agencies, the Illinois Housing Development Authority

housing that advances the Housing Endorsement Criteria of the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus; and

insufficient to meet demand, and that it is likely that for every new affordable apartment unit built or

WHEREAS, the Bureau of Community Development and the Office of the President have worked with
the Preservation Compact to develop programs to begin to address the increasing scarcity of such housing
in suburban Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the preservation of rental housing is a permissible use of HOME funds; and
WHEREAS, in partnership with the Preservation Compact and its partner organizations, the
Metropolitan Mayors Caucus, the Metropolitan Planning Council, and the Regional Housing Initiative,

WHEREAS, the Board recognizes the important work of the Preservation Compact and its partner
organizations, and its efforts of collaboration to preserve affordable multi-family rental housing.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
The foregoing recitals are incorporated herein as findings of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County, Illinois.
The Board hereby approves of the County’s involvement in the partnership of the SCCMPI - a new
initiative to provide low-cost gap financing to developers for the following purposes;
To encourage the rehabilitation and preservation of quality multi-family rental housing throughout
eligible portions of suburban Cook County;
To improve multi-family rental housing stock in suburban Cook County;
To support multi-family rental housing rehabilitation in job growth corridors to increase access to jobs
and transit;
To support revitalization efforts in more affordable areas lacking jobs and other amenities;
To encourage collaboration with municipalities working on local workforce housing issues;
To leverage additional housing resources for suburban Cook County;
To provide financial assistance to rehabilitate multi-family foreclosed rental properties that are currently
de-stabilizing neighborhoods and reducing state and local revenues.
The Bureau of Community Development will work with the Metropolitan Planning Council, as
administrator of the Rental Housing Initiative, and the Preservation Compact to review applications and
select projects for funding.
The Board hereby authorizes the Bureau Chief of the Bureau of Community Development, or his
designee, to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to further this
Initiative for the execution of the HOME-specific recommended projects and funding amounts to be
individually presented to the Board for separate approval.

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
CONTRACT
ITEM #32
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 15, 2010 from
JOSEPH BERRIOS, Cook County Assessor
by
CHRISTINA VILLARREAL, Legislative Liaison
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc. Chicago, Illinois, for publication of the state mandated publications as follows: proposed
assessed values for the 2011 real estate triennial assessment of the South Townships outside the city of
Chicago; revisions made to the 2011 triennial assessment in South Townships outside the city of Chicago,
after publication of the initial triennial assessment publication; 2011 triennial assessment list in additional
newspapers for additional public notification as directed by the Assessor's Office; revisions made to the
2011 real estate non-triennial assessment of North Townships outside the city of Chicago; and revisions
made as a consequence of the change in assessment practices to the 2010 real estate assessment of North
townships outside the city of Chicago.
Reason:

Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. has been the sole-source vendor for the publication of
Cook County's suburban townships assessment list since 2002. Prior to 2002, this same
entity published the assessment list for many years. During this time, prior to 2002, Cook
County Suburban Publishers, Inc. was the only vendor to submit a response when the annual
contract was sent out to bid. State statutes (35ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 et seq.)
impose strict guidelines as to who may publish the assessment list for Cook County's
suburban townships. Therefore, due to the timely nature of publishing the assessment list, the
Assessor's Office requests that this contract be sole-sourced to Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $597,441.28. Contract period: May 1, 2011 through April 30, 2012. (040-240
Account). Requisition No. 10400003.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2011 funds.
