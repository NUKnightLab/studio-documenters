III. Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, provided additional information regarding request number 4; this
was a request to amend and increase the contract with Ungaretti & Harris for services relating to the Medicaid
1115 Waiver Project. She indicated that activities regarding the Waiver Project began very quickly; staff was
asked to start working on a multitude of projects within a very short period of time. Staff was given several
recommendations for outside counsel for these purposes; Ungaretti & Harris was one of the firms
recommended. At that time, it was anticipated that the cost for these services would be less than $150,000;
however, the work became exponentially greater than anticipated. The vendor was involved in activities such
as drafting provider agreements, manuals, third party administrator contracts, pharmacy benefit manager
contracts; they also provided expertise in Federal law regarding the Medicaid Waiver – the System did not
have in-house experience on these matters. The administration moved quickly on this, and the selection of the
vendor was by recommendation. For future needs, Ms. Reidy noted that the administration is considering
moving forward to put out a general Request for Proposals (RFP) for legal services, having several firms
respond, and having a pool of attorneys that the System is able to call upon when needed.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 10. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

A. Committee Education Item – Procurement (Attachment #2)
Ms. Besenhofer provided an overview of the Procurement Code and Enabling Ordinance. The Committee

Besenhofer stated that, at another point in time, she will take a few minutes to explain the value analysis process
– what it is, and how the Supply Chain staff works with the clinicians and physicians to standardize by looking
at utilization and utilization patterns.
The Committee received and filed the information without objection.

B. Update on the following projects:

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on the following projects:
i.

Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (continued)
Mr. Glass stated that that, effective January 1st, the System will transition the Waiver Project into what is a
managed care community network (MCCN); the administration has discussed this with the State’s
Department of Healthcare and Family Services, and has reported to this Board on the subject. The Waiver
that was granted to the State expires on December 31st, but plans are in place for the System to become that
MCCN entity on January 1st. It will be a seamless transition to the members, as well as to those partners in
the network. There will be no gap in delivery of care, and no gap in coverage for the member.
Mr. Glass indicated that all reported data contained in this update are as of 8/31/2013 except where noted.
Nearly 97,000 CountyCare applications have been initiated – this is an increase of almost 9,000 from the
number reported to the Committee last month.
The majority of applications (52%) continue to be initiated through the call center, the on-campus
application assistors and other program vendors. 44% have been initiated from the CountyCare network
partners, and the remaining 4% have been initiated from work within Cermak Health Services of the Cook
County Department of Corrections.
Almost 67,000 applications have been submitted to the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) for
processing. The approval rate for the month was 84%.
An average of 500 applications continues to be submitted to DHS per day; the State is processing an
average of approximately 425 applications per day. The total backlog of applications at the month’s end
was just over 28,000.
Mr. Glass stated that, at the last Committee meeting, two requests for information were made of the
Managed Care Department. Director Gugenheim asked staff to look at member and service distribution
across the County to determine what, if any, gaps in care exist. Board Chairman Carvalho inquired
regarding the reasons applications are being denied.
Specific to mapping, Mr. Glass stated that resources have been secured for geo-mapping from the County;
staff is actively working to have this information to Directors sometime in October.
Regarding denials, Mr. Glass stated that staff have had the opportunity look into this and have identified
the following top five reasons for denial:






applicant was over the income eligibility limit at time of verification;
applicant failed to provide appropriate verification in response to a DHS request;
applicant was eligible for another state program;
application was a duplicate submission; and
applicant did not meet citizenship criteria for eligibility.

Director Wiese inquired regarding the documentation requirements for citizenship verification for the
application. Mr. Glass responded that he can provide this information to her at a later date1.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on the following projects:
i.

Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (continued)
Mr. Oder mentioned the need to transition these reports to have more financial data, including calculations
of per-member per-month (PMPM) costs and revenue, and including data on incurred but not received
(IBNR) claims. It was agreed that this reporting format is essential to have as the System transitions to the
MCCN structure; it was noted that IBNR is currently included in the System’s calculations.
The Committee received and filed the information without objection.

ii. Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) contract management / electronic exchange system
Ms. Besenhofer presented her update on the GHX system. She stated that Phase 2 go-live took place in
June. This incorporated the items for the Operating Room/Sterile Processing into the item master, which
now contains approximately 38,000 items. There is now system integration to assist in the management of
inventory within Sterile Processing and the Operating Room. Staff continues to work on item cost data, as
well as applicable charge capture data. They are building history to use for spend analytics, price
benchmarking and to develop key performance indicators. They continue to roll out the utilization of online requisition capabilities. The Sterile Processing and Operating Room staff will be trained within the
next thirty days. This will continue to help reduce on-hand inventory within the departments.
Staff continues to work through acceptable procedures and appropriate documentation for payment of
invoices. They continue to identify possible alternatives to work flow changes and options to streamline
the paperwork while meeting everyone's needs.
The Committee received and filed the information without objection.
V.

more accurately select diagnosis and procedure codes for claims submission. It does this by providing electronic

record documentation with a natural language processor. Based on this review, it will identify diagnosis and
procedure codes. The coding staff will then validate these code selections. This tool has the potential to increase
coder productivity and improve quality through more consistent code selection.
