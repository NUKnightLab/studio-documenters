among vendors; asked how much of a margin in pricing among resellers is there; asked if the pricing would
be lower if the purchase could have been made directly from Cisco rather than a reseller; and requested

and accurate benefit approvals, reduce procedural errors, and build regional and national partnerships by sharing
successful strategies and best practices. As we implement program changes to meet the demand for nutritional
assistance, the upcoming Midwest Partners event will provide valuable tools to help agencies manage workload.
With ongoing budget challenges, it is essential that State and Local agencies use technology and other management
tools to continue high benefit accuracy and excellent service. This Midwest Partners event is timely in that the
workshops will help agencies provide a forum to recognize the excellent work currently happening in the Midwest
and to share best practices.
