 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of Chicago Housing Authority’s (CHA) commitment to the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD), and under CHA’s application for American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Competitive Grant Stimulus funding, the CHA solicited bids for
consulting/engineering firms to perform “Green Assessments” of sixty-three (63) development
properties, including Senior and Family housing units. This work scope is to be completed within
one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
The Green Assessment will result in:
• Review energy efficiency and green investments at each property.
• A Green Operations and Management Practices (O&M) Manual for CHA’s private
management firms to adhere to
• Training of the CHA staff and property managers on the implementation of the Practices
Manual.
• A Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) assessment score estimate
for each property based on current criteria as defined by the United States Green
Building Council (USGBC).
The term “green” as applied to the above is defined by the Enterprise Green Communities
Criteria (EGCC), published by the Enterprise Green Community Partners. The CHA solicited
proposals for a consultant(s) to assist the Authority in evaluating the current “green” and energy
efficiency status of its properties and making recommendations to improve the efficiency and
environmental performance of sixty-three (63) CHA owned and operated residential facilities.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Request for Proposals (RFP) No. 10-00494 on March 22, 2010 for the
green assessment of sixty-three (63) CHA development properties, including Senior and Family
Housing units, The RFP was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender and
Extra, and on the CHA and BuySpeed Online websites.
The evaluation was a two-step process; the first step was to evaluate and rank the written
proposals. Following those rankings, a minimum score threshold was established to determine
the finalists who would be invited to orally present their proposals to the evaluation committee.
The Pre-bid meeting was held on March 26, 2010. The CHA issued Addendum No. 1 on April 2,
2010.
The CHA received and opened four (4) bids on April 9, 2010 at 11:00 am. Of these four
responses, three (3) firms received scores that were determined to be in the competitive range and
those firms were invited to participate in the oral interview process.

 Oral interviews were held on May 3rd and May 5th 2010. Each firm responded to questions on the
thoroughness of its bid and its capacity to perform this work. The oral interviews were scored by
the evaluation committee, and the firms were later sent “Best and Final” offer letters by the
Department of Procurement and Contracts. Based on the results of the totaled scores, the
recommended firm is HOK/Siemens, with a “Best and Final” offer price of $786,600.00,
representing a $71,000.00 reduction of the price originally submitted in their bid response.
Based on their submitted bid, the Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that
HOK/Siemens is the most qualified and cost-effective firm to perform this work scope.
Based on the forgoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with HOK/Siemens in
the amount of $786,600.00 for the green assessment of sixty-three (63) Senior and Family
development properties. It is to be completed within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of
the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section
3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
