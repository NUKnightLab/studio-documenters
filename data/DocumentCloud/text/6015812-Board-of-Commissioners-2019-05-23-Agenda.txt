BOARD AGENDA

May 23, 2019

Summary: The Bureau of Technology requests authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to
exercise the first of two (2) one-year renewal options and increase the not-to-exceed amount for the
contract with Grant Thornton LLP to provide independent verification and validation (IV&V) services for
the County’s ongoing Integrated Property Tax and Mass Appraisal System implementation.

This amendment also adds scope to the agreement to provide services related to deliverable review, more
robust status reviews, and analytical support for the Assessor’s Office. The Bureau of Technology
believes this scope is necessary to ensure the successful delivery of Assessor’s Office-related
deliverables in the Integrated Property Tax and Mass Appraisal System project.
This contract was approved as a Comparable Government Procurement pursuant to Section 34-140 of the
Cook County Procurement Code. Grant Thornton LLP, was previously awarded a contract by Maricopa
County, Arizona through a Request for Proposals (RFP) process.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Cook County Assessor’s Office
Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: For the purpose of purchasing call center technology for the office.
From Account(s): 11000.1040.13945.520270, $160,000.00
To Account(s): 11000.1040.13945.531690, $160,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $160,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date,
and what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

It became apparent on 4/11/2019 that the account would require additional funds. The balance in the
account was $273,898.80, but that balance has obligations designated to it for the remainder of FY2019.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

Page 49 of 67

List any other

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

May 23, 2019

The account used for the source of the transferred funds was identified as having enough funds to
accommodate the postage needs of the office for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result
in the account that funds are transferred from.

None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was
originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in
the fiscal year.

The prior CCAO administration estimated the postage needs for the office for 2019. We have revised our
postage needs for the year based on changes made to the volume of mailings done for 2019, as well as the
need for the funds to cover a vital project key to the new assessor’s operational priorities.

funds will be used for program staff salaries and fringe benefits ($55,473.00), treatment services
($181,803.00), computer equipment ($9,744.00) and Cook County indirect costs ($8,399.00).
The court’s goal is to increase the number and percentage of participants who achieve stable recovery
and graduate successfully from the programs. To achieve this goal, the court has expanded and expedited
client access to community-based residential substance abuse treatments, incorporated new offender
service elements, such as cognitive behavioral therapies and medication treatments, and expanded trauma
support services.
The Circuit Court of Cook County established the RAP Drug Court Program for men in 1998 and the
WRAP program in 2001 to divert individuals with substance use disorders into treatment. The
RAP/WRAP Drug Court Program is currently one of the largest drug courts in Illinois, with approximately
200 participants supervised each year.
