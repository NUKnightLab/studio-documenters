Recommendations, Information/Discussion Items
A. Report from the Cook County Department of Public Health
i. Update – Partnerships to Improve Community Health (PICH) Program (Attachment #1)
ii. Report - Emergency Preparedness and Response (Attachment #2)
The following individuals from the Cook County Department of Public Health reviewed the materials
presented: Dr. Terry Mason, Chief Operating Officer; Steven Seweryn, Deputy Director of Public Health
Programs; Gina Massuda Barnett, Director of Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; and LaToya
DuBose, Director of Emergency Preparedness and Response.
During the discussion of the PICH Program, it was noted that this is the last year of the three (3) year funding
for the grant, as the grant ends in September 2017. Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the
possibility of getting an extension or additional grant dollars. Mr. Seweryn stated that, in fact, the third year of
the grant was not funded through Congress, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was
permitted to use internal budgetary funds to support 90% of the awards for the grantees across the country. At
the end of 2017, from a federal perspective, those funds are gone and probably will not be made available again.
He noted that CCDPH leads a group of community health advocates, the Alliance for Healthy and Active
Communities; CCDPH will continue to work with them in the period following the grant to try to sustain the
work by developing a sustainability plan and using that as a catalyst to seek additional funding beyond the grant
period. Director Richardson-Lowry suggested that CCDPH look at potential granting capabilities at the federal
level. Additionally, she asked for the approximate amount of dollars needed to sustain this program after
September 2017. Dr. Mason responded that he will provide that information and follow up with Director
Richardson-Lowry. Director Gugenheim strongly recommended that CCDPH look to the private sector for
potential funding opportunities; given that CCDPH will have quite strong evaluation data, the administration
should go to W.K. Kellogg Foundation or the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with a kind of expanded
agenda.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Driscoll, moved to accept the update on the
Partnerships to Improve Community Health Program and the report on Emergency
Preparedness and Response from the Cook County Department of Public Health. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Board and Committee Reports
B. Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting (continued)
Director Gugenheim presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the metrics with Dr. Krishna Das, Chief
Quality Officer. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the metrics regarding Operating Room (OR) efficiency/surgery start time, Director
Richardson-Lowry noted that this is an area in which CCHHS continues to struggle. She referenced a recent
request for a comparative analysis of CCHHS start times versus other hospitals’ start times. She stated that, once
the Board gets past the deep dive on patient experience, she thinks that a little time should be allocated to have a
robust discussion on OR efficiency/surgery start time.
Action was taken on this item following the adjournment of the closed meeting.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of September 20, 2016. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Managed Care Committee Meeting, September 22, 2016
i. Metrics (Attachment #4)
ii. Meeting Minutes
Director Lerner presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the metrics with Steven Glass, Executive Director
of Managed Care. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the review of the metrics, Chairman Hammock remarked that there are two different methodologies being
used to report the performance to budget - in some cases it is actual as a percentage of the budget, and in the
utilization columns, it is the difference between the actual and budget. He requested that one consistent
methodology be used.
It was noted that Valence representatives are expected to appear before the Managed Care Committee in
November to discuss the recent merger of their company with Evolent Health and to get their assurances on their
commitment to this organization. Chairman Hammock suggested that Committee members come up with some
questions for the Valence representatives in advance of the meeting.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Junge, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Managed Care Committee Meeting of September 22, 2016. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

referred to slide 6); he suggested that perhaps the information can be broken down between two (2) slides.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Driscoll, moved the approval of the

Leticia Reyes-Nash, Director of Programmatic Services and Innovation, reviewed a presentation (included in the
September 23, 2016 Finance Committee Meeting Minutes) regarding the Cook County Assisted Outpatient
Treatment Program and related Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) grant;
the request to accept the grant and execute grant-funded contracts relating to that subject are included in the
Contracts and Procurement Items within the Finance Committee Meeting Minutes as request numbers 1 through
6. Charles Jones, Director of Strategic Sourcing and Supply Chain Management, reviewed the remaining
contractual requests that were considered at the Finance Committee Meeting. It was noted that request number
16, a proposed contract with U.S. Foods, Inc., remains pending review by Contract Compliance.
Chairman Hammock requested for the next Board Meeting that Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, walk
the Board through where CCHHS will end up at the end of the fiscal year, based on the administration’s estimates.
Mr. Elwell responded that projections through year end will be presented.

Approximately one in three CCH HS patients are uninsured.

A coordinated health program will provide eligible residents with a membership card, member handbook and an
assigned ?medical home,? at one community health centers where they can receive consistent
primary and specialty care at any facility, and care coordination. The program is intended to improve the
individual health status of these patients by linking them to primary care to avoid preventable and expensive

On September 20, 2016, CountyCa re hosted its FY17 Quarter CountyCare Enrollee Advisory Committee
Meeting at the offices of PLCCA (Proviso Leyden Council for Community Action) in Maywood. The CountyCare
members in attendance mainly live in the western suburbs of Cook County including the cities of Maywood,
Elmwood Park and Berwyn. All of the attendees were African American and most of them were women ages 60?
65. Due to their age, a discussion of Medicare health plan issues arose as many of them would like to continue
with CountyCare once they turn 65. Two members were very pleased with the services provided by Community
Nurse Health Center in La Grange. In addition, we had members who go to PCC Wellness, Fantus, Stroger
Specialty Care Center and Austin. Most of the members also mentioned that they would like a health center
closer to the Maywood community. A few of them who receive specialty care at Loyola mentioned that they
would have to look for alternate doctors as Loyola is no longer in network.

in terms of health, most of the members felt healthy after entering the plan. They like the ability to go to
doctors and improve their health. The members shared their individual stories with the group. One member's
story demonstrates the value of the visiting her doctor, she lost over 75 pounds and now controls
her type 2 diabetes. This member didn?t have insurance in the past and used to obtain care through Access to
Care. She?s happy now that she has a choice and a plan that cares for her.

STRATEGIC
PLANNING

 

The Cook County Board of Commissioners met
today and considered a number of 
matters, including three directly related to our new
strategic plan.

Our strategic plan, IMPACT 2020, was formally
introduced today to the County Board and referred
to the Cook County Health and Hospital Committee
for discussion and approval. We anticipate that
meeting to occur in early October.

Early this morning, we participated in a press
conference with President Preckwinkle and
Commissioners Gainer, Steele and Garcia to
announce the creation of a coordinated health
program or direct access program as contemplated
in the strategic plan. A coordinated health program
wili provide eligible residents with a membership
card, member handbook and an assigned ?medical
home," at one of community health centers
where they can receive consistent primary and
specialty care at any facility, and care
coordination. The program is intended to improve
the individual health status of these patients by
linking them to primary care to avoid preventable
and expensive emergency and inpatient care.

All Cook County residents who earn up to 200% of
the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and are not
otherwise eligible for public insurance will be eligible
for the program, including many of our 40,000
CareLink patients. is developing an
operational structure for the coordinated health
program as well as a transition plan for current
CareLink members and other eligible patients to
enter into the new program beginning in early 2017.

Successful coordinated health programs for the
uninsured have been established in many
metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, San
Francisco, and Washington DC.

As part of the budget process, we submitted our
proposed preliminary budget for 2017 to the County
Board today for incorporation into President
Preckwinkle's 20i 7 budget. President Preckwinkle?s
budget will be introduced and subsequently acted
upon before the beginning of the new fiscal year,
December 15*.

As we outlined in the budget fact sheet that was
distributed on August l9lh, our budget is down 3%
from 6 yet contemplates a growth strategy
with higher patient volumes in primary and specialty
care, surgical procedures and births and places
continued emphasis on quality and the patient
experience.

Unfortunately, we have finite resources to
accomplish our goals, requiring us to make difficult
decisions to ensure we can stay true to our mission
and compete in the new health care environment.
Remembering that our underlying goal is to continue
our transformation into a modern patient?centered
health system, we will be adding new positions in
some areas and eliminating positions in other areas.
When all is said and done, we expect our full-time
position count will increase by more than 100
positions. In the coming weeks, more information will
be made available and we will, as always, work
closely with our labor partners to make these
transitions with the least disruption possible.

The County Board also approved a resolution calling
for the creation of a gun violence research
consortium guided by clinical and public health
experts of the system, including the Collaborative
Research Unit (CRU). The CRU was created in l998 to
promote research on issues impacting the health of
vulnerable and diverse patient populations. We are
seeing first-hand the impact of violence in our
communities and took forward to contributing to
understanding of the impact of this scourge on the
communities we serve.

In other news, I am pleased to report that on
Tuesday, the Illinois Health Facilities Services Review
Board approved the Certificate of Need for the
construction of the new Central Campus Health
Center. We are completing the design of this nine?
story building and intend to break ground in early
2017 with occupancy expected in late 201 8. Plans
continue to move forward to relocate all of the
services currently provided in Fantus to prepare for
its demolition and additional parking by mid-2017.

There is a lot happening within our system. I hope
that this newsletter and other communications
continue to provide you with valuable information.

Dr. Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer
