Update from Deborah Tate, System Director of Human Resources
Ms. Tate introduced her team, which included the following individuals: Betty Torres, responsible for human
resources at Stroger Hospital; Jim Dyson, responsible for labor relations for Stroger Hospital and various special
projects; Tom Jablonski, responsible for labor relations at Provident Hospital; and Paris Partee, responsible for
human resources at Provident Hospital.
Ms. Tate provided an update on the hiring process, which included information on its current state, the
challenges experienced through the process, and what she envisions as the future state (Attachment #1).
Additionally, a list of action items relating to the subject was presented.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of challenges experienced in the process, the Committee raised questions regarding the
length of time it takes to post and fill a position. Also discussed was the perceived lack of trust between the two
human resources entities (the System’s Human Resource department and the Cook County Bureau of Human
Resources). It was stated that the County’s Bureau personnel do not trust the System hiring managers, as they
feel that the System hiring managers manipulate the system.
Board Chairman Batts inquired whether the System is able to post positions on its new website. Ms. Tate
responded affirmatively. An individual at each facility is responsible for posting the positions for their facility
on the website. She added that there is also a link to the County’s Bureau of Human Resources website.
The Committee discussed the possibility of creating qualified applicant pools for positions with the same
minimum requirements. This would reduce the time needed to fill a position, as currently, each applicant has to
apply for each position.
In response to a question from Director Carvalho regarding whether her human resources team would be housed
in one location or at each facility, Ms. Tate responded that she was unsure; that decision will be partly impacted
by the availability of space. Director Carvalho noted that this subject has been an issue with the County
Commissioners in the past.
__________________________
Discussion of Personnel Matters.
Update on labor negotiations.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Lyne, moved to recess the regular session and convene into
closed session, pursuant to an exception to the Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(2), et seq., which
permits closed meetings for consideration of “collective negotiating matters between the public body and
its employees or their representatives, or deliberations concerning salary schedules for one or more
classes of employees,” and pursuant to an exception to the Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(1), which
permits closed meetings for consideration of “the appointment, employment, compensation, discipline,
performance, or dismissal of specific employees of the public body or legal counsel for the public body,
including hearing testimony on a complaint lodged against an employee of the public body or against
legal counsel for the public body to determine its validity.”
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
Chairman Zopp declared that the closed session was adjourned, and the Committee convened into
regular session.
