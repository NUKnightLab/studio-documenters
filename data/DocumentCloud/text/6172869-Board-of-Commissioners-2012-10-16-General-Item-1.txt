GENERAL BAQKQROUND
On February 3, 2012, after participating in the Request for Proposal process, David Gomez Associates, an

executive search ?rm was awarded a contract with the CHA. Initially, this firm was asked to identify executive and
senior level ?nancial personnel to ?ll our Executive Vice-President/Chief Financial Officer and Vice-President of
Budgeting vacancies. However, when our Executive Vice-President, Development resigned in April, 2012, we asked
David Gomez Associates to source candidates for this position as well.

We have been very pleased with the caliber of candidates presented by David Gomez Associates. They have been
able to successfully tap into that unique group of ?passive? candidates who are employed and not actively seeking
other employment. Additionally, their rate of 20% is less than their peers which can charge as much as 35% of the
annual salary of the candidate who is selected.

To date, we have paid the ?rm $99,000 for three placements. We need to expand the original scope of work so that it
is broad enough to include non-?nancial personnel. This expansion would allow David Gomez and Associates to
recruit other executive level candidates with senior leadership experience.

Given our current need to identify a Chief Housing Officer and potentially an additional executive level position and
the time parameters associated with implementing a new RFP process, the most efficient solution is to continue to
work with David Gomez and Associates.
