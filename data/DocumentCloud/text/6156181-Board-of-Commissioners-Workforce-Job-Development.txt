presentation to the Committee on Workforce Job Development and Training Opportunities.
(See attachment 

Commissioner Sims voiced concern over the dropout rate in District 

Ms. Crawford stated the following: The youth funding stream comes in one lump sum.
Office provides funding to programs for in-school and out-of?school youth. The
agencies are submitting proposals to P.O.E.T. to be evaluated. P.O.E.T. evaluates how the in-
schooi youth programs are in fact affecting the dropout rate and the graduation rate. The out-of-
school youth programs are run by the schools. Most are run by community agencies which are
responsible for identifying, finding and recruiting people who have dropped out and re-engaging
them so that they obtain their General Equivalent Diploma and placing them into post-secondary
training, college or the military. This is how success is graded.

Ms. Crawford continued to state re?engaging the youth on day-to?day basics is what P.O.E.T.
looks for agencies to do in the One Stop Centers. The One Stop Centers welcomes youth to
the programs without qualification to go into training or college. P.O.E.T. Office engages the
youth to prepare for their GED's and other programs.

Chairman Collins inquired as to how the State Department of Labor obtains their information.
Ms. Crawford responded: Service providers enter information on the participants into the Illinois
Workforce Development Systems Participants are identified by their social security
number. Additional information related to the participants? employment is pulled from Cook
County P.O.E.T. and the State of Information is obtained from the providers and from
the State of Illinois. The State of Illinois reports to the Federal government.

Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to Receive and File
Communication No. 293650. The motion carried.

Cook County POE 

Section Information
Introduction

POET has worked aggressively to raise public awareness of its job placement and training services, and to reach out to prospective employers in
the business community. Since December 2006, POET has placed approximately 800 adult and dislocated workers into jobs with an average salary
of $12.68/hr. On average, that represents roughly eight percent in wage reductions for dislocated workers compared to the national average of
over 20 percent in salary loss. The agency has also worked aggressively in the last year to revise and update ?scal policies and procedures to
foster best practices in ?scal oversight.

efforts on behalf of constituencies like people with disabilities has not gone unacknowledged; the agency was recently named the co-
recipient along with Operation Access of the prestigious 2007 Henry B. Betts Employment Advocacy AWard, presented by the Rehabilitative
Institute of Chicago, for a continued commitment in bringing awareness to the employability of persons with disabilities.

Section Information
C. Ex-Offender Program

Cook County?s Re-entry Initiatives

At the request of Cook County Board President Todd Stroger, P.O.E.T is developing programs to implement the County?s re-entry ordinance in
three phases which are outlined below.

Concurrent with Phase I: Creation of a Re-entry Committee

A key element of the County's ordinance is the creation of a Re-entry Committee. The members of this committee serve at the pleasure of the
President and must include one Commissioner as well as a representative of organized labor. Once POET has gathered a list of viable candidates
for Phase I and the required language referencing the re-entry program is included in appropriate construction bid documents, we will recommend a
slate of potential Re-entry Committee members for the President?s consideration. 

Phase I: implementation in the 2008 construction season

Phase I will begin this Spring as we distribute applications and compile a list of eligible candidates who already posses union cards. We will match
these applicants to bidders willing to participate in this ?rst phase of the re?entry initiatives. Once matched, these applicants may participate in
upcoming County-sponsored construction projects during this year's construction season. in addition to these efforts, POET is actively compiling
information on WIA recognized registered apprenticeships and other programs that will be used to train applicants in Phase ll.

9 Develop a pool of applicants who possess union cards.

. Assist the Purchasing Agent in revising bid documents to incorporate re-entry language.

. Provide assistance. as required in communicating program to bidders. 

. Match applicants with successful bidders participating in the Cook County re-entry program.

Phase II: Implementation in the 2009 construction season

Phase ll will begin in 2009 and will involve a much iarger pool of candidates who, if chosen. will participate in registered apprenticeship programs
which can place them in established unions. These candidates will become part of the available labor pool for 2009 construction projects. POET
writ provide financial assistance to successful applicants to cover the expenses related to their training in WIA and Union recognized apprenticeship
programs and placement in Trade Unions affiliated with the County.

. Get CCWIB direction on apprenticeships and make the necessary revisions to the strategic plan for approval from the State of Illinois.
. Implement recommended registered apprenticeship programs

.- - a I .1 t. i 
Cook County POEI

. Develop a pool of applicants suitable for training and the training institutions.
0 Track 8: Place

Phase the Green Jobs Initiative, implementation in the 2010 construction season

Phase of the program will give us the opportunity to pursue outside funding so as to build upon the original goals of the County's re-entry
ordinance to inciude other occupations. such as green construction jobs. Phase Ill. the Green Jobs initiative, will begin in 2010 and will involve
youth from the Cook County Boot Camp. These youth will participate in an innovative curriculum, soon to be in development, that will introduce
them to environmental issues while they pursue their GEDs and receive ore-apprenticeship training that will allow them to. upon graduation,
transition into the registered apprenticeship programs of Phase ll.

. Finalize Green Jobs Initiative Phase 

- Procure outside sources of funding
