notice as herein provided, in such principal amounts and from such maturities as the Designated Officer shall
determine in the Bond Order and by lot within a single maturity, at such redemption prices (not exceeding 102%
of par) and for such periods of redemption as shall be determined in the Bond Order.
In the event of the redemption of less than all the Bonds of like series and maturity, the aggregate
principal amount thereof to be redeemed shall be $5,000 or an integral multiple thereof and the bond registrar
shall assign to each Bond of such maturity a distinctive number for each $5,000 principal amount of such Bond
and shall select by lot from the numbers so assigned as many numbers as, at $5,000 for each number, shall equal
the principal amount of such Bonds to be redeemed. The Bonds to be redeemed shall be the Bonds to which
were assigned numbers so selected; provided that only so much of the principal amount of each Bond shall be
redeemed as shall equal $5,000 for each number assigned to it and so selected.
Notice of the redemption of the Bonds shall be mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior
to the date fixed for such redemption to the registered owner(s) of Bonds to be redeemed at their last addresses
appearing on said registration books. The Bonds or portions thereof specified in said notice shall become due
and payable at the applicable redemption price on the redemption date therein designated, and if, on the
redemption date, moneys for payment of the redemption price of all the Bonds or portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest to the redemption date, shall be available for such payment on said date, and if
notice of redemption shall have been mailed as aforesaid (and notwithstanding any defect therein or the lack of
actual receipt thereof by any registered owner) then from and after the redemption date interest on such Bonds or
portions thereof shall cease to accrue and become payable. If there shall be drawn for redemption less than all of
a Bond, the District shall execute and the bond registrar shall authenticate and deliver, upon surrender of such
Bond, without charge to the owner thereof, in exchange for the unredeemed balance of the Bond so surrendered,
Bonds of like series, maturity, interest rate and of the denomination of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof.

The bond registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Bond after notice of the redemption
of all or a portion thereof has been mailed. The bond registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any
Bond during a period of 15 days next preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption that could designate for
redemption all or a portion of such Bond.

office of the Secretary of the District, is hereby approved. In connection with the sale of the Bonds, the
Designated Officer is authorized and directed to execute and deliver one or more Bond Purchase Agreements in
substantially the form of the Bond Purchase Agreement on file in the office of the Secretary of the District, with
such changes and completions as may be approved by the Designated Officer, subject to the limitations of this
ordinance. The execution and delivery of a Bond Purchase Agreement shall constitute conclusive evidence of the
approval of such changes and completions. The Designated Officer also is authorized and directed to execute
and deliver all documents relating to the issuance and sale of the Bonds, subject to the limitations of this
ordinance.
The Designated Officer is hereby authorized and directed to appoint an escrow agent (the “Escrow
Agent”) and establish a refunding escrow fund (the “Refunding Escrow Fund”), if necessary, in connection with
the refunding of the Prior Bonds and is also authorized and directed to execute and deliver any related agreement
(the “Escrow Agreement”). The execution and delivery of an Escrow Agreement, if any relating to the refunding
of the Prior Bonds shall constitute conclusive evidence of the approval of such agreement.
Each of the documents approved by this Section may be executed in one or more counterparts. The
corporate seal of the District, or a facsimile thereof may, if required, be affixed or otherwise reproduced upon
each document and attested by the manual or authorized facsimile signature of the Secretary of the District.
Section 8. Continuing Disclosure. For the benefit of the beneficial owners of the Bonds, the District
covenants and agrees to deliver to the beneficial owners information as provided in the Bond Purchase
Agreement.

authority is delegated to the Designated Officer to sell the Bonds to the Purchaser, provided that:
(i)
the Bonds shall be sold at a price of not less than par;
(ii)
the principal of and interest on the Limited Tax Bonds payable in each debt service year
shall not be greater than the debt service taxes levied for the applicable tax levy year pursuant to Section
14 of this ordinance;
(iii)
the principal of and interest on the Unlimited Tax Refunding Bonds payable in each
debt service year shall not be greater than the debt service taxes levied for the applicable tax levy year
pursuant to Section 17 of this ordinance;
(B)
As used in paragraph (A) of this Section, the term “debt service year” means the year following
the applicable tax levy year;
(C)
The sale and award of the Bonds shall be evidenced by one or more Bond Orders, which shall be
signed by the Designated Officer. An executed counterpart of each Bond Order shall be filed in the office of the
Secretary and entered in the records of the District;

(D)
The President, the Treasurer, the Secretary, the Chief Financial Officer and other officials of the
District are authorized and directed to do and perform, or cause to be done or performed for or on behalf of the
District each and everything necessary for the issuance of the Bonds, including, but not limited to, the proper
execution and delivery of the Bonds and the Bond Purchase Agreement.
Section 10. Execution and Authentication. Each Bond shall be executed in the name of the District by
the manual or authorized facsimile signature of its President and shall be countersigned by the manual or
Page 17 of 23

 authorized facsimile signature of its Treasurer. The corporate seal of the District, or a facsimile thereof, shall be
thereunto affixed or otherwise reproduced upon each Bond and attested by the manual or authorized facsimile
signature of the Secretary of the District.
In case any officer whose signature, or a facsimile of whose signature, shall appear on any Bond shall
cease to hold such office before the issuance of the Bond, such Bond shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient
for all purposes, the same as if the person whose signature, or a facsimile thereof, appears on such Bond had not
ceased to hold such office. Any Bond may be signed, countersigned, sealed or attested on behalf of the District
by any person who, on the date of such act, shall hold the proper office, notwithstanding that at the date of such
Bond such person may not have held such office. No recourse shall be had for the payment of any Bonds against
any officer who executes the Bonds.
Each Bond shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication executed manually by the bond registrar. No
Bond shall be entitled to any right or benefit under this ordinance or shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose
until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly executed by the bond registrar.
Section 11. Transfer, Exchange and Registry. The Bonds shall be negotiable, subject to the
provisions for registration of transfer contained herein and in the Bond Purchase Agreement. Each Bond shall
be transferable only upon the registration books maintained by the District for that purpose at the corporate trust
office of the bond registrar, by the registered owner thereof in person or by his attorney duly authorized in
writing, upon surrender thereof together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the bond registrar
and duly executed by the registered owner or his duly authorized attorney. Upon the surrender for transfer of
any such Bond, the District shall execute and the bond registrar shall authenticate and deliver a new Bond or
Bonds registered in the name of the transferee, of the same aggregate principal amount, series, maturity and
interest rate as the surrendered Bond. The Bonds, upon surrender thereof at the corporate trust office of the
bond registrar, with a written instrument satisfactory to the bond registrar, duly executed by the registered owner
or his attorney duly authorized in writing, may be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of Bonds
of the same series, maturity and interest rate and of the denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof.
For every such exchange or registration of transfer of Bonds, the District or the bond registrar may make
a charge sufficient for the reimbursement of any tax, fee or other governmental charge required to be paid with
respect to such exchange or transfer, which sum or sums shall be paid by the person requesting such exchange or
transfer as a condition precedent to the exercise of the privilege of making such exchange or transfer. No other
charge shall be made for the privilege of making such transfer or exchange. The provisions of the Illinois Bond
Replacement Act, 30 Illinois Compiled Statutes 315, shall govern the replacement of lost, destroyed or defaced
Bonds.
The District and the bond registrar may deem and treat the person in whose name any Bond shall be
registered upon the registration books as the absolute owner of such Bond, whether such Bond shall be overdue
or not, for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal of, redemption premium, if any,
or interest thereon and for all other purposes whatsoever, and all such payments so made to any such registered
owner or upon his order shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon such Bond to the
extent of the sum or sums so paid, and neither the District nor the bond registrar shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary.
Section 12. Security for Limited Tax Bonds. The Limited Tax Bonds are issued as “limited bonds” as
defined and referred to in the Local Government Debt Reform Act. The Limited Tax Bonds are payable from
the District’s “debt service extension base,” as defined in the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, 35 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 200/18-185 through 18-245. The District covenants that it will not issue any bonds, notes or
other obligations if the issuance thereof would cause the anticipated tax extension for any tax levy year for
limited bonds of the District to exceed the debt service extension base of the District less the amount in items
(b), (c), (e) and (h) of the applicable definition of “aggregate extension” contained in the Property Tax Extension
Limitation Law, for non-referendum obligations, except obligations initially issued pursuant to referendum.
Page 18 of 23

 The full faith and credit of the District are hereby irrevocably pledged to the punctual payment of the
principal of and interest on the Limited Tax Bonds. The Limited Tax Bonds shall be direct and general
obligations of the District, and the District shall be obligated to levy ad valorem taxes upon all the taxable
property in the District for the payment of the Limited Tax Bonds and the interest thereon, without limitation as
to rate, but limited as to amount by provisions of the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law.
Section 13. Form of Limited Tax Bonds. The Limited Tax Bonds shall be issued as fully registered
bonds and shall be in substantially the following form, the blanks to be appropriately completed when the
Limited Tax Bonds are printed:
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, by purchase of the Series 2015_ Bonds, each
investor in the Series 2015_ Bonds will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
AUTHORIZING THE CHICAGO BOTANIC GARDEN TO INCREASE SEASONAL PARKING FEES
FOR NON-MEMBERS
WHEREAS, the Chicago Botanic Garden (“the Garden”) has remained one of the top attractions in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, in 2005, the Garden attracted a total of 697,000 guests; and
WHEREAS, in 2014, attendance at the Garden surpassed the one-million-visit-benchmark with 1,058,000
visits, an increase of 6% over 2013 and a 52% increase since 2005; and
WHEREAS, although the number of guests have increased, the Garden has never charged an admission
fee; and
WHEREAS, the Garden is one of the only major cultural institutions in the Chicagoland area to not charge an
admission fee; and
WHEREAS, while the Garden is extremely proud of the increased attendance numbers, this success frequently
becomes a detriment to the visitor experience and Garden-wide commitment to outstanding customer service;
and
WHEREAS, weekend visitorship has increased, guests waiting to enter the garden experience lengthy delays
and the Garden’s 1,200 parking spaces are quickly filled; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to meet this challenge and encourage guests to visit the Garden on days other than
weekends the Garden requests support for a seasonal parking rate increase of $5.00 for non-members on the
weekends and holidays from April 1st through October 31st; and
WHEREAS, members of the Garden do not pay a parking fee; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of the Cook County
Forest Preserve District authorizes the Chicago Botanic Garden to increase its parking fee for Non-Members by
$5.00 on weekends and holidays from April 1st to October 31st.
A motion was made by Vice Chairman Steele, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, that this Resolution be
recommended for approval. The motion carried by the following vote:
