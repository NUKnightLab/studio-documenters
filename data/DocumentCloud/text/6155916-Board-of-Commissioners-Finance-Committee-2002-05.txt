with the advice and consent of the Finance Subcommittee on Industrial Claims
on February 7, 2002 and approved by the Industrial Commission providing for
payment to the Petitioner the sum of $153,000.00. As part of the settlement,
the County received credit of $24,000.00 for ordinary disability benefits paid by
the Cook County Employee's Annuity and Benefit Fund towards temporary total
disability benefits that had been awarded by the Industrial Commission in a
partial trial of the case under Section 19(b) of the Worker's Compensation Act.
Section 8U) of the Worker's Compensation Act credits the employer with
payments of non-occupational disability benefits and health benefits made
under plans contributed to by the employer, but requires the employer to hold
the Petitioner harmless from claims for reimbursement from those plans.
Following his resignation from County employment, the Petitioner is seeking to
withdraw his pension contributions triggering the requirement to hold the
Petitioner harmless from the Pension Fund's claim for reimbursement. As a
result of this, the Worker's Compensation Act requires that the County hold the
Petitioner harmless by reimbursing the Annuity and Benefit Fund for the credits
claimed. On April 23, 2002 , the Finance Subcommittee on Industrial Claims
approved payment to the Cook County Employee's Annuity and Benefit Fund
the sum of $24,000.00. This amount represents full payment that is due and
owed to the pension board. State's Attorney, Richard A. Devine, is submitting
