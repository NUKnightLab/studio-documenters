New Projects
The new CMAQ projects have been selected by the statewide CMAQ committee and the new
STBG, Resurfacing and TASA projects have been scored and ranked by AMATS staff and reviewed by the TAC TIP Subcommittee. Thanks to all the communities who submitted applications during the recent round of funding. Unfortunately there was only enough funding available
to pay for roughly one third of all the requests. The new projects are scheduled in FY 2024 and
2025 but may be moved up if it is ready and funds become available. Later in this meeting I will
be presenting the new projects to you and requesting approval through resolutions.
Advancement of Resurfacing Projects
We have learned that due to some STBG balances that ODOT has allocated to FY 2020 we have
a surplus of approximately $2.2 million. We are working on advancing a couple Barberton resurfacing projects and a couple New Franklin projects. The projects chosen were based on project readiness and Pavement Condition Ratings. Advancing projects has chain reaction so now
other projects can possibly move into FY 2021 and FY 2022 where those projects where. However we will wait to see what the balances are before making any additional moves. The worst
first is usually the strategy we try to use when selecting projects to advance.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

DATE:

December 11, 2019

INTRODUCTION:
The 2019 Active Transportation Plan (ATP) prepared by AMATS presents the various strategies and
recommendations that the agency will pursue to improve the Greater Akron area’s bicycle and
pedestrian networks. The ATP will be a key component of the agency’s upcoming long-range
Transportation Outlook 2045.
The ATP is the successor to the agency’s 2016 Bike Plan and 2015 Pedestrian Plan. The ATP builds
upon the foundations of the agency’s previous reports while clarifying the strategies and defining the
goals that AMATS will pursue to promote accessibility, efficiency and safety of the area’s networks.
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:
The ATP presents the agency’s vision of a region in which biking and walking are not only integral
parts of daily life, but vital components of a first-class, multi-modal transportation system. The plan
aims to expand and refine the region’s bicycle and pedestrian networks with regards to connectivity
and safety while promoting active living, sound economic development, and sustainability.
The ATP identifies several goals for improving the region’s Bicycling and Pedestrian
networks. These goals are summarized below:
 The agency will promote a zero-death target for bicycle and pedestrian crashes.
 The agency will increase the frequency and promotion of various public education
and empowerment efforts with additional Bike-N-Brainstorm and Jane’s Walk
events and additional opportunities identified by the Staff.
 Project sponsors are encouraged to maintain existing and invest in additional
shared-use and pedestrian infrastructure throughout the Greater Akron between
now and 2045.
 Communities are encouraged to pursue sidewalk network improvements with
METRO RTA and PARTA.

  The agency will seek a 100 percent participation rate among Greater Akron area
school districts in the Ohio Safe Routes to Schools (SRTS) Program.
CONCLUSION:
In addition to its posting on the agency web site – amatsplanning.org – the Draft ATP was
presented to the CIC during its Dec. 12 meeting for review and comment. To date, the agency has
received and incorporated into this document comments from the City of Green and Summit Metro
Parks.
The Staff is requesting approval of the Draft 2019 Active Transportation Plan by the AMATS Policy
Committee.

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2019 Active Transportation Plan (ATP) prepared by the Akron Metropolitan
Area Transportation Study (AMATS) presents the various strategies and
recommendations that the agency will pursue to improve the Greater Akron
area’s bicycle and pedestrian networks. The ATP will be a key component of the
upcoming long-range Transportation Outlook 2045 to be prepared by AMATS in
its role as the designated metropolitan planning organization for Portage and
Summit counties and Chippewa and Milton townships in Wayne County.
The ATP is the successor to the agency’s 2016 Bike Plan and 2015 Pedestrian Plan.
The ATP represents a more holistic planning approach by the agency with
regards to the region’s bicycle and pedestrian networks. The ATP builds upon
the foundations of these reports while clarifying the strategies and defining the
goals that AMATS will pursue to improve the accessibility, efficiency and safety
of the area’s networks.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

 PLAN VISION
Through various public outreach initiatives, the agency has determined that
many residents consider biking and walking to be desirable and vibrant modes
of travel, but not convenient or – in some cases – safe modes.
The ATP envisions a Greater Akron area in which biking and walking are not
only integral parts of daily life, but vital components of a first-class, multimodal transportation system. The ATP seeks to expand and refine the region’s
bicycle and pedestrian networks with regards to connectivity and safety while
promoting active living, sound economic development, and sustainability
throughout the region.
The ATP is divided into two sections devoted to the region’s Bicycling and
Pedestrian networks respectively. Each section includes three components that
address connectivity, efficiency and safety.
The ATP presents the Greater Akron area with a comprehensive, sound vision to
pursue regional connectivity while promoting safety for the area’s cyclists and
pedestrians. The ideas presented within this document allow the region to build
on the successes of previous bike and pedestrian plans prepared by the agency
yet represent fresh opportunities for improvement.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

 BICYCLING
A basic tenet of the 2019 Active Transportation Plan (ATP) is to ensure that there
will be transportation choices for people of all ages and abilities within the
Greater Akron area. Cycling is an increasingly important component of the
transportation system as both a recreational amenity and a viable transportation
choice. It is a low-cost, sustainable alternative to driving and improves access
and mobility for many people. Many Greater Akron area communities recognize
the growing role of biking as a transportation option and are incorporating
bicycle infrastructure into their future plans.
The ability of a community to accommodate cyclists can have direct economic,
health, social, and environmental impacts. Making the Greater Akron area a
more bicycle-friendly region will connect people and places, promote a healthy
lifestyle, and stimulate positive economic impacts.

EXISTING BIKING NETWORK
The Greater Akron area’s bike network currently encompasses over 122 miles of
shared-use paths and 50 miles of bike lanes. Significant elements of this regional
network include The Ohio & Erie Towpath Trail, the Summit Metro Parks Bike
and Hike Trail, The Portage Hike and Bike Trail, and the Headwaters Trail. The
map on page 5 details the area’s Existing Bicycle Network.
The region’s network will likely continue to grow in the future as these shareduse paths present many opportunities for nearby communities to link to the
current bike network. The completion of the Freedom Trail in Summit County, a
shared-use path linking the downtowns of Akron and Kent via The Portage Hike
and Bike Trail, exemplifies the sort of connections that area communities should
pursue to promote biking as a viable means of transportation.

bike.
On-road facilities, most notably bike lanes, are gradually beginning to fill in
remaining gaps and connect people to various destinations. The ATP encourages
AMATS member communities and project sponsors to develop lanes and other
facilities that will close gaps, especially if they provide access to the daily needs
of the area’s cyclists such as employment, education, food and medical care.

BICYCLE SAFETY
Safety concerns often deter people from choosing cycling over driving a motor
vehicle. Overcoming the reluctance of would-be cyclists can be accomplished
through the development of new safe active transportation infrastructure such
as bike boulevards, bike lanes, shared-use paths, and wide shoulders. With the
public’s growing interest in the benefits of active transportation, promoting and
providing safe environments will likely become increasingly important.
Such infrastructure investments may represent prudent expenditures by
communities and project sponsors considering that - out of the 243 bicyclerelated crashes that occurred in the Greater Akron area between 2015 and 2017
- a staggering 191 crashes or 79 percent resulted in an injury (See chart below).
Tragically, three crashes resulted in fatalities. AMATS has determined that
many of these crashes involve younger cyclists, including children. The largest
age group involved in bicycle-related crashes during the period was 14-yearolds with 18 crashes.

Connecting shared-use paths to such destinations as downtowns and other
commercial areas promotes biking, not just for recreation, but for commuting.
These linkages, coupled with appropriate biking amenities, provide opportunities
for cyclists of various ages, abilities, and incomes.
While the Greater Akron area’s network has experienced significant growth
in recent years, major gaps remain in the region’s still-burgeoning network.
These gaps make it difficult, unsafe, and unpleasant for people to access many
destinations. These network gaps discourage people from choosing to ride a

 BICYCLE ACCESSIBILITY
The ATP urges Greater Akron area communities to pursue complete street
principles in the coming years. Changing built environments to make physical
activity such as cycling more appealing and accessible through sound land use
practices and roadway design with all users in mind is at the core of AMATS’
efforts with this plan.
People who cannot or prefer not to drive should have safe and efficient
transportation choices. The more accessible a system is, the more likely that
people will opt to choose active transportation for their trips to school, stores,
medical care and recreational opportunities. The region’s bicycle facilities
should meet accessibility requirements and provide safe, convenient, and
interconnected transportation networks.
Many barriers exist that can prevent potential active transportation such as
cycling from being a viable choice. Eliminating physical barriers may mean
providing routes around steep slopes or across freeways, rail lines or waterways.
Other means to improve accessibility include places to rest such as benches and
ensuring safe crossing times across busy roadways.
Existing shared-use paths provide a strong framework for creating a
comprehensive bicycle network. These paths are used primarily for recreation,
but also serve as portions of routes for commuter trips. The area’s larger paths
present unique opportunities to develop a more extensive, regional on-road
bicycle network with convenient links to public transit routes and service.
The regional bike network continues to grow at a slow, but steady pace. There
are 122 total miles of shared-use paths throughout Greater Akron, including The
Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail. The Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail makes up
41 miles north to south through Summit County. The Summit Metro Parks Bike
and Hike Trail, The Portage Hike and Bike Trail and Headwaters Trail make up
another 47 miles of the region’s shared-use paths.

The bicycle is often the most time-efficient mode of travel for short trips,
especially in urban areas. In many urban areas, bicycles offer the flexibility of
a motor vehicle while providing other conveniences such as free parking, the
ability to park closer to destinations, and faster travel times compared to motor
vehicles.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

The ATP, while recognizing that many Greater Akron area neighborhood streets
and county road systems are suitable for cycling in their present form, suggests
that communities consider developing dedicated bicycle facilities on their major
streets and roadways where feasible. Key ingredients to the successful pursuit
of such facilities are practicality and public support. Both of these ingredients
can be gauged through demonstration projects prior to the development of
actual projects. By concentrating improvements for cyclists on major streets
that feed into existing shared-use paths, an interconnected regional system will
emerge in the Greater Akron area that capitalizes on a majority of roadways
that are already bicycle-compatible.
In the interim – until such a system fully emerges – the ATP urges area communities
to improve and maintain their streets and roadways to accommodate all forms
of vehicular traffic, including bicycles. Improvements may take the form of new
directional signage, bike share stations, or the orientation of sewer grates so
that they do not pose hazards to cyclists.
Regular maintenance of roadway surfaces prevents the formation of rough
pavement, which not only diminishes the enjoyment of a bicycle ride, but also
poses a significant hazard to cyclists. When encountering potholes and patches,
cyclists generally face the dilemma of having to swerve into traffic around the
obstacles or having to ride over or through them, risking a heightened possibility
of crashing and sustaining injury in either case. Poor pavement conditions may
push some cyclists to follow longer, more circuitous routes to their destinations
to avoid the danger and discomfort of a deteriorated road. Still others may
choose a different mode of transportation altogether.
The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) utilizes a method of visually
assessing pavement condition known as the Pavement Condition Rating (PCR)
system. Pavement condition is rated on a scale from 0 (Very Poor) to 100
(Excellent). The map on page 7 highlights the segments in the Greater Akron
area that are rated either Poor or Very Poor. Analysis of the PCR along known
and potential cycling corridors can aid community leaders in deciding how to
prioritize repairs. Smooth and well-maintained routes will eliminate the need
for cyclists to follow less-direct paths to their desired destinations. This should
result in improved safety and efficiency in terms of on-road bicycle routes.

 BICYCLE GOALS AND STRATEGIES
The League of American Bicyclists has identified the 5 E’s of Bicycling, which are
principles that are fundamental to the establishment and maintenance of a safe,
bicycle-friendly community. These principles are:





Engineering
Education
Enforcement
Encouragement
Evaluation

These principles and how AMATS will promote them in the Greater Akron area
are elaborated below:
Engineering
A safe and inviting bicycle network is comprised of a variety of physical
elements. Examples of infrastructure that may be considered for
incorporation into the regional bicycle network include:




Wide shoulders

Maintaining road and trail surfaces to be free of potholes and debris is
also critical to increasing a cyclist’s safety and confidence. AMATS plays a
key role in ensuring that the Greater Akron area’s roads and trail surfaces
are well-maintained. The agency, as the area’s federally designated
metropolitan planning organization, provides the financial and technical
support that communities and project sponsors need to meet their
maintenance demands.
AMATS administers several robust federal funding programs on behalf of
the area. The Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG), Resurfacing,
and Transportation Alternatives Set-Aside (TASA) programs exist to assist
communities with their construction and maintenance needs. Projects

2019 Active Transportation Plan

funded by these programs run the gamut of major widenings to streetscape
improvements. AMATS develops and applies the criteria - under the
direction of its membership - for applicants seeking funding from these
programs for various purposes. The agency provides technical support
through analyses of the area’s transportation networks such as safety and
Level-of-Service studies and through coordination when appropriate and
necessary with other entities such as the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and the Ohio and U.S.
departments of transportation.
Education
Education includes the coordinated distribution of information regarding
existing bicycle facilities and their role in the area’s transportation system.
AMATS provides education and outreach through its Switching Gears
Program, the agency’s regional initiative to promote cycling. This program
promotes cycling through three notable products and services described in
the bullets below:
 Switching-Gears.org – A website dedicated to advocating and
promoting regional cycling. The website is a clearinghouse of
information about bike-related events, cycle shops, regional trails,
and maintenance and safety tips.
 Bike-N-Brainstorm Events – These are public meetings which include
a bike ride and brainstorming session among AMATS staff and
participants. Cyclists become active players in transportation
planning by sharing their insights on how to improve biking and
pedestrian access in a community. The agency uses feedback from
these events when weighing bike and pedestrian projects for the
region.
 Bike User Map – A free comprehensive map of streets and shared-use
paths in the AMATS region. The map rates cycling routes according
to their respective levels of difficulty. AMATS periodically updates
the map and distributes this item at events, bicycle shops, libraries,
community centers, and other appropriate venues throughout the
region.
Enforcement
The proper use and full value of the bicycle network hinges on the
enforcement of laws pertaining to the interaction between motorists
and cyclists. AMATS promotes public awareness of laws and regulations

 impacting cyclists through its press releases, social media and web site
postings. An example of such laws that AMATS has promoted is the state
of Ohio’s “three-foot” law enacted in 2017. This law requires motorists to
provide a three-foot buffer between their vehicles and a cyclist when passing
on a roadway. (Motorists found violating this law face a misdemeanor
charge and a $150 fine.)
AMATS seeks opportunities to partner with local police departments
at appropriate events promoting public safety, such as “Bike Rodeos,”
conferences, fairs, and workshops. The agency also has a working rapport
with local and county law enforcement officials and the Ohio Department
of Public Safety (ODPS) which it utilizes during the compilation of various
crash reports and safety studies regarding travel within the region.
Encouragement
Even with well-engineered facilities and sufficient education, people
still need encouragement to bike. Encouragement may come from any
combination of special events, riding groups, public advertising campaigns,
health promotions, local cycling media and websites. AMATS promotes
cycling by participating in, and planning events such as Bike-N-Brainstorms
and Bike-to-Work Week.
Evaluation
Planning an effective bicycle network requires both the evaluation of
systems already in place and the determination and design of new facilities
to be integrated into the existing infrastructure. An important component
of this latter consideration is the incorporation of ancillary elements, such
as those listed above under Engineering, into the design of residential and
commercial developments. Successful planning also focuses on assessing
the present and projected extent of cycling in the Greater Akron area
and access to attractions and destinations in the communities served by
the area’s cycling network. The ATP provides a frank assessment of the
network’s current status and offers direction for its future development
based on connectivity and complete street approaches.
AMATS accepts the five “E” principles put forth by the League of American
Bicyclists as appropriate standards by which to assess and improve
the Greater Akron area’s bicycle network. The agency will apply these
principles in the pursuit of the desired outcomes of fewer bicycle-related
crashes and zero fatalities. The agency will routinely evaluate how the
region is meeting these principles through annual bicycle assessments to

measure the success of service provided in terms of physical biking facilities
and ridership patterns.
The ATP states the following goals for the Greater Akron area regarding the
promotion of cycling as a mode of active transportation. This listing includes
potential strategies for use by AMATS and its members in the pursuit of these
goals.
1.

Promote a zero-death target for bicycle crashes and overall
bicycle crash reduction.

Strategies:
The agency will weigh the potential safety benefits to cyclists of project
applications to its funding programs. Examples of safety-oriented projects
include new bicycle and pedestrian facilities like shared-use paths, improved
crossings and lighting, road diets, and other traffic calming measures.
Other bicycle goals listed below also will work toward educating AMATS
members and the public of ways to achieve a zero bicycle death target and
overall crash reduction.
2. Attract 500 new attendees to workshops and public
empowerment events between approval of the ATP
and its next update by AMATS.
Strategies:
The agency will host a minimum of four Bike-N-Brainstorm events per year.
AMATS developed the Bike-N-Brainstorm in 2012 to serve as an innovative
tool for public outreach. Jointly arranged with community officials from
within the AMATS region, these events engage participants by giving them
a voice in the planning process for potential improvements to the bicycle
network within the host community.
In the future, the agency will seek to broaden the scope of these events
beyond bicycle planning to address related public health and safety
issues. The agency will invite representatives of local and county health
departments to discuss how cycling and networks may benefit the public.
The participation of health officials will provide the agency with another
resource to promote awareness of and participation in these events. AMATS
will also partner with area communities to distribute 1,000 complimentary
LED bicycle lights, water bottles and other safety-related items and literature
when possible.

 3. AMATS encourages its membership to invest an average of
$1.1 million in TASA funds per year in additional shared-use
and pedestrian infrastructure throughout the Greater Akron
area between now and 2045.

4. Improve pavement to ensure efficient trips by investing a
minimum of $2.5 million per year in STBG and Resurfacing
funds in the Greater Akron area’s road surfaces between
now and 2045.

Strategies:

Strategies:

The agency will apply available resources through its funding programs,
primarily the TASA Program, to the development of new cycling, pedestrian
and shared-use facilities, networks and systems, especially those that
provide access to heretofore inaccessible areas, and related active
transportation amenities and support infrastructure. The ATP recommends
that the AMATS membership commit a base level of funding resources of
$1.1 million per year toward the development of new facilities, networks and
systems for the duration of the ATP. This funding commitment should not
exclude the use of new local, state and federal funding opportunities should
they arise during the life of the ATP nor should such opportunities affect the
agency’s commitment to a set level of funding for such projects.

AMATS members are encouraged to not only maintain, but to invest and
improve pavement and road surfaces in their respective communities
to ensure smoother road conditions for cyclists. The agency’s STBG and
Resurfacing funding programs are the best available resources to help
communities achieve this goal. Those projects that include bike lanes and
wide shoulders to accommodate cyclists may receive additional points
under forthcoming scoring criteria. The ATP recommends that the AMATS
membership commit a minimum investment of $2.5 million per year in
area pavement and road surfaces for the duration of the ATP. This funding
commitment should not exclude the use of new local, state and federal
funding opportunities should they arise during the life of the ATP nor should
such opportunities affect the agency’s commitment to a set level of funding
for such projects.

Applicants for major improvement projects may receive additional points
under forthcoming scoring criteria for projects that provide access to
major shared-use paths while incorporating connectivity and complete
street principles into their design. Examples of projects that may qualify for
such points include new bike lanes, dedicated bike and pedestrian bridges,
crossings, wide shoulders, and convenient links to shared-use paths.
The accompanying table presents bike-oriented projects that are currently
planned for the Greater Akron area. These projects exemplify the type that
the agency should continue to pursue in the coming years.

SUMMARY
The Bicycling section of the ATP recognizes that the Greater Akron area’s
existing bike network is incomplete in its present form. The ATP embraces the
five principles of Engineering, Education, Enforcement, Encouragement and
Evaluation as put forth by The League of American Bicyclists as its guiding
tenets to improving the area’s network.
While AMATS believes that the four goals and strategies identified in this
section represent sound approaches to further development of the regional
bike network with available resources, the member communities of AMATS
should by no means limit themselves to the Goals and Strategies presented in
these pages. Members are encouraged to pursue opportunities to promote
cycling as a form of active transportation within their respective communities.
The membership should do so with the knowledge that resources in the form
of financial and technical support are available from AMATS to assist them in
their endeavors.

 SHARED-USE PATH RECOMMENDATIONS
While all shared-use paths are eligible for funding through AMATS, it is important to identify specific shared-use paths of regional significance. The table below and the

 WALKING
The 2019 Active Transportation Plan (ATP) defines a pedestrian as a person travelling
on foot, in a wheelchair, or in another health-related mobility device. Sidewalks
are walkways separated from a roadway with a curb and are constructed of a
durable, hard and smooth surface, designed for preferential or exclusive use by
pedestrians. The sidewalk is where pedestrians do most of their traveling and is
the space where they should be able to move freely and feel safe from collisions
with vehicles, including bicycles. The pedestrian environment is shaped by this
infrastructure and other factors such as parks, land use, availability of transit,
and private development.
Despite the Greater Akron area’s overall walkability, the presence, quality, and
connectivity of its pedestrian networks vary greatly throughout the region from
community to community. This lack of network connectivity affects pedestrian
comfort and safety. The ATP urges area communities and project sponsors to
pursue a more attractive and cohesive network. The area’s network should:
🚶
🚶
🚶
🚶

Connect pedestrians to destinations
Integrate sidewalks with shared-use paths
Provide frequent and safe crossings at busy roadways
Provide wayfinding signs for easy navigation

While recognizing that there is no singular pedestrian network within the region
– nor may there ever be a need for one - the ATP envisions a network with
improved interconnectivity within and between communities that provides
adequate space to walk comfortably and promotes safety by separating
pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
Community pedestrian networks should embrace complete street principles,
be aesthetically pleasing, and provide convenient access to the necessities of a
vibrant life such as commerce, food, medical care and recreation. If community
engineers and planners carefully weigh three overarching considerations
throughout the planning process – accessibility, efficiency and safety – a
comprehensive pedestrian network with the potential for regional connectivity
may someday be realized in the Greater Akron area. The ATP addresses these
three considerations and their current states in the region’s pedestrian networks
in the passages below.

ACCESSIBILITY
The ATP defines pedestrian accessibility as the ability or ease to walk to
desired activities, destinations, goods and services within a reasonable time,
at a reasonable cost, and with the greatest convenience. Many factors affect
accessibility including built environments, land use, pedestrian amenities,
network connectivity, and integration between travel modes.
To ensure that sidewalks are accessible to pedestrians, the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) promotes sidewalk dimensions based on a “zone
system.” The zone system determines the width of the sidewalk corridor and
ensures that obstacles, such as newspaper boxes or utility poles, do not limit
pedestrian access. Communities with walkable commercial districts may want
to adopt a similar system to ensure that their pedestrian areas are as accessible
as possible, while allowing for landscaping and pedestrian amenities. The four
zones and recommended minimum standards that comprise the zone system
are described in the table below.
Zone

Curb Zone

6 inches

Planter / Furniture Zone

24 inches (48 inches if planting trees)

Pedestrian Zone

Frontage Zone

Total Sidewalk Corridor

10 feet

The AMATS region boasts 2,860 miles of sidewalks. The map on page 14
identifies the area’s 2015 Sidewalk Inventory. A number of the region’s older
established communities have extensive sidewalk networks that also provide
access to available transit service. Unfortunately, many of these older networks
also lack newer amenities and facilities that would encourage additional
pedestrian travel such as crosswalks, mid-block crossings, plazas, signs, signals,
illumination, benches and connections to shared-use paths.
While older networks may hinder pedestrian travel, it is the region’s more
recently developed suburban communities that pose some of the greatest
challenges to the promotion of pedestrian travel. Some of the larger and
more rapidly growing communities continue to lack a significant inventory
of sidewalks. These newer communities lack an established downtown from
which networks can grow.
Thanks in part to the AMATS Connecting Communities Initiative the region
has made considerable progress in promoting pedestrian accessibility in

 both its older, established and newer, suburban communities. The program
helps communities strike a balance between their land use decisions and
transportation investments by providing financial grants for the development of
plans and studies that promote vibrant, livable communities. Many communities
throughout the region are recognizing the importance of pedestrian travel since
the initiative’s launch in 2009.
Barberton’s Magic Mile Corridor, Bath Township’s State Route 18 Sidewalk
Improvement Project and Richfield’s Kinross Lakes Parkway South Project are
results of program grants. These communities used program grants to fund
studies that eventually led to significant pedestrian improvements. A number
of suburban communities are nurturing the beginnings of sound networks as a
means to promote their residents’ quality of life while providing access to local
employment, retail and service areas. The communities of Fairlawn, Green,
Twinsburg and Streetsboro exemplify this burgeoning suburban approach
within the Greater Akron area.

EFFICIENCY
The most efficient sidewalk networks tend to be those that are designed at
the outset to meet the needs of pedestrians (See Appendix C – Sidewalk Design
Principles). As past economic development and planning practices promoted
urban sprawl, roadways gradually replaced sidewalks as the primary means
to reach destinations. Generally, the greater the distance, the more likely it
becomes that people will choose motor vehicles rather than walking to get to
their destinations.
The ATP urges communities and project sponsors to adopt a more pedestrianoriented approach to transportation planning that reduces significant obstacles
to walking. During sidewalk planning and construction, logical termini should
be a prime consideration. A sidewalk should never end in the middle of nowhere,
but rather it should terminate at the entrance to a pedestrian attraction.
Demand should also be considered when planning new sidewalks. One of the
clearest signals of unmet pedestrian demand is the presence of a “goat path” – a
worn path in the grass, created from years of repeated pedestrian use. General
characteristics of sound pedestrian-oriented design are that sidewalks should:
🚶
🚶
🚶
🚶

Exist where pedestrian traffic is present
Lead to recognized destinations
Provide access to transit service
Eliminate gaps in routes or connections

Current sidewalk networks in the Greater Akron area appear to be adequate
with regards to existing in known pedestrian traffic areas and providing access

to recognized destinations (communities should decide for themselves if
improvements with regards to these characteristics should be pursued). It is in
the areas of providing pedestrian access to transit service and eliminating gaps
in network connections that the ATP urges the region’s communities to seek
improvements.
Sidewalks provide the best available means for many transit-dependent
populations – such as people with disabilities, the elderly, and low income
persons - to access bus routes and service. It is not a coincidence that most
transit stops are located on or near sidewalks. Access to these stops is especially
critical for persons using mobility devices. Currently, the Greater Akron area has
2,614 stops located throughout Portage and Summit counties (See 2019 Bus Stop
Inventory map on page 16). Of those 2,614 stops, 610 (23 percent) are located in
areas without sidewalks.
Connectivity gaps in the region’s sidewalk networks may force pedestrians
to travel along extended detours in order to avoid them. Depending on their
length, speed and traffic volume on adjacent roadways, such detours may subject
pedestrians to hazardous journeys, especially in cases where no practical detour
exists.

SAFETY
The ATP recognizes that past transportation planning practices – not just in the
Greater Akron area, but across the nation - have tended to emphasize vehicular
traffic rather than the needs of pedestrians. This emphasis has created built
environments that are difficult and unsafe for pedestrians. Pedestrians walking
on sidewalks abutting busy streets are subject to a variety of disturbances such
as vehicle noise, exhaust fumes, puddle-splashes, and potential crashes from
passing vehicles. Pedestrians will often take the most direct route to their
destination, regardless of whether the shortest route is completely legal or
safe. The AMATS Mid-Block Crossing Analysis compiled by the agency in 2014
underscores this obvious truth. The analysis found that, of the 459 pedestrianrelated crashes in the AMATS area between 2010 and 2012, 20.3 percent
occurred at locations without dedicated mid-block crossings. The agency
determined that pedestrian-related collisions with vehicles typically end in
injury - 86 percent of crashes - and sometimes death - 11 percent of all crashes.
The Dangerous by Design 2019 report published by Smart Growth America and
the National Complete Streets Coalition analyzes traffic deaths that occurred
between 2008 and 2017. The report includes a Pedestrian Danger Index (PDI)
and fatality statistics for the 100 largest metro areas as defined by the U.S.
Census Bureau. The PDI measures how deadly it is for people to walk based on
the number of people struck and killed by drivers while walking, controlling for

 the number of people that live in a state or metro area and the share of people
who walk to work.
The report finds that Americans aren’t walking more and are only driving
slightly more than they were in 2008. Driving apparently became safer between
2008 and 2017 as traffic deaths among motor vehicle occupants decreased by
6.1 percent despite vehicle miles traveled increasing by 8.1 percent. In stark
contrast, travel by walking did not experience comparable numbers. Sadly,
pedestrian deaths increased by 35.4 percent during the period although walking
as a share of all trips increased by less than 1 percent.
Despite fewer fatalities, the Akron metro area has a higher PDI index at 44.4
than larger metro areas in Ohio such as Cleveland-Elyria and Cincinnati which
have 35.9 and 42.9 respectively. The AMATS 2015-2017 Crash Report found
that there were 501 pedestrian-related crashes from 2015 to 2017 with 418 (83
percent) resulting in an injury. By comparison – in terms of percentages – 24
percent of the region’s vehicular-related crashes resulted in an injury during the
same three-year period. Tragically, 21 of the area’s pedestrian-related crashes
resulted in a fatality. Among the more troubling findings from the report is that
97 (19.4 percent) of these crashes involve people under the age of 18.

2007.

The AMATS crash report found that pedestrian crashes occur almost evenly
at intersections and at mid-block areas. Many intersection-related pedestrian
crashes occurred when a vehicle was making a turn or a pedestrian was crossing
the street against the signal. Time and light conditions are other factors affecting
the frequency of crashes in the Greater Akron area. Generally, pedestrian
crash totals begin a sharp climb in the month of September before peaking in
October, possibly due to the resumption of school and less hours of daylight.
Sizable percentages of area crashes also occur on dark roadways equipped with
lighting (33 percent) and on dark roadways lacking lighting (9 percent).

PEDESTRIAN GOALS AND STRATEGIES
The ATP proposes the following goals and strategies for communities and project
sponsors regarding pedestrian and sidewalk networks within the Greater Akron
area.
1.

Promote a zero-death target for pedestrian crashes and overall
pedestrian crash reduction.

Strategies:
Successful pedestrian projects that encourage walking tend to be those that
promote safety - not only for pedestrians - but other users of transportation
systems. Many of the Greater Akron area’s existing walking networks
consist of community sidewalks that are along busy roadways that also
serve as transit routes. Communities and project sponsors should make
pedestrian safety improvements a priority on those routes and streets with
high traffic volumes and speeds.

 Every Day Counts (EDC) initiative, which was launched by the FHWA in 2009.
One component of the EDC is the implementation of innovative strategies
to enhance roadway safety for all users. The Safe Transportation for Every
Pedestrian (STEP) Program is one such innovation. STEP advocates the
incorporation of specific pedestrian safety countermeasures that have an
established record of reducing conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles.
Such countermeasures include, but may not be limited to:
🚶
🚶
🚶
🚶
🚶
🚶
🚶

Crosswalk visibility enhancements
Leading pedestrian intervals
Pedestrian crossing/refuge islands
Pedestrian hybrid beacons
Raised crosswalks
Rectangular rapid flashing beacons
Road diets

The FHWA publishes tools to aid in the analysis of the need for pedestrian
safety countermeasures and determination of the most appropriate
treatment(s) for a given location, such as its Field Guide for Selecting
Countermeasures at Uncontrolled Pedestrian Crossing Locations. AMATS
recommends the adoption of any single one or combination of these
countermeasures where analysis deems them necessary, practicable, and
feasible. The following STEP-suggested countermeasures can improve
pedestrian safety when used in the appropriate roadway context:
🚶

🚶

🚶

18

Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFBs)
Active (user-actuated) or passive (automated detection) amber
LEDs that use an irregular flash pattern at mid-block or uncontrolled
crossing locations. They significantly increase driver-yielding
behavior.
Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs)
Signalized intersections allow pedestrians to walk, usually three to
four seconds, before vehicles get a green signal to turn left or right.
The LPI increases visibility, reduces conflicts, and improves yielding.
Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons (PHBs) or
High intensity Activated crossWalK (HAWKs)
These beacons provide positive stop control for higher-speed,
multi-lane roadways with high vehicular volumes. PHBs are an
intermediate option between a flashing beacon and a full pedestrian
signal.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

2. AMATS encourages its membership to invest an average of
$1.1 million in TASA funds per year in additional shared-use
and pedestrian infrastructure throughout the Greater Akron
area between now and 2045.
Strategies:
The goal of increasing total pedestrian or sidewalk investment throughout
the region will require the simultaneous pursuit of several general strategies
by AMATS and its membership. AMATS will aid its member communities
in seeking funding for projects to increase mileage by providing application
and technical assistance throughout the planning process. At the local
level, communities should invest in:
🚶
🚶
🚶
🚶

Sidewalks
Sidewalk amenities and infrastructure
Street projects that provide new walkways
Shared-use paths

Sidewalks and their related amenities and infrastructure are more fully
addressed in Appendix D – Sidewalk Amenities and Infrastructure.
The ATP recommends that the Greater Akron area continue investment in
sidewalk infrastructure. AMATS currently has 1.5 million programmed in
sidewalk infrastructure projects.

The area should continue similar investments in sidewalk infrastructure in
the future. Such investments will not only improve pedestrian accessibility,
but provide new connections to the region’s growing sidewalk network.

 3. Sidewalk Network Improvements with METRO RTA and PARTA
Strategies:
The ATP encourages Greater Akron area communities to work in close
concert with METRO RTA in Summit County and the Portage Area Regional
Transportation Authority (PARTA) in Portage County when developing new
sidewalk networks and when planning improvements to existing ones (See
Bus Stops Lacking Sidewalk Access map on page 20). The region’s communities
and transit authorities should:
🚶
🚶
🚶
🚶
🚶

Increase the number of bus stops with a sidewalk connection
Ensure that networks include pedestrian-friendly bus stops and
related amenities
Provide convenient transit access in those locations where there is
known heavy pedestrian traffic
Consider convenient pedestrian access when identifying new
transit connections and routes
Conduct in-depth, periodic analyses of bus stop locations and route
connections within the Greater Akron area

4. Seek a 100 Percent Participation Rate Among Greater Akron
Area School Districts in the Ohio Safe Routes to Schools (SRTS)
Program
Strategies:

AMATS encourages all area communities to:
🚶
🚶
🚶

Participate in the Ohio SRTS Program
Craft individualized School Travel Plans (STPs)
Provide clean sidewalk routes for students that walk to school

Funded by the FHWA and administered by ODOT, the SRTS Program
supports projects and programs that enable and encourage walking and
cycling to and from school. A School Travel Plan is a document outlining
a community’s plans for engaging students in active transportation, i.e.,
walking or cycling, as they travel to and from school. Plans are required for
funding requests made through the SRTS Program.
The ATP recommends that the agency develop project scoring criteria
during the next regularly scheduled update of the AMATS Funding Policy
Guidelines that weighs whether project applications can demonstrate
pedestrian and cycling safety improvements near area schools. Such
project applications will be considered accordingly under forthcoming
scoring criteria. Communities and project sponsors should be encouraged
by AMATS to prepare applications in cooperation with parents, local school
officials, and the SRTS Program. Such projects whose sponsors indicate that
planned projects have an express purpose to improve public safety will be
given precedence over others whose primary purpose is beautification or
historical preservation.
For more information about the SRTS Program, please visit http://www.
dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/Planning/ProgramManagement/HighwaySafety/
ActiveTransportation/Pages/Funds.aspx.

The ATP recommends that Greater Akron area communities provide highquality, safe bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure near schools. According
to publicschoolsk12.com, the Greater Akron area has a total of 52 school
districts including charter schools. Of that total, 15 school districts are
located within Portage County, 34 are within Summit County, and three are
within Wayne County.
Totals available from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT)
demonstrate the potential for increased participation by Greater Akron
area school districts in the SRTS Program. Currently, only nine area
districts are participating in the program. Of these districts, two – Aurora
and Streetsboro – are located in Portage County, six – Akron, Barberton,
Green, Hudson, Norton and Stow – are located in Summit County, and one
– Rittman – is located in Wayne County.

 CONCLUSION
The Greater Akron area has made tremendous strides in the pursuit of regional
connectivity since the Akron Metropolitan Area Transportation Study (AMATS)
launched its Connecting Communities Initiative in 2009 and its Connecting
Communities Planning Grant Program in 2010. In the years since, the area has
constructed new sidewalks, bike lanes, and shared-use paths and hosted many
events and public awareness campaigns to promote cycling and walking as safe
and vibrant means of transportation.
These AMATS-led initiatives also heralded a new approach to regional
transportation planning by the agency and its member communities: Complete
street concepts became guiding principles throughout the planning process.
The Bike Plans and Pedestrian Plans developed by AMATS in the years soon
after the adoption of this approach represented the agency’s initial attempts
to promote connectivity among the region’s various cycling and pedestrian
networks.
The 2019 Active Transportation Plan (ATP) prepared by AMATS represents
something new yet again for transportation planning in the Greater Akron area.
The ATP presents a more holistic, cohesive vision – not only for the region’s
cycling and pedestrian networks – but also its transit and roadway networks.
Rather than viewing these networks as generally separate entities as has been
done in the past, the ATP urges area communities and project sponsors to
identify and pursue opportunities to link these networks to an even greater
extent for the benefit of all transportation users. The ATP clarifies the strategies
and defines the goals that AMATS will pursue to improve the accessibility,
efficiency and safety of the area’s networks, especially those pertaining to active
transportation such as cycling and walking.
The ATP will be a key component of the upcoming long-range Transportation
Outlook 2045 to be prepared by AMATS in its role as the designated metropolitan
planning organization for Portage and Summit counties and Chippewa and
Milton townships in Wayne County. The ATP’s goals of improved efficiency and
safety for cyclists and pedestrians and establishing dedicated levels of funding
for cycling and pedestrian networks are integral to the region’s promotion of
active living, sound economic development, and sustainability.

 APPENDIX A
Glossary of Terms
Active Transportation
Active transportation includes non-motorized transportation options such as walking and biking and is ideally linked with transit networks. The pursuit of
active transportation options that are realistic, affordable and convenient for all users would promote health, economic development, environmental and safety
benefits.

Active Transportation Plan (ATP)
A comprehensive set of strategies to ensure better options for biking, walking and transit. ATPs include recommendations for prioritizing infrastructure
improvements and outline recommendations for new policies, processes, and infrastructure based on public and stakeholder input.

Accessible Pedestrian Signal (APS)
This is a traffic signal that provides auditory and/or vibrotactile information to pedestrians who are blind or have low vision.

Bicycle Facilities
A general term denoting improvements and provisions made by public agencies to accommodate or encourage bicycling, including parking and storage facilities,
and shared roadways not specifically designated for bicycle use.

Bike Lane
This is a dedicated lane for bicyclists that is separated from motor vehicle traffic by pavement markings and is signed for preferential or exclusive use by
bicyclists. Bike lane widths can range from 4 to 6 feet and should be striped, signed, and marked in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD).

Bike-N-Brainstorm
A public outreach tool used by AMATS to engage cyclists with the aim of improving the Greater Akron area’s biking infrastructure. AMATS encourages and
hosts these events which include a bike ride along a predetermined route followed by a discussion among participants regarding how communities may
improve their bike networks and related amenities.

Bike Route
This is a system of bikeways designated by the jurisdiction having authority that includes appropriate directional and informational route markers. Bike routes
can be an option where room does not permit or the need does not exist to create additional pavement width for cyclists. Bike routes are typically found on
low volume, low speed streets. They are especially helpful in way finding to link neighborhoods with networks of greenways and other types of bike facilities.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

23

 Bikeway
A generic term for any road, street, path or way which in some manner is specifically designated for bicycle travel, regardless of whether such facilities are
designated for the exclusive use of bicycles or are to be shared with other transportation modes.

Bump Out
“Bump outs,” also known as curb extensions or bulb-outs, extend the sidewalk space into the street and provide benefits to pedestrians by shortening the
crossing distance and improving visibility for both pedestrians and vehicles.

Chicane
This is a type of traffic-calming strategy to reduce the speed of vehicles for safety. Chicanes are created by installing a series of staggered mid-block bump-outs
on alternating sides of the street. On two-way streets, chicanes can either deflect both lanes or narrow the roadway to one lane used by both directions.

Connecting Communities Program
The AMATS Connecting Communities Program encourages the pursuit of vibrant livable areas by helping communities strike a balance between their land use
decisions and transportation investments. The grant program supports community studies that promote alternative forms of transportation to motor vehicles
such as walking and cycling.

Connectivity
This term refers to the extent to which urban forms permit or restrict movement of people or vehicles in different directions. Connectivity is generally considered
a positive attribute of an urban design, as it permits ease of movement and avoids severing neighborhoods. Urban forms which lack connectivity, e.g., those
severed by arterial roads or with many long cul-de-sacs, are considered to discourage movement on foot and encourage longer journeys by car. (This concept
is also occasionally referred to as “permeability.”)

Crosswalk
A place designated for pedestrians to cross a road. Crosswalks are designed to keep pedestrians together where they can be seen by motorists, and where they
can cross most safely across the flow of vehicular traffic.

Footpath
This is a type of thoroughfare that is intended for use only by pedestrians and excludes other forms of traffic such as motorized vehicles and cycles.

Geographic Information System (GIS)
A system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data.

Goat Path
A path created as a consequence of foot or bicycle traffic. The path usually represents the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and
destination. Width and erosion severity can be indicators of how much traffic a path receives. Goat paths emerge as shortcuts where constructed ways take a
circuitous route, have gaps, or are non-existent. (These paths are also known as a “desire line,” “social trail,” “cow path,” “goat track,” “pig trail” or “bootleg trail.”)

24

2019 Active Transportation Plan

 Green-Colored Pavement
This pavement was granted statewide interim approval for bike lanes to ODOT in 2011. Green-colored pavement within a bicycle lane increases the visibility
of the facility, identifies potential areas of conflict, and reinforces priority to bicyclists in conflict areas. The pavement may be installed within bicycle lanes as
a supplement to other pavement markings and is commonly applied at intersections, driveways, conflict areas, and along non-standard or enhanced facilities
such as cycle tracks. Motorists are expected to yield right of way to bicyclists at these locations.

Greenways and Park Trails
A greenway is a linear parcel of land set aside to preserve open space. Greenways are generally located in floodplain areas and along wooded stream corridors
that are unsuitable for development. Greenway and park trails typically are 8 to 10+ feet wide and may or may not be paved.

High-intensity Activated crossWalK
A traffic signal used to stop road traffic and allow pedestrians to cross safely. The beacon flashes yellow, then is steady yellow, then a steady red, then flashes red
to make drivers aware to stop. The purpose of a HAWK beacon is to allow protected pedestrian crossings, stopping road traffic only as needed. Where standard
traffic signal ‘warrants’ prevent the installation of standard three-color traffic signals, a HAWK provides an alternative. It is also known as a Pedestrian Hybrid
Beacon or “PHB.”

Jane’s Walk
This is an international walking initiative that provides opportunities for people to engage in city planning by meeting and exploring cities through short walking
tours. These tours usually culminate in discussions regarding how communities may improve their pedestrian networks. AMATS encourages and hosts Jane’s
Walk events throughout the Greater Akron area.

Leading Pedestrian Interval (LPI)
Signal timing that provides the walk signal several seconds before vehicles are given a green signal. LPI provides pedestrians with an advanced start so that
they are more visible in the crosswalk.

Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)
The Federal Highway Administration standards for signs, signals, and pavement markings.

Mid-Block Crossing
This is a crossing at non-intersection locations where marked crosswalks have been provided. Mid-block crosswalks can facilitate direct crossings to places that
people want to go, but which are not well served by an existing traffic network.

Pedestrian
This is a person traveling on foot, whether walking or running. For the purposes of this plan, those traveling using motorized scooters and wheelchair users are
considered as pedestrians.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

25

 Pedestrian Level of Service (LOS)
This is a measure that assesses the quality of the pedestrian experience through an analysis of sidewalk conditions, traffic volumes and speeds, and other
characteristics of the roadway.

Rail-Trail
A shared-use path, either paved or unpaved, built within the right-of-way of an existing or former railroad.

Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon (RRFB)
A beacon attached to the standard pedestrian crossing sign and activated by pedestrians.

Refuge Island
Also known as a pedestrian refuge or pedestrian island, is a small section of pavement or sidewalk, completely surrounded by asphalt or other road materials,
where pedestrians can stop before finishing crossing a road.

Right-of-Way
A general term denoting land, property or interest therein, usually in a strip acquired for or devoted to transportation purposes.

Right of Way
The right of one vehicle or pedestrian to proceed in a lawful manner in preference to another vehicle or pedestrian.

Road Diet
A road diet reduces the amount of space for motor vehicles, either through eliminating lanes or shrinking the width of lanes. The reclaimed space from a road
diet is then re-allocated for other uses, such as more sidewalk space or a pedestrian refuge island.

Roadway
The portion of the highway, including shoulders, intended for vehicular use.

Rumble Strips
A textured or grooved pavement sometimes used on or along shoulders of highways to alert motorists who stray onto the shoulder.

Safe Routes to School (SRTS)
This is a national movement to improve safety of walking and biking to school, improve pedestrian and bicycle access to schools, and encourage biking and
walking to school. SRTS includes state and federal funding programs as well as local programs.

Shared Roadway
This is a lane within a roadway that indicates that cyclists may be in the lane through sharrow pavement markings or other signage.

26

2019 Active Transportation Plan

 Shared-Use Path
A bikeway physically separated from motorized vehicular traffic by an open space or barrier and either within the highway right-of-way or within an independent
right-of-way. Shared-use paths may also be used by pedestrians, wheelchair users, and other non-motorized users. Shared use includes side paths and rail to
trails.

Sharrow
A shared lane pavement marking consisting of a bicycle symbol placed in the roadway lane that indicates that motorists should expect to see and share the lane
with bicycles. Unlike bicycle lanes, they do not designate a particular part of the roadway for the exclusive use of bicycles.

Shoulder
This is the portion of the roadway contiguous with the travel lane for accommodation of stopped vehicles, emergency use and for lateral support of sub-base,
base and surface courses. The shoulder is on the same level as the existing roadway surface.

Sidewalk
The portion of a street or highway right of-way designed for preferential or exclusive use by pedestrians. Generally, a sidewalk is paved path along the side of
a road. A sidewalk may accommodate moderate changes in grade (height) and is normally separated from the vehicular traffic by a curb. There may also be a
road verge, which is a strip of vegetation, grass, bushes or trees or a combination of these, more commonly referred to as a “Devil’s Strip” in Northeast Ohio,
either between the sidewalk and the roadway.

Signed Shared Roadway (Signed Bike Route)
This is a shared roadway which has been designated as a preferred route for bicycle use.

Thoroughfare
This is a road or street that connects one location to another.

Traffic Calming
Measures that consist of physical design, including narrowed roads and speed humps, put in place on roads for the intention of slowing down or reducing motorvehicle traffic and to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists.

Trail
This is a type of facility that is physically separated from motor vehicle traffic by an open space or barrier or is located in an independent right-of-way. Trails are
usually shared with other non-motorized users including pedestrians.

Transportation Alternatives Set Aside (TASA)
The TASA Program provides funding for bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Funding for TASA projects is assigned to MPO areas by Congress with ODOT suballocating a portion of its statewide TASA funding to Ohio MPOs. All TASA projects must relate to surface transportation and address a transportation need,
use, or benefit. Project categories include pedestrian and bicycle facilities including Safe Routes to School infrastructure projects.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

27

 Traveled Way
This is the portion of the roadway for the movement of vehicles, exclusive of shoulders.

Urban Design
This is the process of designing and shaping cities, towns and villages. Urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, streets and public spaces,
whole neighborhoods and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban areas functional, attractive, and sustainable.

Vertical Traffic Calming
Vertical traffic calming devices, such as speed bumps, speed humps and raised intersections, are devices that are placed in the middle of a road bed and require
vehicles to slow down to cross over them.

Vision Zero
Vision Zero is a national campaign to eliminate all traffic-related deaths and serious injuries. Local governments can elect to become a Vision Zero community
by setting clear goals for reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries, committing resources to achieving those goals, developing a plan or strategy around
those goals, and establishing a Vision Zero Task Force.

Walkability
A measure of how conducive an area is to walking. Walkability has many health, environmental, and economic benefits. Factors influencing walkability include
the presence or absence and quality of footpaths, sidewalks or other pedestrian rights-of-way, traffic and road conditions, land use patterns, building accessibility,
and safety, among others. Walkability is an important concept in sustainable urban design.

Walking Audit
This is an assessment of the walkability or pedestrian access of an external environment. Walking audits are often undertaken in street environments to consider
and promote the needs of pedestrians as a form of transport. They can be undertaken by a range of different stakeholders including: local community groups;
transportation planners/engineers; urban designers; local police officers; and local officials. Walking audits often collect both quantitative and qualitative data
on the walking environment.

Walk Friendly Community / Bike Friendly Community
Communities can gain designation as a Walk Friendly Community (through the Walk Friendly Communities Program) or as a Bike Friendly Community (through
the League for American Bicyclists). Both designations require communities to conduct a self-assessment about policies and programs that impact active
transportation. In addition to recognition, communities also receive feedback and resources to improve their local active transportation network and culture.

Walkshed
This is the land area within a defined walking range of a specified location such as a transit stop.

Wayﬁnding
Directional guidance for pedestrians, including signs, maps, and kiosks.

28

2019 Active Transportation Plan

 Wide Curb Lane Facility
Travel lane that is 14 feet or more, allowing a bicyclist to pass a four-wheel vehicle.

Zone System
In order to ensure that sidewalks are accessible to pedestrians, the FHWA promotes sidewalk dimensions based on a “zone system.” The zone system determines
the width of the sidewalk corridor and ensures that obstacles, such as newspaper boxes or telephone poles, do not limit pedestrian access. The four zones that
comprise this system are: the curb zone; the planter/furniture zone; the pedestrian zone; and the frontage zone. (This design system was initially developed by
the city of Portland, Oregon in its Portland Pedestrian Design Guide, 1998.)

 APPENDIX B
AMATS Planning Areas Deﬁned
To better illustrate the differences in context found within the communities that comprise the region, AMATS described eight “Planning Areas” – categorizations for
communities based on their dominant land use characteristics – in its 2010 Connecting Communities report. The eight categories are as follows:

Downtown

Urban
The Downtown area is the hub of the regional
transportation system. It supports high levels of public
transportation and pedestrian activity. It is the central
business district with dense, tall buildings and a mix of
office, residential, government and cultural uses.

Suburban Center

Urban areas are mature, developed neighborhoods
adjacent to the urban core area. They have both grid
and curving street patterns with moderate levels of
transit accessibility and pedestrian activity. They are
predominantly single-family with retail along main
streets and in small shopping centers.

Suburban

Suburban Centers are major business and retail hubs.
They consist of a mix of shopping centers, big-box stores
and office parks. Usually these areas are auto-dependent
and do not support transit and pedestrian activity.

Town Center

Suburban areas (suburbs) are predominantly singlefamily housing units with retail and business located in
shopping centers and office parks. Residential streets
are predominantly curved and terminate in cul-de-sacs.
Suburbs are auto-dependent with limited transit and
pedestrian activity.

Exurban
Town Centers are smaller hubs for business, retail,
residential and government uses predominantly along
main streets. These centers are pedestrian-friendly,
transit-accessible and can consist of both business and
office space.

Urban Core

Rural
Urban Core areas consist of a grid block street pattern
with high pedestrian activity and easy access to transit.
They provide a dense mix of single and multi-family
housing with businesses located along main streets and
corner stores.

30

Exurban areas (exurbs) are predominantly low-density
and single-family, with residential housing typically along
country roads or detached subdivisions surrounded by
agricultural and park land. They are auto-dependent,
without sidewalks and transit is limited to individual
door-to-door service.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

Rural areas consist of large tracts of agricultural, park
or vacant land. Housing is predominantly along country
roads and is very low-density and auto-dependent.
There are no sidewalks and transit is limited to individual
door-to-door service.

 APPENDIX C
Sidewalk Design Principles
TheCityFix, an online resource devoted to analysis on urban sustainability and development, published a 2015 article by Paula Manoela dos Santos, entitled, “The 8
Principles of the Sidewalk: Building More Active Cities.” This appendix is based on that article.

1. Proper Sizing
Sidewalks are made of up three zones: the free zone, where people actually
walk; the service zone, where street furniture like benches or trashcans are
located; and the transition zone, which gives those on the sidewalk access
to buildings lining the street. Understanding the relationship between these
components is key for designing appropriately sized sidewalks.

2. Quality Surfaces
The material used to construct sidewalks needs to be consistent, firm, stable
and slip-resistant. In order to ensure that a sidewalk functions properly,
designers must be aware of how the sidewalk is being constructed and the
quality of the handiwork.

3. Efficient Drainage
Waterlogged streets, paths, or sidewalks are unsuitable for walking.
Sidewalks that accumulate water become useless, as pedestrians will likely
end up diverting their route through car-filled roads, risking their safety.

4. Universal Accessibility
The sidewalk, as a public space, should be accessible to a wide spectrum of
users—including those with limited mobility. This means designing spaces
that serve those in wheelchairs, on crutches, pregnant women, the elderly,
and others with special mobility needs. Listing out the different potential
users and their mobility limitations during the design process can help
ensure the final product will meet the needs of all pedestrians.

5. Secure Connections
Pedestrians often transition to other modes of public transport and need to
be able to safely access stations. It’s important that sidewalks are connected
and integrated within larger transport networks.

6. Attractive Spaces
Streets are a fundamental part of the urban environment. Sidewalks can
play an important role in making the urban experience more enjoyable.
Interesting, vibrant sidewalks that can captivate people and make walking
more attractive will ultimately facilitate more physical activity while
reducing traffic congestion

7. Permanent Security
Day or night, weekday or weekend, sidewalks are always open for us.
However, there are fewer people out on foot during certain times of the day
and week, leading to potentially unsafe situations given the lack of friendly
eyes on the street. Adopting strategies to positively influence safety and
security can further encourage walking and help all city dwellers feel more
at home in their city.

8. Clear Signage
Just like drivers of motor vehicles, pedestrians need clear information so
that they can both orient themselves in the city and understand the rules
and guidelines of particular sidewalks.

2019 Active Transportation Plan

31

 APPENDIX D
Sidewalk Amenities and Infrastructure
Sidewalks are the most common form of walkway infrastructure and are exclusively for pedestrians, although some communities may opt to allow cyclists on sidewalks.
Sidewalks run parallel to a street or roadway and represent a sound infrastructure choice. They can be constructed in a variety of settings ranging from calm neighborhood
streets to busy arterials. The FHWA recommends that sidewalks be at least 5 feet in width if they are set back from a curb to allow two people to walk comfortably sideby-side. However, a sidewalk that is 6-feet wide or greater is sometimes preferred, especially in locations with heavy pedestrian traffic.
Sidewalk amenities and infrastructure can run the gamut from streetscape improvements to crossings. While the ATP encourages communities to pursue opportunities
to promote vibrant streetscapes along their sidewalk networks through the use of such amenities as street furniture, public art, and landscaping, these opportunities
should not take precedence over actual physical growth of their networks in the form of new sidewalks and crossings. The development of new and various types of
crossings represents a prime opportunity for the region to grow its pedestrian networks in terms of mileage. New crossings will also aid the region in its pursuit of
improved safety and connectivity. The ATP recommends that communities consider developing the following types of crossings:

32

🚶

High-Visibility Crosswalks/Pavement
The use of high-visibility materials at pedestrian crossings establishes a clear pedestrian domain and reinforces the potential presence of pedestrians to motorists.
High-visibility markings remove all doubt as to the legal domain of both pedestrians and motorists, resulting in the safe travel of both parties. Materials for highvisibility crosswalks can range from bright, reflective roadway striping to elaborately colored and patterned pavements.

🚶

Mid-Block Crosswalks
Mid-block crosswalks facilitate safe direct crossings to places that people want to go, but which are not well served by an existing traffic network. These facilities
minimize random “darting” across busy streets by pedestrians and alert motorists to be aware of their presence. The AMATS Mid-Block Crossing Analysis
compiled by the agency in 2014 identified 41 potential mid-block crossing locations throughout the Greater Akron area.

🚶

Pedestrian Bridges
A pedestrian bridge is a type of crossing for situations where the only safe option to cross a busy roadway, railroad, waterway, or other barrier is to travel over it.
Such bridges completely separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic.

🚶

Pedestrian Islands
A pedestrian island is a protected area that allows pedestrians to cross one direction of traffic at a time. This makes finding gaps in traffic easier on two-way
streets. Pedestrian islands differ from medians in that they are not continuous, but are only provided at the crossing location. Pedestrian island design ranges
from simple concrete pads in the middle of a road or intersection to lushly landscaped refuges incorporating beautiful design. Pedestrian islands also serve as a
traffic calming measure because they raise driver awareness of pedestrian activity and create a physical obstacle that slows passing traffic.

🚶

Raised Crosswalks
Raised crosswalks physically lift pedestrians to a height slightly above the roadway, increasing their visibility to oncoming drivers. Their elevation also serves as
a form of traffic calming, serving as speed bumps to slow vehicles down, thus creating a more comfortable atmosphere for pedestrians.

FROM:

AMATS Staff

RE:

Resolution 2019-16 - Approving Projects to be Funded under the Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program.
Resolution 2019-17 - Approving Projects to be Funded under the Resurfacing
program.
Resolution 2019-18 - Approving Projects to be Funded under the Transportation
Alternative Set Aside (TASA) program.

DATE:

December 4, 2019

The AMATS Policy Committee administers the STBG, Resurfacing and TASA funding
programs. These programs provide much needed funds for area highway, bike and pedestrian
projects. As part of administering these funds, the Policy Committee has assigned the TAC TIP
Subcommittee the responsibility to maintain a viable program and to make recommendations to
the Policy committee as needed. Staff assistance is provided to the TAC TIP Subcommittee in
performing these duties.
The TAC TIP Subcommittee met on October 22 to review recently submitted project
applications, apply approved evaluation criteria and develop a list of project recommendations
for STBG, Resurfacing and TASA programs. These projects will be added to the upcoming
2021-2024 Transportation Improvement Program or to the next one depending on the project
schedule. Sixty four applications were received from member communities totaling
approximately $79.3 million in requests for federal funds. However only 24 projects could be
funded with the $19.4 million of federal funds allocated to AMATS.
Project Funding Recommendations
Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG)
The attached Table 1 summarizes all 20 projects that were submitted under the STBG funding
program. Three projects, totaling nearly $9.7 million, are being recommended for funding and
are listed in bold type on the table. The project summaries include total project scores based on
criteria contained in AMATS Funding Policy Guidelines.
Resurfacing Program
The attached Table 2 summarizes all 30 projects that were submitted under the Resurfacing
program. Eighteen projects, totaling nearly $7.8 million, are being recommended for funding.
The project summaries also include total project scores.

 Transportation Alternatives Set Aside
The attached Table 3 summarizes all 13 projects that were submitted under the TASA funding
program. Three projects, totaling over $1.9 million are being recommended for funding.
Staff Comments
As with all AMATS project decisions, considerations with respect to public involvement,
financial capability, environmental justice, and air quality are important.
Public Involvement
One of the eligibility requirements for funding projects with AMATS suballocated funds is that
the project be included in the Regional Transportation Plan. All of the projects recommended for
funding are consistent with the Plan, which gives priority to preserving the existing
transportation system, and have therefore gone through public involvement in accordance with
AMATS Public Participation Plan.
This process includes a notification in the Akron Beacon Journal that these resolutions will be
presented for comment at a Citizens Involvement Committee meeting scheduled for December
12, 2019. Any comments on these projects will then be forwarded to the Policy Committee
meeting on December 19.
Financial Capability
Newly applied for projects will be programmed in fiscal years beyond the current TIP. In most
cases the new projects will be programmed in FY 2024, 2025, and 2026. Trading funds with
other MPO’s may be pursued to possibly advancing some projects.
Environmental Justice
These projects have gone through an environmental scan as part of the development of the
Regional Transportation Plan and do not to have any adverse environmental impacts on
minorities and/or low-income people.
Air Quality
Finally, these projects can be viewed as either exempt from air quality or have been analyzed as
part of the air quality networks and are in compliance with the Clean Air Act.
STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS
Attached to this memo are Resolution Numbers 2019-15, 2019-16 and 2019-17 approving
projects to be funded under the STBG, Resurfacing and TASA funding programs and included in
the upcoming Transportation Improvement Program FY 2021-2024 where applicable. The TAC
TIP Subcommittee and Staff recommend approval.

MEMORANDUM

Policy Committee
Technical Advisory Committee
Citizens Involvement Committee

FROM:

AMATS Staff

RE:

Resolution 2019-19 – Approving Changes to AMATS Committee Bylaws.

DATE:

December 4, 2019

The AMATS Policy Committee bylaws update was completed in 1988. Since that time, a
number of changes in terms of AMATS membership and terminology of committees have
changed.
As part of its agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation, AMATS commits to
maintaining a Prospectus document, which encloses all bylaws, member agreements, and policy
documents. In an attempt to update the Prospectus, the AMATS Staff felt that it should first
update the Policy Committee bylaws. The changes proposed to the bylaws represent
maintenance changes. These changes are described below:
 Member communities which did not exist in 1988 have been added.
 Added Wayne County Engineer’s Office to be consistent with existing structure.
 The CIC membership appointment has been removed as it has not been practiced
since the early 2000s.
 The TAC TIP Subcommittee name replaces an outdated name for this
subcommittee.
 The bylaw amendments incorporate revisions that the Policy Committee made to
the structure of the TAC TIP Subcommittee through the Funding Policy
Guidelines approved by the committee in June 2019.
The revised Policy Committee bylaws are included in this attachment. The Staff recommends
approval of Resolution 2019-19 updating the AMATS Policy Committee Bylaws.

 RESOLUTION NUMBER 2019-19
OF THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION POLICY COMMITTEE
OF THE AKRON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSPORTATION STUDY
APPROVING CHANGES TO AMATS COMMITTEE BYLAWS.
WHEREAS, the Akron Metropolitan Area Transportation Study (AMATS) is designated as the
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) by the Governor, acting through the Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT) and in cooperation with locally elected officials in
Summit and Portage counties and the Chippewa and Milton Township areas of Wayne County;
and
WHEREAS, this Committee, known as the AMATS Policy Committee, is responsible for
directing, coordinating and administering the transportation planning process in the Greater
Akron area in an efficient manner; and
WHEREAS, the Bylaws of the AMATS Policy Committee guide the committee in its mission;
and
WHEREAS, the AMATS Technical Staff acting on behalf of the AMATS Policy Committee
has reviewed the committee’s bylaws and identified needed changes to passages within the
bylaws; and
WHEREAS, the adoption of these bylaw changes would result in the improved operation and
functions of the committee and therefore aid the committee in its mission as the region’s
designated MPO; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
1.

That this Committee approves the proposed changes to the Bylaws of the AMATS Policy
Committee presented herein.

2.

That this Committee directs the AMATS Staff to transmit a copy of this resolution to the
United States Department of Transportation and the Ohio Department of Transportation
as evidence of this action by the AMATS Policy Committee.

RE:

Resolution 2019-21 – Approving Amendment #24 to the Transportation
Improvement Program FY 2018-2021 - To Add ODOT-Awarded Funds in
FY 2020 for METRO RTA and PARTA

DATE:

December 5, 2019

Executive Summary
This memorandum discusses a TIP amendment to the FY 2020 program of projects for METRO
RTA and PARTA to add recently awarded funding from ODOT.
The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) has awarded METRO RTA and PARTA
funding through its Ohio Transit Partnership Program (OTP2). This competitive grant program
was established to provide additional capital funding to Ohio’s public transit operators for
projects emphasizing system preservation. On October 28, 2019, METRO and PARTA were
both awarded funds through this program for inclusion in FY 2020 of the AMATS
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). METRO received $1,042,000. PARTA received
$1,031,152. The source of the OTP2 funds is State of Ohio General Revenue Funds (GRF).
In addition, ODOT awards funds annually through its Urban Transit Program (UTP). These
funds are generally used to help match federal funds. For FY 2020, ODOT awarded $1,007,281
to METRO, and $234,773 to PARTA. The source of the UTP funds is likewise state GRF funds.
PARTA was also awarded $139,400 in Elderly & Disabled fare assistance funding.
Consequently, METRO and PARTA are requesting that these additional funds be added to the
TIP to include the recently awarded OTP2, UTP and E&D funded projects. OTP2 and UTP
funds will be used for the maintenance of METRO’s and PARTA’s capital assets. E&D funding
is used for passenger fare assistance.
METRO is requesting the following changes to the TIP:
- Revise Capital Funds for the Purchase of Cameras and Surveillance Equipment (PID
111275)
The amendment to this existing project reduces the amount of FTA Section 5307 funding
by $430,000 (the UTP award amount). This project is for the acquisition of camera

 equipment, to replace existing video and camera hardware on all of METRO revenue
vehicles, resulting in a new FTA 5307 amount of $410,000. METRO also intends to use
state funds in the amount of $360,000 from the OTP2 award to replace METRO’s local
share. The total project cost remains $1,200,000.
- Revise Capital Funds for the Purchase of Radio Equipment (PID 111275)
METRO intends to reduce FTA 5307 funding in the amount of $280,000 (the amount
awarded through the UTP and OTP2 programs) for the acquisition of radio equipment on
all METRO vehicles. This action brings the new FTA 5307 total to $280,000. METRO
plans to use state funds in the amount of $300,000 from the OTP2 award to replace
METRO’s local funding and $220,000 from the UTP award for the reduction of 5307
funds. The total project cost remains $800,000. This project is intended to maintain
METRO’s existing vehicle fleet by modernizing and replacing existing capital
equipment.
- Revise and Add Capital Funds for the Purchase of NEORide IT Hardware (PID 111275)
This project incorporates newly awarded state OTP2 funds from NEORide in the amount
of $210,000 to purchase IT equipment. This new funding will replace existing FTA 5307
funds in the amount of $140,000. The IT hardware equipment is designed to improve
METRO’s WiFi capability. This project is part of a project to coordinate services across
multiple transit agencies throughout the state, coordinated through a council of
governments (COG), designated NEORide. The NEORide COG is comprised of a
number of transit agencies in the state, including METRO RTA and PARTA.
- Add Capital Funds for the Purchase of NEORide Validators (PID 111499)
METRO has been awarded $613,909 in state GRF funds through the OTP2 Program and
is requesting the purchase of mobile fare collection validator equipment. Funds will be
issued at 100% state funding, programmed in FY 2020. This project is part of a larger
$3,306,790 project to coordinate services across multiple transit agencies throughout the
state, coordinated through a council of governments, designated NEORide.
- Revise Capital Funds for the Acquisition of Non-Revenue Support Vehicles (PID 111275)
METRO RTA intends to use $42,000 in ODOT-awarded OTP2 funds for the acquisition
of non-revenue support vehicles, replacing the local funds of the same amount. The FTA
5307 amount remains unchanged and the total project cost remains $140,000.
- Revise Capital Funds for the Construction of Bus Shelters (PID 111279)
This project will incorporate newly awarded state funds for the acquisition, engineering
and construction of multiple replacement bus stops throughout Summit County. METRO
plans to use state UTP funds in the amount $350,000 to replace federal FTA 5307 and
local funding. The total project cost remains $500,000.
- Revise Funds for Planning Studies (PID 111278)

2

 METRO requests the use $240,000 in state-awarded OTP2 funds for a number of
planning feasibility studies. This amendment reduces the local funding amount by the
same amount bringing the new local total to $162,000. The federal amount (FTA 5307
funds) remains unchanged. The total project cost remains $1,340,000.
PARTA is requesting the following changes to the TIP:
- Revise Capital Funds for the Preventive Maintenance of Vehicles and Bus Facilities (PID
104390)
This existing project is intended to maintain PARTA’s vehicle fleet and its bus facilities
and transfer locations. PARTA would like to revise the sources of funding for their
preventive maintenance budget as a result of funds awarded in the amount of $640,000
through the OTP2 Program in FY 2020. The total project cost will be approximately
$1,674,773. The project includes the use of $234,773 in state UTP funds. PARTA local
share funding will be removed from this project.
- Add Capital Funds for the Purchase of NEORIDE Validators (PID 111499)
PARTA has been awarded $189,999 in state GRF funds through the OTP2 Program and
requests the purchase of mobile ticket validator equipment for passenger fare collection.
The total project cost is $189,999. Funds will be issued at 100% state funding,
programmed in FY 2020. This project is part of a larger $3,306,790 project to coordinate
services across multiple transit agencies throughout the state, coordinated through a
council of governments (COG), called NEORide. The NEORide COG is comprised of a
number of transit agencies in the state, including METRO RTA and PARTA.
- Perform Administrative Modifications to Three Existing Projects to Include OTP2 Funds
PARTA will add OTP2 funds to the following projects to replace or augment the local
share:
 Bus Storage Facility (PID 104386) - $354,260
 Maintenance Equipment (PID 111292) - $26,892
 Support Vehicles (PID 111292) - $10,000
STAFF COMMENTS
As with all TIP amendments, considerations with respect to consistency with the Regional
Transportation Plan, financial capability, air quality conformity, public involvement, and
environmental justice are important.
Regional Transportation Plan
The project proposed in this amendment is consistent with Transportation Outlook, the area’s
Regional Transportation Plan.

3

 Financial Capability
With respect to financial capability, there are sufficient funds available for this amendment.
Air Quality
The project can be viewed as either exempt from air quality or has been analyzed as part of the
air quality networks and has resulted in a finding of compliance with the Clean Air Act.
Therefore, this amendment will not affect adversely the air quality conformity approval of
Transportation Outlook or the TIP.
Public Involvement
The Staff is recommending that the Policy Committee consider this action as not regionally
significant. As a result, the modified procedures in the AMATS Public Participation Plan are
appropriate.
Environmental Justice
Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low Income Populations states that, “each federal agency shall make achieving
environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing as appropriate,
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs
policies and activities on minority and low-income populations.” This requirement also applies
to recipients of federal funds, such as METRO RTA and PARTA.
The project that will result from this TIP amendment does not appear to impose
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minorities and/or
low-income people who reside in the METRO RTA or PARTA service areas.
STAFF RECOMMENDATION
Attached to this memo is Resolution 2019-21. This resolution approves the requested changes to
FY 2020 of the TIP as described above. The Staff recommends approval.

AMATS Staff

RE:

Resolution 2019-22 – Approving the AMATS Area Traffic Crash Analysis
Technical Memorandum and Support for ODOT Safety Goals

DATE:

December 5, 2019

Executive Summary
The purpose of this resolution is to approve the AMATS area Traffic Crash Analysis Technical
Memorandum, as well as give support for ODOT safety performance targets for calendar year
2020.

Traffic Crash Analysis Technical Memorandum
Attached please find the AMATS area Traffic Crashes and Safety Performance Measures (20162018) Technical Memorandum. All crashes that occurred on non-freeway roadways in the
AMATS study area were considered for analysis. All the segments and intersections that meet
the minimum criteria are ranked and listed. Crash locations are also sorted and listed by
community on the AMATS website.
The second section of the crash memo focuses on bicycle and pedestrian crashes. These crashes
tend to occur more randomly and are usually not concentrated at specific locations. Therefore
this section of the memo is trend oriented and highlights some of the characteristics of bicycle
and pedestrian crashes.
The third section in the crash report is performance oriented. It describes safety performance
measures that MPOs are now required to set and attain. In this section base values and current
values are compared using five years of data.
The last section is a list of all the high crash segments and intersections along with the
corresponding maps.
The Staff requests that the attached technical memorandum be approved as noted in the attached
resolution. Once this memorandum has been approved, local governments may use it as an
initial step in the process of applying for Highway Safety Program funds through ODOT.

 More detailed information about crashes may be requested, including bicycle and pedestrian, at
any specific location.
Background on Performance Measures
Current federal legislation and guidance features an emphasis on performance measurement.
This focus is consistent with AMATS goals and objectives, which promote the transparency of
public data and decision-making and seeks to improve the accountability of public spending by
better linking investments to outcomes.
Performance measures are central to implementing a Performance-Based Planning Process
(PBPP) that guides decision making. How performance is defined and measured can
significantly affect the types of projects and strategies that are advanced by decision makers.
Moreover, performance results inform agencies whether the types of projects and strategies they
are implementing are in fact helping them achieve their goals. Performance measures aim to
answer questions about whether the performance of the transportation system is getting better or
worse over time. Performance measures also aim to demonstrate whether transportation
investments are correlated or linked to stated goals and whether they produce desired outcomes.
Introducing a performance management approach to planning is intended to improve project and
program delivery, inform investment decision making, focus staff efforts on priorities, and
provide greater transparency and accountability to the public. Current federal guidelines apply
performance measurement at the programmatic, rather than project level and link performance
measures and targets to funding decisions by way of performance-based funding. The purpose
of this approach is to move towards performance-based decision-making for project selection in
the future.
The US DOT and ODOT continue to develop performance targets in consultation with MPOs
like AMATS, and others. State investments must make progress toward these performance
targets, and MPOs must incorporate these performance measures and targets into their
Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) and long range Regional Transportation Plans.
Federal guidance imposes financial penalties on states that fail to make progress toward these
performance goals.
There are seven areas for which the US DOT has established national performance goals. These
areas are:








Safety
Infrastructure Condition
Congestion Reduction
System Reliability
Freight Movement and Economic Vitality
Environmental Sustainability
Reduced Project Delivery Delays

2

 To implement performance measure goals, US DOT has developed measures and minimum
standards for states to follow. In the transportation planning process, the public and other
stakeholders articulate a strategic direction that is based on a shared vision for the future.




Goals and Objectives stem from the area's vision and goals, and they address
key desired outcomes. Agencies like AMATS create objectives—which are
specific, measurable statements—that shape planning priorities.
Performance Measures support objectives and are the basis for comparing
alternative improvement strategies, investment and policy strategies, and
tracking results.

Driven by data on performance, along with public involvement and policy considerations,
AMATS conducts analyses that inform investment and policy priorities.






Identify Trends and Targets – Trends and targets let agencies compare
alternative strategies. This step relies on baseline data from past trends, tools
to forecast future performance, and information on possible strategies,
available funding, and other constraints.
Identify Strategies and Analyze Alternatives –Scenario analysis may also
be used to compare alternative strategies and funding levels, or to explore
funding levels required to achieve certain performance goals.
Develop Investment Priorities – To reach investment targets, AMATS will
create a TIP and a Regional Transportation Plan that consider priorities and
tradeoffs.

Programming involves selecting specific projects to include in the TIP. In a performance based
planning approach, agencies make programming decisions based on whether those decisions
support performance targets or contribute to desired trends.
Performance based planning is founded on evidence that the process leads agencies to their
goals. The following evaluation activities happen throughout implementation and when needed
throughout performance based planning.




Monitoring – Gathering information on actual conditions.
Evaluation – Conducting analysis to understand whether implemented
strategies have been effective.
Reporting – Communicating information about system performance and
whether policymakers, stakeholders, and the public think plans and programs
are effective.

In a performance based planning approach, each step in the process is clearly connected to the
next so that goals translate into specific measures. Those measures then become the basis for
selecting and analyzing strategies for the long range plan. Ultimately, project selection decisions
are influenced by expected performance returns. Keeping the next step in the process in mind is
critical to each step along the way.

3

 Safety Target Setting and Coordination
Federal legislation requires MPOs like AMATS to establish performance targets and set targets
that demonstrate fatal and serious injury reductions on all public roads. The required
performance measures for safety are:






Number of fatalities
Fatality rate
Number of serious injuries
Serious injury rate
Number of non-motorized fatalities and serious injuries

In accordance with federal legislation, AMATS used a five-year average to calculate baseline
safety statistics. These baseline figures are the benchmarks to which all future calculations will
be compared. All future values will also be calculated using five years of data. This five-year
rolling average is used to smooth out short-term year-to-year fluctuations. A full discussion of
safety planning and the identification of safety needs for the AMATS area can be found in the
attached traffic crash technical memorandum, discussed above. As noted, this memorandum also
includes analyses of bicycle and pedestrian safety data.
After reviewing historical crash trends, external factors and through consultation with the state’s
MPOs, ODOT established a 1 percent annual reduction target across all five safety categories
statewide. ODOT developed a baseline using calendar year (CY) 2013-2017 for setting the CY
2019 safety targets. The FHWA will determine whether a state DOT has met or made significant
progress toward meeting its CY 2019 targets in December 2020. A state is considered to have
met or made significant progress if at least four of the five targets are better than the baseline.
The CY 2019 highway safety targets for Ohio are:
• 1,062 fatalities
• 8,834 serious injuries
• 0.91 fatality rate
• 7.60 serious injury rate
• 836 non-motorized fatalities and non-motorized serious injuries
AMATS is also required to establish safety performance targets. There are two options available
for satisfying this requirement: commit to a quantifiable target for each measure within the
metropolitan area, or approve of ODOT’s statewide targets and agree to plan and program
projects so that they contribute toward the accomplishment of these targets. For CY 2019
AMATS decided to support the goals set forth by ODOT for the entire state, rather than develop
separate targets for our area (See AMATS Policy Resolution 2018-17, approved in September
2018).

 ODOT’s Calculated Targets for CY 2020
After reviewing historical crash trends, external factors, and through consultation with ODOT's
partners, the Strategic Highway Safety Plan Steering Committee recommended that Ohio set a 2
percent annual reduction target across all five categories.
Although the 2% annual target will be difficult to achieve across all five categories, the Safety
Steering Committee concluded that an aspirational but achievable target is better than adopting
targets that accept the status quo.
ODOT has adopted the 2% annual reduction target based on the state’s commitment to safety.
This commitment includes the following new initiatives:





An additional $50 million annually for ODOT’s Highway Safety Program
The statewide implementation of centerline rumble strips
Ohio Department of Public Safety (ODPS) young driver and driver training initiatives
Ten million dollars for a new pedestrian safety improvement program

Below are Ohio's CY 2020 targets. The baseline years for setting CY 2020 targets are CY 20142018. The Federal Highway Administration will determine whether a state DOT has met or made
significant progress toward meeting its CY 2020 targets in December 2021. States will be
notified in March 2022.
A state is considered to have met or made significant progress toward meeting its performance
targets if at least four of the five targets have been met or the actual outcome for the target is
better than the baseline performance.
CY 2020 Targets for Ohio are:
 1,055 fatalities
 8,348 serious injuries
 0.91 fatality rate
 7.21 serious injury rate
 824 non-motorized fatalities and non-motorized serious injuries
Baselines used to set targets are (CY 2014-2018):
 1,099 fatalities
 8,692.2 serious injuries
 0.95 fatality rate
 7.51 serious injury rate
 858.4 non-motorized fatalities and non-motorized serious injuries
Although we have not reached the end of calendar year 2019, ODOT is projecting that the state
will have 1,130 fatalities by the end of the year. Actual safety data for CY 2019 will not be
available until next spring (April 2020).

 The staff is recommending that the Policy Committee support ODOT’s statewide 2 percent
annual reduction target for all five safety performance measures in CY 2020.
Staff Recommendation
Attached is Resolution 2019-22 for your review and consideration. This resolution approves the
attached AMATS area Traffic Crash Analysis Technical Memorandum, as well as support for
ODOT’s safety performance targets. The staff recommends approval of this resolution.

Section 1: All Crashes
Overview
The 2016-2018 Crash Report was prepared by reviewing 55,860 crash records obtained from the Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT). Animal crashes and construction zone crashes were removed and not
included in the analysis since they do not relate to the characteristics of the roadway. The data is then imported in
into GIS and plotted. It is carefully checked for location accuracy and then categorized as segment or intersection
crashes. In Section 1 of this report the roadway segment and intersection locations are further analyzed and then
ranked. In Section 2 Bicycle and Pedestrian Related Crashes are discussed. Section 3 highlights Safety
Performance Measures and Targets. Freeway crashes are not included in this report and instead are analyzed
and ranked by the Ohio Department of Transportation.
Trends
In 2018 the overall number of crashes in the AMATS area decreased by 90. This is a 0.5% decrease from
2017. Injury crashes decreased by 38 or 0.8% and fatal crashes were significantly down by 20 or 39%.
The following graph shows the number of total crashes in the AMATS area between 2008 and 2018. The red line
at the top shows thousands of daily vehicle miles traveled (kDVMT) in the AMATS area. This data was obtained
from the ODOT Office of Technical Services. In 2018 kDVMT decreased by 3.9% from 2017.

 Methodology
The 2016-2018 Crash Report used Geographical Information System (GIS) coordinates to plot crashes.
Sometimes the coordinates are not correct and crashes have to be manually moved to their proper location based
on the description on the police report. This is time consuming but necessary for an accurate report.
Another challenge is determining if a crash should be considered segment or intersection related. Not all crashes
that occur near an intersection are classified as intersection related. An example would be a single vehicle
departing the roadway and hitting a tree at a location that just happens to be near an intersection. If the
intersecting street is used as a reference the crash appears to be intersection related when in reality it wasn’t.
Most of the time the police officer’s crash report must be reviewed to gain a better understanding of these types of
crashes. The final decision is based on the location of the vehicles and the nature of the crash.
Once crashes are properly identified as intersection or segment related, the crash is assigned a unique
identification number for sorting of the crashes. The final step in GIS is to sum up all the crashes that occur within
each unique intersection or segment.
Once the analysis in GIS was done, a list of high crash segments and intersections is produced.



The high crash criterion for roadway sections is 10 or more crashes per mile per year.
The high crash criterion for intersections is 10 or more crashes in the three-year period.

Once this initial group of high crash locations is identified based on number of crashes a crash rate is calculated.
The crash rate takes into account the average daily traffic volume. For example, ten crashes per year at a
location that averages 1,000 vehicles per day has a worse crash rate than ten crashes per year at a location that
averages 30,000 vehicles per day. The formulas for crashes per mile and crash rate are given in Appendix A.


A minimum crash rate of 1.0 is required for both roadway sections and intersections to be included in the
list of high crash locations.

Next the severity index is calculated for locations that meet the minimum number of crashes and crash rate.
The severity index is a ratio of how many fatal and injury crashes occur compared to total crashes. This measure
is useful when determining which locations should have priority in order to not only reduce crashes but to also
reduce fatalities and injuries. The formula for severity index is given in the Appendix A.
Finally a composite score is calculated based on how a location ranks according to number of crashes, crash rate
and severity index. The formula for composite score is given in Appendix A. This score defines the final rank of
the location.
High Crash Sections
A “section” is defined as a length of roadway between two logical termini such as intersections with other
roadways. The length of a section is usually shorter in urban areas and could be miles long in a rural area. All
roads in the AMATS area were considered, including those that are not federally classified.


AMATS identified 179 high crash roadway sections that have 10 or more crashes per mile per year and a
crash rate of one or more over the three year period.



Table 5-1 lists the 179 high crash roadway sections ranked by composite score. The table also notes if
any crashes were bike or pedestrian related. Map 5-1 shows the top 50 high crash roadway sections.

3

 High Crash Intersections
Crashes that occur within a radius of 250 feet from the center of an intersection and involve at least two vehicles
are usually considered an intersection related crash. Exceptions to this rule were driveway related crashes and
crashes that had non-intersection characteristics such as departing intersection. All intersections in the AMATS
area were considered, including those of roads that are not federally classified.


AMATS identified 311 intersections that have a minimum of 10 crashes and a crash rate of one or more
over the three year period.



Table 5-2 lists the 311 high crash intersections ranked by composite score. The table also notes if any
crashes were bike or pedestrian related. Map 5-2 shows the top 50 high crash intersections.

The number one and two ranked intersections in the 2016-2018 Crash Report are
next to each other in Akron. S Maple St and Rhodes Ave (1) and S Maple St and
Cedar St (2). This is the second year in a row that these intersections were ranked
first and second.

High Crash Freeway Locations
The analysis of freeway crashes in the AMATS area is done by the central office of the Ohio Department of
Transportation (ODOT) in Columbus. ODOT’s analysis of freeways is done using methodology from the Highway
Safety Manual. The freeway system is divided into rural and urban and is analyzed by examining segments that
are one-tenth of a mile long. ODOT only considers the top 50 rural and top 50 urban locations statewide for
further study. For further information about top freeway crash locations along with other 2018 HSIP Priority
Locations from ODOT please follow the following link.

 Section 2: Bicycle and Pedestrian Crashes
Overview
As biking and walking becomes a more popular and viable means of transportation, there is growing concern
about the safety of bike riders and pedestrians. Determining how and where these incidents occur can help plan
for future bike lanes, sidewalks, lighting, and educational outreach. Bike and pedestrian related crashes tend to
happen more randomly and usually do not have the characteristic of being concentrated at specific locations like
other vehicular crashes. Because of this it is sometimes more practical to make improvements to a corridor rather
than a specific location.
The Ohio Revised Code considers a bicycle a slow moving vehicle and generally speaking is subject to the same
laws and responsibilities as a motor vehicle. Bike riders can be issued a citation if they are guilty of breaking
traffic laws. Local governments have the ability to make some of their own rules and laws which may be
inconsistent between communities.
Education is an important tool to help curb bike and pedestrian related crashes. Appendix B has bike and
pedestrian safety tips to help with this education. Many bike riders and pedestrians, especially those under the
driving age, may not be aware of the rules that they must observe. Appendix C shows School Bus Stopping Laws
as this can impact many pedestrians and drivers.
Bike and pedestrian related crashes have a high percentage of injuries.



Out of the 248 bicycle related crashes that occurred between 2016 and 2018, 187 of them or 75% resulted
in an injury and three of them in a fatality. There were no fatal bike crashes in 2017.



There were 477 pedestrian related crashes in this same time period with 394 or 83% of them resulting in
an injury and 17 of them in a fatality.

By comparison about 23% of all vehicular crashes for the same three year period resulted in an injury.
Bicycle Related Crashes
In 2018 total bicycle related crashes decreased by 8 and injuries related decreased by 6. There was 1 fatal
bicycle related crashes in 2018.

 Most bicycle related crashes occur at intersections (62%). Also, most crashes occur in summer and early fall
when bike riding conditions are most favorable. Many bicycle riders, especially younger ones, do not obey stop
signs and traffic signals. Often a vehicle does not see a bicycle because of their narrow profile and turns into it or
pulls in front of it. Many times a driver is not expecting a bicycle in the crosswalk or misjudges its approach
speed. If a bicycle rider is biking against traffic a driver may not look that direction when turning into or pulling out
of another street or driveway. Map 5-3 shows where the bicycle related crashes occurred in the AMATS area.

Pedestrian crashes occur almost evenly at intersections and mid-block. Pedestrians are at fault in a majority of
the mid-block crashes while vehicles are at fault in most intersection crashes. In many crashes the pedestrian
darts out in front of the vehicle. Many intersection-related pedestrian crashes occurred when a vehicle was
making a turn or a pedestrian was crossing the street against the signal. Map 5-4 shows where pedestrian
related crashes occurred in the AMATS area.

 The following graph shows the month that pedestrian related crashes occurred. October is traditionally the month
with the most incidents. One might think that most of these incidents occur around Halloween; however, after
examining the data closer look we found that they are spread out throughout the month. One speculation about
why October has the most incidents is the decreasing amount of daylight while the weather is still reasonably
nice. Pedestrians are still active but are harder to see in darkness even if streetlights are present.

 Section 3: Safety Performance Measures and Targets
Safety performance management is part of the overall Transportation Performance Management (TPM) program.
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is requiring state DOTs and agencies like AMATS to develop a
strategic approach that uses system information to make investment and policy decisions in order to achieve
national performance goals.
Recent federal legislation requires ODOT and AMATS to establish performance measures and set targets that
demonstrate fatal and serious injury reductions on all public roads. The required performance measures for
safety are:
•
•
•
•
•

Number of fatalities
Fatality rate
Number of serious injuries
Serious injury rate
Number of non-motorized fatalities and serious injuries

AMATS is required to establish safety performance measures. There are two options available for satisfying this
requirement: commit to a quantifiable target for each measure within the metropolitan area, or approve of ODOT’s
statewide targets and agree to plan and program projects so that they contribute toward the accomplishment of
those goals. AMATS is committed to support the goals set forth by ODOT for the entire state, rather that develop
separate targets and goals for our area.
After reviewing historical crash trends, external factors and through consultation with the state’s Metropolitan
Planning Organizations (MPOs), ODOT is recommending a 2 percent annual reduction target across all five
safety categories. A state is considered to have met or made significant progress if at least four of the five targets
are better than the baseline.
In accordance with federal regulations, AMATS used a five-year average to calculate the initial safety targets in
2015. These averages will become the benchmark to which all future calculations will be compared. All future
values will also be calculated using five years of data. This five-year rolling average is used to smooth out short
term year-to-year fluctuations in data.
The table below shows the calculation of the AMATS rolling averages for the five safety performance measures.
The 2015 averages are the benchmark values that the 2018 values are compared to. In three out of the five
safety performance measures AMATS has far exceeded the ODOT goal of reducing each category by one
percent, when compared to 2015 averages. All 5 categories have improved from 2017 to 2018.

 APPENDIX B – Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Tips
Safety Tips for Drivers Encountering Bike Riders






Bicyclists are required to ride as far to the right of the road as practicable, but are legally permitted to
utilize the full traffic lane when necessary to protect their own safety.
Bicyclists should be treated like any other slow-moving vehicle: they should only be passed when there
are no oncoming cars and sight lines are clear. When passing a bicyclist, ensure there is a minimum of
3 feet between your car and the bicycle.
Beware of bicyclists who might be in your blind spot or are otherwise difficult to see.
Exercise extra caution when approaching children on bikes and at multi-use path crossings.

Safety Tips for Bike Riders







Bicyclists are required to follow the same rules of the road as other drivers: stop at stop signs and red
lights, and ride in the same direction as other traffic.
Bicyclists should position themselves at least a few feet from the curb, and should especially avoid
riding in the gutter. When parked cars are present, steer clear of the “door zone”.
Bicyclists should not weave in and out of traffic or pass queued traffic at a stop sign or traffic light,
unless a bike lane is provided.
In most cases, bicyclists should not ride on sidewalks. This is especially important in urban areas, as
motorists are less likely to see bicyclists behind parked cars, street trees, and other obstacles.
Bicyclists should yield to pedestrians at crosswalks and on multi-use paths and sidewalks (where
sidewalk riding is permitted).
Bicyclists can promote safe interactions with motorists by being courteous yet assertive. Examples
include riding single file or pulling over when cars are backed up behind your group, using hand signals
and making eye contact, and using the full lane when it is unsafe for cars to pass.

Safety Tips for Drivers Encountering Pedestrians




Drivers must yield the right of way to pedestrians crossing in marked or unmarked crosswalks (there is
technically a crosswalk at every street or road intersection, even if it’s not marked).
At signals, drivers must yield to pedestrians when the WALK signal is displayed.
Distracted driving is an increasingly common cause of crashes and poses particular concerns for
pedestrians, who are often less visible and more susceptible to injury than other motorists.

Safety Tips for Pedestrians









Pedestrians must cross at intersections or midblock crosswalks.
Pedestrians must obey WALK/DON’T WALK signals where provided, and otherwise cross with the
green light. A flashing DON’T WALK signal indicates that it is too late to begin crossing, but that if
already in the crosswalk, you should continue walking to the other side.
Pedestrian distraction is just as dangerous as driver distraction. Pedestrians should turn off their
handheld devices, mp3 players, etc. when crossing the street or walking in busy areas.
Pedestrians generally should not assume that they are visible to drivers, or that drivers will follow the
rules of the road.
Pedestrians should give drivers plenty of time to stop before entering a crosswalk.
When a sidewalk is not available, pedestrians should walk facing traffic.
At night, pedestrians should wear reflective clothing and also consider using flashing lights.

AKRON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSPORTATION STUDY
MEMORANDUM
TO:

Policy Committee
Technical Advisory Committee
Citizens Involvement Committee

FROM:

AMATS Staff

RE:

Resolution 2019-23 Approving Amendment #25 to the Transportation
Improvement Program FY 2018-2021 to add additional funding to an existing
project.

DATE:

December 4, 2019

The City of Stow has recently requested an additional $100,000 of TASA funds for the right of
way phase of the SR 91 Sidewalks project (PID 107814). This is a TASA project that was
approved by AMATS in the 2017 round of funding. The project calls for construction of new
sidewalks along SR 91 in Stow. The project is 1.60 miles long and begins 500 feet south of
Conwill Road and ends 375 feet south of Fishcreek Road. The Final right of way plans will be
submitted in about two weeks and the current cost estimate is $175,000-$200,000. ODOT
requires the full right of way acquisition process which is $4000- $4500 per parcel plus
settlement cost. Stow is short a minimum of $100,000. The current funding is $74,131 for right
of way in FY 2020 and $516,050 for construction in FY 2021. If the additional $100,000 is
approved the total TASA funding will be $690,181 which is under the TASA maximum of
$700,000. There is currently a balance of $455,345 in TASA funds for FY 2020. Stow plans to
start the right of way acquisition process soon after the first of the year and it will take nine
months to a year to complete. This additional funding has been presented to the TAC TIP
Subcommittee on Tuesday December 3rd. The TAC TIP Subcommittee approved the additional
funding.
STAFF COMMENTS
As with all TIP amendments, considerations with respect to public participation, financial capability, air quality, environmental justice and Plan consistency are important. Sufficient funding
is forecasted from federal and state sources for this amendment. The new projects listed meet all
amendment requirements mentioned above. Therefore this amendment does not cause any negative impact.
STAFF RECOMMENDATION
Attached to this memo is Resolution Number 2019-23. This Resolution approves the
amendment to the TIP FY 2018-2021. The Staff recommends approval.

 RESOLUTION NUMBER 2019-23
OF THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION POLICY COMMITTEE

revise the funding to one existing project.
WHEREAS, the Akron Metropolitan Area Transportation Study (AMATS) is designated as the
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) by the Governor, acting through the Ohio
Department of Transportation and in cooperation with locally elected officials in Summit and
Portage Counties and the Chippewa Township and Milton Township areas of Wayne County
and,
WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of this Committee to develop and maintain the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and,
WHEREAS, this Committee has been requested to amend the AMATS FY 2018-2021
Transportation Improvement Program to revise the funding to one existing project
1. SR 91 Sidewalks (PID 107814) – Is a TASA funded project in the City of Stow to
construct new sidewalks along SR 91 where none currently exist. The project begins 500
feet south of Conwill Road and ends 375 feet south of Fishcreek Road. The current
funding is $74,131 for right of way in FY 2020 and $516,050 for construction in FY
2021. Stow is requesting an additional $100,000 of TASA funding for right of way in FY
2020.
WHEREAS, the necessary public involvement has been carried out as described in the AMATS
Public Participation Plan and,
WHEREAS, the amendment has been judged to be air quality neutral and is, therefore, excluded
from additional regional air quality conformity analysis and,
WHEREAS, the environmental justice impacts of this amendment has been considered
consistent with “Executive Order 12898 Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low Income Populations” and,
WHEREAS, this Committee has analyzed this request and found this amendment to be
consistent with Transportation Outlook, the Regional Transportation Plan, and with the
availability of federal funds forecasted for the AMATS area.
