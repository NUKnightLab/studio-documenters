MARITIME COMMITTEE
Agenda Item 4 (C) (2) Maritime Update

 

Mr. David Gutheil acknowledged and thanked Logistec, MT and the International Longshoreman
Association for Sponsoring the Port?s 50-year anniversary stakeholder event. He then addressed
the Board and referred to a presentation attached hereto as ?Exhibit (slides Director
Holmes asked whether anything was being done to improve the aesthetics of the cruise terminal.
Mr. Gutheil replied that it has been mentioned to Mr. Dick Pace who is planning the waterfront
for the City of Cleveland. Mr. Friedman noted that there has definitely been a renaissance of lake
cruismg.

Referring to slide 6, Mr. Gutheil stated there?s been a slow start to the shipping season. Mr. Tosini
commented that FMT is forecasted for 400,000 tons of general cargo. Mr. Friedman noted that
domestic steel prices have significantly increased to around $200 per ton, compared to past costs
of $50 per ton. Mr. Gutheil noted it appears as though there will be no new tariffs being imposed
by the EU from a penalty standpoint. The Port of Cleveland deactivated its Foreign Trade Zone
(FTZ) status in 2008 when there was a change in inventory tax. The FTZ will now be reactivated
in order for companies to take advantage of deferral, which means the tariff cannot be changed,
but the company doesn?t have to pay duties until the cargo leaves the port.

Mr. Michel Tosini addressed the Board of Directors and presented the Port of Cleveland with a
inuksuik as a congratulations for the ports 50th Anniversary.

here being no public comment, Chairman McNai1 adjourned the meeting 9: 39 a. m.
