each category and each tax item, Totals – next to each category and a grand total; and
WHEREAS, these modifications will assist in improving government transparency and
understanding of said tax bill, empowering residents with the information necessary to

Consolidated property tax bill; additional information to be included
on property tax bill.

In addition to all information currently on the second installment of property tax
bills in Cook County, the tax bills shall also include a title “Consolidated Property Tax Bill.”
The tax bills shall also include a column titled “Percentage of Total Tax Bill.” The
“Percentage of Total Tax Bill” column will show, for each taxing district, the percentage of
the total tax bill that each taxing district makes up, using the current tax year dollar
amount. The column, “Taxing District”, shall be broken out into the following categories;
“County”, “Municipal”, “School Districts” and “Other”, and each taxing district shall be
listed within one of the four categories. Each category shall have a subtotal, both in dollar
amount and percentage, and there shall be a grand total under the four categories.
These modifications will be implemented provided that they fall within the current
constraints of the property tax bill, which allows a maximum of twenty-five lines.
Effective date: This Ordinance shall be effective upon adoption.
