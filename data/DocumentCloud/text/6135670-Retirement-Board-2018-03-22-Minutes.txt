In the matter of Ronald Holt, "Pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/5-214, and for all the reasons stated herein,
Holt has established entitlement to the police pension service credit sought for the period July 1st,
2010, the date Holt assumed the director of CAPS position with the CPD, to a date to be
determined, the date Holt ceases employment in the specified position, as the statutory provision
of the Act grants police pension service credit for such service; and the contribution required by
Holt to the Fund for the sought police pension service credit shall be calculated based upon the
amount Holt would have contributed with interest assuming Holt had remained an active member
of the CPD in the rank of police officer. Holt's request for police pension service credit for all or

14 - 15
Annuities to Widows [Summary pg. 16]
The Executive Director reviewed with the Board members the application for a Widow's Annuity
for a deceased retired officer, Albert Jordan. The Fund’s documentation indicates an inaccurate
date of birth was consistently used on documents of Retired Officer Jordan. The birth date used of
1928 differs from the actual birth date of 1932. This inaccurate date accelerated cost-of-living
adjustments paid to him. The summation of these cost-of-living increases paid based upon an
inaccurate date of birth sums to over $72,000.
The Board requested the Executive Director contact the widow to make an effort to recover the
overpayment, with a reasonable payment plan.
It was moved by Trustee Hauser, seconded by Trustee Wodnicki that the Board approve the
Annuities to Widows as detailed on pages 14 and 15.

•

The next item discussed concerned the option for retirees to authorize deductions from
their pensions for healthcare coverage provided by Aetna; Blue Cross/Blue Shield; and
United American Insurance, as previously discussed and approved by the Board. To
establish this deduction from a member’s annuity, Fund staff had sent written
communication to annuitants in which each annuitant was to provide written
authorization for the insurance premium deduction. The insurance companies have sent
files of enrolled members with the deductions charged, which have been paid to ensure
continuation of coverage for the annuitants. To date, however, there are slightly less than
200 members that have deductions coming out of their pension checks, but such members
have yet to provide written authorization. A drafted letter was distributed to the Board
members’ review. This letter will be sent to the members requesting completion of the
authorization. Ms. Tuczak noted this is a sensitive matter as the Fund does not wish to
stop the deductions and cause a lapse in health care coverage.

•

Ms. Tuczak next revisited the annuity overpayment to Chester Hornowski, which was
discussed at a previous meeting. Ms. Tuczak had spoken again with Mr. Hornowski’s
surviving spouse, who again offered to forfeit the death benefit of $6,000 in lieu of any
further recovery. However, if an additional money sum is to be requested of her, Ms.
Hornowski requested the death benefit be paid to her and she will agree to a $50 monthly
payment towards the indebtedness.

It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Summers that the Board accept the $6,000 death
benefit that the surviving spouse of Mr. Hornowski offered in lieu of the $15,000 overpayment.

While on the topic of annuity overpayments, Ms. Tuczak discussed the matter of
deceased widow, Ellen Collins. During the Fund’s signature affidavits request, Ellen
Collins had failed to return her affidavit. This resulted in a suspension of her widow’s
annuity late in 2016. During the Fund’s investigation it was revealed that Ellen Collins
passed away in 2014, resulting in an overpayment of widow’s annuity of approximately
$14,000. Attempts to recover the erroneously paid annuity have gone unresolved. After
much discussion it was agreed that Board counsel shall contact the family members of
Ellen Collins and work on a resolution, which may include reporting the matter to the
State’s Attorney or criminal charges.

•

The next item was an update concerning the Lieutenants’ grievance settlement regarding
pensionable salary increases effective July 1, 2016. After discussion on this matter, the Board
agreed that retroactive pension calculations would only be completed after finalization of the new
salary contract between the respective union and the City of Chicago. This procedure will ensure
that retroactive calculations are completed only once on each member impacted.

•

The next item for discussion was two legislative matters. There are two bills pending downstate;
one is a compound COLA after age of 75; and the other is removing the birth year restriction on
the 3.0% COLA. The Board requested impact statements on both legislative matters, but also
requested the Executive Director to negotiate price concessions with the Fund’s actuarial firm,
GRS. The Executive Director discussed the pricing obtained and expected timeline of the impact
statements.

•

While on the topic of actuarial issues there was discussion concerning the December 31, 2017,
valuation. For the December 31, 2016, valuation, the liability associated with the healthcare
subsidy was removed because at that time no subsidy was provided through the statutes.
However, an Appellate court decision has changed things. At issue, however, is that the
mechanics of this subsidy issued through the Appellate court have not been determined and are
still being negotiated with the various parties involved. In order to complete the actuarial
valuation in-time for year-end reporting requirements, a decision on inclusion of the liability must
be determined very soon. After discussion it was mutually agreed to not include the insurance
subsidy in the 2017 valuation, due to uncertainty of the exact members and dollars involved.

•

Ms. Tuczak next discussed a request from the Fraternal Order of Police’s (FOP) Disability
Committee, who wishes to perform a mailing to current members in receipt of disability benefits,
but does not have addresses on these members. The practice of the Fund is that member addresses
are not provided to outside parties, however, a blind mailer can be sent. The procedure is such
that the Fund provides addresses to a printer selected by the Fund, the FOP provides their printing
material to the printer, and the printer sends the materials, at the expense of the FOP. Once the
mailing is complete, the printer destroys this address list, never giving the addresses to the FOP.
The Board approved providing the addresses in this manner for the FOP requested mailing.

•

The last item concerns a disability recipient, Patricia J. Mackey. She was scheduled twice to be
examined by the Board’s physician, and failed to keep the appointments. She is scheduled for a
third time to see the Board’s physician. The policy has been if a member fails to keep medical
appointments, the disability benefit shall be suspended until the appointment is kept.
It was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Wodnicki that the Board suspend Patricia
Mackey’s disability benefit until she attends her scheduled medical appointment.
