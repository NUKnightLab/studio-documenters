GENERAL BACKGROUND
On March 13, 2009, the Grant Administration released a Request for Proposal (No. 09-00284) to support
its preparation and management of grant applications for funding from the United States government’s
economic stimulus effort known as the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (“ARRA”),
as well as related professional and administrative services required in conjunction with CHA requests,
such as management of and responses to technical, financial, regulatory and other elements of proposed
and actual requests or grant applications made by the CHA. CHA subsequently entered into Contract
Number 9029 to provide the necessary support for a base term of six (6) months, in an amount not- toexceed $97,800, with one (1) three-month option. Grant Administration is requesting ratification of the
exercise of the three-month option with Boulevard Group and the increase to the Contract’s funding by
an amount not-to-exceed $63,602.

 Boulevard Group provided support for CHA’s efforts to work directly with federal agencies to ensure
CHA had strong communication with the granting agency and had real time information on the status of
what was required to receive the ARRA funding. Boulevard Group also provided technical assistance in
the writing content of the ARRA grant applications, and the alignment of the grant application
requirements, especially as they related to HUD regulations.
During the option term, Boulevard Group provided technical assistance for writing the CHA FY09
HOPE VI Revitalization Grant – Madden Park Wells. CHA submitted an application for a $22 million
FY2009 HOPE VI Revitalization grant to fund the third phase of the Oakwood Shores mixed-income
development, which replaces the former Ida B. Wells public housing development. The award of the
HOPE VI grant would allow development funds currently planned for the Ida B. Wells revitalization to
be re-budgeted to other currently planned, but unfunded mixed-income revitalization projects.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to ratify the exercise of the three-month
option of the Contract’s term and the increase the Contract’s funding by an amount not-to-exceed
$63,602.00. The Contract’s new aggregate not-to-exceed funding amount will be 161,402.00.
