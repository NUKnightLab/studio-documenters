renovation of one hundred sixty-six (166) Family Housing units, including the associated site
work and landscaping, at Dearborn Homes (IL2–009). This is Phase 5 of the ongoing renovation
of this development and covers the buildings at 2840 S. State St., 2900 S. State St., 2901 S.
Federal St., and 2910 S. Dearborn St. The IFB was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the

The Pre-bid meeting and Site Visit were held on December 16, 2009. The CHA issued
Addendum No. 1 on December 29, 2009. It answered Requests for Information (RFI), covered
changes to existing drawings, and distributed both revised and new drawings.
The CHA received and opened eight (8) bids on January 11, 2010 at 10:00 am.
