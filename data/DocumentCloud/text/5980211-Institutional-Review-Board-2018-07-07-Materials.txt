 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Alteration to or
Waiver of Individual Authorization from the Illinois Criminal Justice Information
Authority Institutional Review Board
The Need for an Alteration to or Waiver of Individual Authorization
HIPAA privacy rules, among other things, set boundaries on the use and release of health records, establish
appropriate safeguards that health care providers and others must achieve to protect the privacy of health
information, and hold violators accountable for violating patients’ privacy rights. HIPAA also establishes
conditions under which Protected Health Information (PHI) may be used or disclosed by covered entities for
research purposes. In order to conduct research using medical records or other PHI, the researcher must present
an approved alteration to or waiver of the HIPAA individual authorization requirement to the covered entity
which possesses the PHI. The waiver must be approved by an IRB. 45 C.F.R. §164.512 (i)(1)(i)(A). The
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s IRB was established in accordance with 45 C.F.R. §46.107.

g) Is it practicable to conduct this research without using the PHI? ___ yes _X__ no
If you answered no, explain why it is not practicable.
PHI is needed to link patient records to other records/data to measure outcomes. The research study
including the protocol for the linking of records/data has been approved by an IRB.
h) Is this a retrospective chart review: __X_ yes ___no
If you answered no, can you get authorization from the research subjects? ___ yes _X__ no
If you answered no, explain why it is not practicable to get authorization for this research.
The Principal Investigator is unable to locate prior clients to allow them to consent to the research.
There are no records of patient location or methods to contact them after leaving treatment.
2. WAIVER CRITERIA.
(a) Is the risk to the individuals whose information you are using minimal? ___X_ yes ____ no
(i.e., the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not
greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests).

13

 (b) How will the identifiers be protected from improper use and disclosure? (e.g., they are kept in a
locked cabinet only available to the researchers, or they are maintained in a password-protected
database and only the researchers have access to the password. List all of the entities that might
have access to the study’s PHI such as UC, sponsors, FDA, data monitoring boards, any others
given authority by law).
The data will be maintained on password-protected computers and only the researchers have access
to the individual computers. Only researchers will have access to the files.
(c) What is the plan to destroy the identifiers at the earliest opportunity? If you do not plan to destroy the
PHI, please give your rationale.
(e.g., there is a plan to break any links to identifiable information, unless the links need to be
maintained, in which case a reason should be given).
Once the data are linked to other datasets following IRB-approved protocol, the data will be stripped
of identifiers (name). A unique individual code will be generated for each person that will replace
their names.
(d) Is the PI assuring that the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as
required by law, for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which to the
use or disclosure of PHI would be permitted? __X__ yes _____ no
Are there other written assurances? ____X__ yes ______ no
If yes, attach copies of the written assurances.
Memorandums of understanding will be signed by each substance abuse treatment provider and the
agency conducting research (Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority).
(e) List other factors that were considered to classify the use of PHI minimal risk.
Only administrative PHI data, rather than original data collection from human subjects, will be used
in accordance with federal guidelines under the Code of Federal Regulations and HIPPA, posing
minimal risk of harm to human subjects.
Investigator’s Certification/Assurance:
I certify that, to the best of my knowledge, the information provided in this request for Alteration to or Waiver
of Individual Authorization is complete and correct. I understand that I have the ultimate responsibility for

18. Identify the criteria for inclusion/exclusion of subjects and provide a clear rationale for them.
All known jail programs that offer one or both methods to assist detainees with opioid use disorders will be offered
the opportunity to participate in an interview as our interest is in learning more about those programs. We will
send to the jail administrator/sheriff and will interview the person designated to be the best person to answer
questions, which may be a representative of a treatment provider or local health department.
D. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
19. Briefly describe the potential benefits of the project to subjects and/or society. Note: Social science research
typically does not provide a direct benefit to the subjects.
This study will provide information on how these different evidence-based practices operate and offer insights for
other correctional systems seeking to implement similar efforts. This information is important because those
leaving correctional facilities have an increased risk of overdose after release. These proven methods, if expanded,
can further assist those suffering from opioid use disorders and prevent overdose death.

 Recruitment script
Interviews with Jail Administrators on Practices to Address Opioid Use Disorders and
Overdose

Jail Administrator/Sheriff,
ICJIA is conducting a research study on jail practices in Illinois to address opioid use disorders
and overdose. As you know, those leaving correctional facilities have an increased risk of
overdose after release. It is our understanding that your jail offers a naloxone distribution
program to detainees and/or medication assisted treatment for detainees with opioid use
disorders. We would like to interview you, or the best person who can answer questions, about
those practices.
Attached is a consent form that further explains about the study and interview. Also attached are
the questions that will be asked. We can conduct the interview by phone. Please contact me to
choose a time that works best for you.
Thank you in advance for helping with this study which will provide information and offer
insights for other correctional systems seeking to implement similar efforts. These proven
methods, if expanded, can further assist those suffering from opioid use disorders and prevent
overdose death.
Sincerely,
Jessica Reichert

Changes

No changes

1.) Please explain in detail what changes you plan to make to the study design or protocol (such
as changes to instruments used, data collection, recruitment procedures, or compensation).
Researchers intend to expand their recruitment efforts to include posting the study flyer in spaces
open to the public (e.g., libraries, community centers, etc.), and dissemination of recruitment
materials to local and state organizations or agencies that primarily serve youth in care, or wards
of the state, and probationers or parolees who are over the age of 18.
Changes have been made to the adult and family member interview protocols to include
language that will verbally inform each interview participant that disclosure of their intent to
harm self or others, or current harm to a vulnerable person, such as a child, or elderly or disabled
person will be reported to the appropriate entities (e.g., law enforcement, child welfare, etc.). The
following language will be added to both the adult and family member interview protocols.
“If you say you are going to harm yourself, I may have to report. If you say you
are going to harm someone else, I may have to make a report. If you share about
any current harm to someone who is a child, elderly, or disabled, I may have to
report. We are doing this out of concern for you and others. If I make a report, I
may share your name, contact information, and a description of harm to the
appropriate agency.”
The protocol for making a report when a participant discloses their intention to harm themselves
or others, or current harm of a vulnerable person, such as a child, or elderly or disabled person is
below:
Procedures to Report Harm or Abuse during Research Interviews
The following will be included in the confidentiality section of the informed consent form
and stated at the start of the interview:
If you say you are going to harm yourself, I may have to report. If you say you are going to harm
someone else, I may have to make a report. If you share about any current harm to someone who
is a child, elderly, or disabled, I may have to report. We are doing this out of concern for you and
others. If I make a report, I may share your name, contact information, and a description of harm
to the appropriate agency.
What would be reported?
1. Name, age, address, contact information of participant;
2. If available and appropriate, the name and address of the alleged abuser or target of harm;
3. An explanation of why it is believed there is a plan to harm, or abuse has occurred.
Plan to harm themselves:
1. At the end of the interview the researcher will express concern for the participant and

35

first try to connect them to a resource provider.
“You mentioned that you plan to hurt yourself and I am concerned about you. Can we
look over the resource list or identify the hotline that may be able to help you?”
National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-8255
If participant does not want to reach out to supports or has an explicit plan, the researcher
will note they need to break confidentiality.
“To ensure your safety and as I noted at the start of the interview, I will need to report
your plan to harm yourself.”
The researcher will make a report to the appropriate entity, which might include:
a. National Suicide Prevention Hotline
b. The local law enforcement entity or 911
The researcher will alert their supervisor and research director at the Illinois Criminal
Justice Information Authority (ICJIA).
a. These reports will be overseen by the supervisor and research director. Any
reports made will be debriefed and changes to protocol may be created, including
halting of interviews until potential harm or distress within the research protocol
is addressed.
All reports will be summarized in an email sent to the IRB liaison at ICJIA and the IRB
chair.

Plan to harm others:
1. At the end of the interview the researcher will state the following: “I heard about your
plan to harm [person], this concerns me. As I noted at the start of the interview, I may
need to report your plan to harm this person.”
2. If the participant does not deny or otherwise communicate they do not intend to harm
[person], the researcher will proceed with making a report.
3. The researcher will alert their supervisor and research director at ICJIA.
4. The researcher will make a report to the appropriate entity, most likely:
a. The local law enforcement entity
5. All reports will be summarized in an email sent to the IRB liaison at ICJIA and the IRB
chair.
Learn about current harm of a vulnerable person, such as a child, or elderly, or disabled
persons
1. At the end of the interview the researcher will state the following: “I heard about
[description of circumstances], this concerns me. As I noted at the start of the interview, I
may need to report this harm to [person] to the appropriate agency.”
2. The researcher will inform their supervisor about the potential of reporting following the
interview.
3. The supervisor and the researcher will discuss the context of the disclosure and if
possible, listen to the audio together. They are to make a determination about reporting
within 48 hours of the interview.
4. If the supervisor and researcher decide a report is warranted, the researcher will alert the
research director at ICJIA.
5. The researcher will make a report to the appropriate entity, which might include:
a. Department of Child and Family Services Hotline

36

 b. Adult Protective Services
c. The local law enforcement entity
6. All reports will be summarized in an email sent to the IRB liaison at ICJIA and the IRB
chair.

2.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the amendment? Is the amendment the result of an adverse/negative
event?
Expanding recruitment to include places open to the public increases the likelihood that
individuals who have not sought services following victimization are included in the study. This
strategy will help to ensure that interview participants are more representative of young adults
and parents/caregivers of young children who have experienced victimization, as barriers often
inhibit victims from seeking and/or receiving services. Researchers seek to explicitly include
youth in care, or wards of the state, and probationers or parolees who are 18 years of age or older
in this study. To reach these populations researchers will need to contact local or state
organizations or agencies serving youth in care or probationers or parolees who are 18 years of
age or older. Researchers will obtain permission from agency directors and/or agency IRBs
serving youth in care, or wards of the state, and probationers or parolees and submit these
permissions/approvals to ICJIA’s IRB prior to beginning recruitment with vulnerable
populations.
Given the topics that will be discussed during the interview (e.g., victimization experiences,
system experiences, etc.) it is possible that information regarding intended harm to self or others,
or harm to a vulnerable person, such as a child, or elderly or disabled person may be shared.
Researchers will to report this information to the appropriate entities (e.g., law enforcement,
child welfare) when it is learned through the course of their study per the protocol developed.
Researchers are not trained to intervene with individuals at a heightened risk of harming
themselves or others, or to intervene in situations in which children, or elderly or disabled
persons may be at increased risk of abuse or neglect. Therefore, researchers should contact the
appropriate entities to intervene on behalf of those at risk of harm.

3.) Does this amendment alter, in any way, the assessment of potential risks described in your
approved protocol?
Yes

X

No

 4.) If you answered yes to question 3, please explain in detail how this alters the assessment of
potential risk and whether the benefits of the study outweigh the risks.

Changes

No changes

7.) What types of changes are being made to the consent documents/forms?
X

Adding or removing information from the consent form so that it is consistent with an

(e.g., spelling changes, revising a statement)
Removal of questionnaires or instruments that required consent forms
Other (please specify):

8.) Please explain in detail how you will alter the consent documents.
The interview consent forms will be amended to include additional information regarding
reporting procedures discussed in Section III. The information provided will inform interview
participants of the researcher’s responsibility to report disclosures of intended harm to self, and
others, and current harm to vulnerable persons, such as children, or elderly or disabled person.
The following language will be added to the consent form.
“Out of a concern for the safety of yourself and others, if during the interview,
you say you are going to harm yourself or someone else, the researcher may have
to make a report. If you share about any current harm to someone who is a child,
elderly, or disabled the researcher may have to make a report. If the researcher
needs to make a report they may share your name, contact information, and a
description of the harm to the appropriate agency.”

9.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the change? Is this change the result of an adverse/negative event?
Given the topics that will be discussed during the interview (e.g., victimization experiences,
system experiences, etc.) it is possible that information regarding intended harm to self or others,
or harm to a vulnerable person, such as a child, or elderly or disabled person may be shared.
Researchers have a moral and ethical obligation to report this information to the appropriate
entities (e.g., law enforcement, child welfare) when it is learned through the course of their
study.
It is important that interview participants are informed of the researcher’s responsibility to report

39

 disclosures of intended harm to self or others, or current harm to vulnerable persons, such as
children, or elderly or disabled person prior to participating in an interview so that participants
can make an informed decision about whether to disclose information that may trigger the
researcher’s responsibility to report to the appropriate entities. This information will first be
presented in writing through the consent form. Participants will be given an opportunity to ask
questions about the study procedures outlined in the consent form before agreeing to participate
in the research, including the researcher’s responsibility to report. Participants will also be
verbally told about the interviewer’s responsibility to report disclosures of intended harm to self
and others, or current harm to vulnerable persons, such as children, or elderly or disabled person
before the interview begins.

10.) Please submit the original and altered consent documents and highlight the changes. If filing
the amendment electronically, are these documents appended to this form or contained in a
separate document?

No changes

11.) What types of changes are being made to the project sites or study participants?
X

Changing who is included in the study sample

X

Inclusion of new or additional special populations as subjects
Changing sites or programs
Changing the number of subjects
Other (please specify):

12.) Please provide a detailed explanation of how you will change who will be included in your
study sample, if applicable.
Researchers would like to expand their inclusionary criteria for parents and caregivers of
children under 12 years old to parents and caregivers of children under 18 years old. As result,
parents and caregivers of children under 18 years old will be eligible to participate in the online
survey portion of the study, and select parents and caregivers of children under 18 years old
whose children who have experienced victimization will be invited for an interview.
In addition, researchers propose the inclusion of youth in care, or wards of the state, and
probationers or parolees who are 18 years or older. Researchers would explicitly recruit these
populations by contacting agencies whose primary focus is serving youth in care or those under
court supervision, i.e., probationers or parolees.

40

 13.) Please provide the rationale for making these changes.
Expanding inclusionary criteria to parents or caregivers of older children (i.e., 12-17 years old)
will enable researchers to learn more about youth’s experiences with harm. In the present study,
parents and caregivers of youth would offer a unique and invaluable perspective on the impact
that victimization has had on their adolescent children, and how both parents/caregivers and their
adolescent children navigated systems of care following victimization.
Young adults with involvement in the child welfare and/or juvenile justice systems have high
rates of victimization and have had contact with one or more service provider groups. Thus, a
study that seeks to understand the victimization experiences of young adults and their contact
with providers following victimization must include these populations to truly inform the field’s
understanding of how to improve services and supports for these populations. Failing to include
these populations would lead to a gap in our understanding of young adults’ experiences in
navigating different systems of care following victimization.

14.) Will your study now include new or additional special populations? If yes, please indicate
which ones:
Minors under age 18
Adult prisoners or individuals in secure confinement
Juveniles in correctional or detention facilities
X

Probationers, parolees, or individuals under court or correctional supervision

 VII. CONFIDENTIALITY, PRIVACY, OR SECURITY

X Changes

No changes

21.) What changes are being made that may affect the confidentiality or privacy of the subjects,
or security of the subjects or data?
Language has been added to the beginning of the interview protocols, and to the informed
consent sheets that informs participants of the researcher’s responsibility to report disclosures of
intended harm to self or others, or current harm to a vulnerable person, such as a child, or elderly
or disabled person. Under these conditions researchers would contact the appropriate authorities
(e.g., law enforcement, child welfare, etc.) to ensure the safety of the participant and/or others at
risk of harm. The researcher would report the information necessary (e.g., name, contact
information, description of harm/abuse) for the appropriate authority to intervene on behalf of
the person at risk of harm.

22.) Please provide the rationale for making these changes.
Researchers have an obligation to report information about a participant’s intention to harm
themselves or others, or the current abuse of vulnerable persons, such as children, elderly or
disabled person to the appropriate entities (e.g., law enforcement, child welfare) when it is
learned through the course of their study. Researchers are not trained to intervene with
individuals at a heightened risk of harming themselves or others, or in situations in which
children, or elderly or disabled persons may be at increased risk of abuse or neglect. Therefore,
researchers should contact the appropriate entities to intervene on behalf of those at risk of harm.

23.) Please indicate what steps will be taken to ensure the privacy, confidentiality, and security
of the study subjects or data.
Procedures for ensuring the privacy, confidentiality, and security of participants and their data
that do make a disclosure triggering the researcher’s responsibility to report intended harm to self
or others, or abuse of vulnerable persons, such as children, or elderly or disabled persons will
remain unchanged.
All participants will be informed in both the informed consent sheet and in a statement made
before the interview begins that disclosures of harm to self or others, or the abuse of vulnerable
persons, such as children, or elderly or disabled persons may trigger a researcher’s responsibility
to share certain information with the appropriate entities (e.g., law enforcement, child welfare,
etc.) to ensure the safety of the participants or others at risk of harm. Participants will be able
make an informed decision about whether to disclose information that would lead to a report
being made by the researcher.

45

 XI. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
30.) Discuss how these proposed changes may affect the risks posed to human subjects.
The study’s overall risk has not changed because the procedures involved are the same as the
original IRB application, but we are proposing to expand recruitment to include a more
vulnerable population, i.e., youth in care, or wards of the state, and probationers or parolees.
Expanding the inclusionary criteria to include youth in care, or wards of the state, and
probationers and parolees over 18 years old could increase risk to those participants. They
represent a highly victimized population that has likely had considerable contact with systems
following their experiences with victimization. However, involvement in this research study is
voluntary and participants may discontinue their participation at any time without penalty. And
in sharing their stories to help others they may feel a sense of empowerment that outweighs or
mitigates risks of participating.
31.) Discuss how these proposed changes may affect the potential benefits of the project to
subjects and or society.
Expanding the research study to include parents and caregivers of children under 18 years old
and youth in care, or wards of the state, and probationers or parolees who are 18 years or older
will likely increase the study’s benefit to society. Incorporating these additional perspectives will
increase the field’s understanding of victimization, and contact with providers following
victimization informing our understanding of how to improve services and supports for young
victims.
The changes may also increase the safety of research participants and others at risk of harm.
Researchers will report the information necessary (e.g., name, contact information, description of
harm/abuse) for the appropriate authority to intervene on behalf of participants and others who
may be at risk of harm. Interventions following these reports may facilitate participant access to
supports and services to help them and others at risk of harm.

Project

Why am I being asked?
You are being asked to be a subject in a research study to help the state of Illinois better
understand the nature of child and youth victimization, and the needs of children, youth, and
their families and their experiences with systems of care following victimization. You have been
asked to participate in this study because you are a young adult (i.e., aged 18-25) who has
experienced victimization as a child or youth (i.e., under 21 years old) or you are the parent or
primary caregiver of a child (i.e., under 18 years old) who has experienced victimization.
Your participation in this research is voluntary. Your decision whether to participate will not
affect your current or future dealings with the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
(ICJIA). If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without affecting
that relationship.
Approximately 100 subjects may be involved in this research at ICJIA.

49

 What is the purpose of this research?
The purpose of this research is to better understand the nature of child and youth victimization,
and the needs of children, youth, and their families and their experiences with systems of care
following victimization. Specifically, researchers are seeking to increase the state’s knowledge
of how systems of care are connected and whether they adequately meet the needs of child and
youth victims, and their families.
What procedures are involved?
If you agree to participate, you will have the option to participate in the interview in person or
via phone. We estimate that the interview will take approximately 60-90 minutes. The in-person
interview will be audio-recorded with your permission. You can choose not to be audiorecorded. If you choose not to be audio-recorded, we will simply document your responses using
paper and pencil. You will be asked questions about different experiences from your childhood
or your child’s experiences. Specifically, we will ask you about your or your child(ren)’s
victimization experiences, your/your child(ren)’s needs and family members’ needs following
victimization, the kinds of resources you or your child(ren) may or may not have received, and
the agencies and organizations that you or your child(ren) had contact with.
What are the potential risks and discomforts?
Some questions may make you uncomfortable or may cause you some emotional or
psychological distress. Please remember, it is up to you to decide whether to answer any of the
questions. You will be provided with a community resource list of adult victim service providers
you may contact if you experience discomfort or distress, and a separate list of child victim
service providers.
There may be other risks from the study that are not known at this time.
Will I be told about new information that may affect my decision to participate?
During the course of the study, you will be informed of any significant new research information
(either good or bad), such as changes in the risks or benefits resulting from participation in the
research or new alternatives to participation, that might cause you to change your mind about
continuing in the research. If new information is provided to you, your consent to continue
participating in this research may be re-obtained.
Are there benefits to taking part in the research?
You will be offered a $75 gift card for being in this study. You will receive no other direct
benefit from participation in the research.
Indirect benefits include a better understanding of child and youth victimization, the needs of
children, youth, and their families and their experiences with systems of care following
victimization.

50

 What other options are there?
You have the option to not participate in this study. Even if you initially choose to participate
you may change your decision at any time without penalty. You may also not answer a
question at any time. This will not affect the compensation you receive for participating in the
study.
You will be asked to be audio-recorded. You may choose to participate in an interview but not be
audio-recorded. If you choose not to be audio-recorded, the information will be collected using
pencil and paper.
What about privacy and confidentiality?
The people who will know that you are a research subject are members of the research team.
If you agree, interviews will be audio-recorded and saved on secure computers and/or servers in
the Authority offices. Audio-recordings on the recording devices will be erased within 48 hours
of recording. Interview transcriptions in computerized word processing files will be stored
securely on the Authority’s computers and servers. Any information that might identify you will
be removed from the interview transcripts. Only the researchers will have access to the audiorecording, transcripts, and notes.
You may choose to participate in the study even if you do not want to be audio-recorded. In this
case, we will simply take notes using pencil and paper. These notes will be later typed and stored
securely on the Authority’s computers and servers. These notes will not contain any information
that might identify you.
The information collected in the study may be used to write a research report. No potentially
identifying information that can be attributed directly to you will be included in the report or
discussed with others.
Out of a concern for the safety of yourself and others, if during the interview, you say you are
going to harm yourself or someone else, the researcher may have to make a report. If you share
about any current harm to someone who is a child, elderly, or disabled the researcher may have
to make a report. If the researcher needs to make a report they may share your name, contact
information, and a description of the harm to the appropriate agency.
What are the costs for participating in this research?
There are no costs to you for participating in this research.
Will I be reimbursed for any of my expenses or paid for my participation in this research?
You will be offered a $75 gift card for being in this study.

51

 Can I withdraw or be removed from the study?
If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue participation
at any time. This will not affect the compensation you receive for participating in the study.
Who should I contact if I have questions?

Adults with Child Victimization Histories Interview Protocol
Study of Victim Needs of Children, Youth, & Families
[Turn on recording device if agreed to audio record]
If you say you are going to harm yourself, I may have to report. If you say you are going to harm
someone else, I may have to make a report. If you share about any current harm to someone who
is a child, elderly, or disabled, I may have to report. We are doing this out of concern for you
and others. If I make a report, I may share your name, contact information, and a description of
harm to the appropriate agency.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
First, I would like to get to know you a bit better before we talk about specific experiences you
may have had. I will use this chart to help keep track of this information.
[Interviewer will present chart and record information in chart throughout interview.]
1. Thinking about right now, can you describe or tell me about:
• Where you live?
• Who you live with (e.g., parents/caregivers, children, siblings, other family members,
peers)?
• Significant others or dating partners you have?
• How you spend your time, whether at work, home, or school?
• Anything else you would like me to know about you before we move on to what life
was like for you as a child or youth?
Now I’d like to learn more about you as a child or youth.
2. Can you describe or tell me about:
• When and where you were born?
• Where you lived, including the city or town?
o How would you describe where you lived: mostly urban, suburban, or rural?
• Who you lived with (e.g., parents/caregivers, children, siblings, other family
members, peers) growing up?
• Parents, other caregivers, children, or siblings you did not live with growing up?
• Significant others or dating partners you may have had?
• The schools you’ve gone to or the places you worked when you were a youth?
3. Can you tell me about any major changes, whether positive or negative, you experienced
growing up?
I can read you some examples of major changes. Would that be helpful?

57

 [If YES]
Some changes might be:
• Having a new sibling or child
• Moving to a new home
• Going to a new school or getting a new job
• Being seriously hurt or sick
• Having problems at school or work
• Parents or caregivers getting separated/divorced/remarried
• Losing a close friend or family member
Follow-up questions:
• When did this change(s) happen?
• What was that change like for you?
VICTIMIZATION EXPERIENCES
Next, I’m interested in different experiences you had as a child or youth. We asked about some
of these experiences in the online survey you took. You may remember that this survey asked
questions about experiences you had where you or someone else was harmed. I would like to
talk to you more about those experiences.
4. Can you tell me about a time when a person harmed you?
Follow-up questions:
• How old were you when this first happened?
• Where did this experience happen?
• Who harmed you?
• How did this person(s) harm you?
• Did this person(s) harm you in another way, or at a different time?
• Did you have an experience like this again with the same person(s) or a different
person(s)?
5. Were there any other times when a person harmed you? Can you tell me more about
those experience(s)?
Follow-up questions:
• How old were you when this first happened?
• Where did this experience happen?
• Who harmed you?
• How did this person(s) harm you?
• Did this person(s) harm you in another way, or at a different time?
• Did you have an experience like this again with the same person(s) or a different
person(s)?

58

 6. Can you tell me about a time when you saw or heard a person harming someone else?
Follow-up questions:
• How old were you?
• Where were you when you saw or heard this happen?
• Who was harmed and who was causing the harm?
• Did you see or hear this person harmed this person being harmed in another way,
or a different time?
• Did you see or hear this person being harmed in the same way by the same
person(s) or a different person(s)?

NEEDS
Following experiences like the one you described, individuals may need help. You might need
help right away, such as when someone needs medical care for injuries, or later on, such as
support when attending court. Here is a list of needs or help some people have after being
harmed.
[Interviewer will offer the Needs List].
Please use the Needs List to think about the help you may have needed and to circle or check off
each need.
7. Thinking of the experience(s) you just described, can you tell me about the help you
needed?
Follow-up questions for each NEED CATEGORY (e.g., health, housing, etc.):
• Can you tell me more about needing [Insert NEED CATEGORY]?
• When did you first need this help?

 Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Family Member/Caregiver Interview Protocol
Study of Victim Needs of Children, Youth, & Families
[Turn on recording device if agreed to audio record]
If you say you are going to harm yourself, I may have to report. If you say you are going to harm
someone else, I may have to make a report. If you share about any current harm to someone who
is a child, elderly, or disabled, I may have to report. We are doing this out of concern for you
and others. If I make a report, I may share your name, contact information, and a description of
harm to the appropriate agency.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
First, I would like to get to know you a bit better before we talk about specific experiences your
child(ren) may have had. I will use this chart to help keep track of this information.
[Interviewer will present chart and record information in chart throughout interview.]
1. Thinking about right now, can you describe or tell me about:
• Where you live?
• Who you live with (e.g., parents/caregivers, children, siblings, other family members,
peers)?
• Significant others or dating partners you have?
• How you spend your time, whether at work, home, or school?
• Anything else you would like me to know about you before we move on to what life
was like for you as a child or youth?
Now I’d like to learn more about your child(ren) currently under 18 years old.
2. Can you describe or tell me about:
• When and where they were born?
• The school they go to and any other schools they’ve gone to before?

o Where they live, including the city or town? How would you describe the area
they live in: mostly urban, suburban, or rural?
o Who they live with (e.g., parents/caregivers, children, siblings, other family
members, peers)?
• Parents, other caregivers, or siblings they do not live with?
3. Can you tell me about any major changes, whether positive or negative, your child(ren)
have experienced?
I can read you some examples of major changes. Would that be helpful?
[If YES]

• Moving to a new home
• Going to a new school or getting a new job
• Being seriously hurt or sick
• Having problems at school or work
• Parents or caregivers getting separated/divorced/remarried
• Losing a close friend or family member
Follow-up questions:
• When did this change(s) happen?
• What was that change like for your child(ren)?
VICTIMIZATION EXPERIENCES
Next, I’m interested in different experiences your child(ren) currently under 18 years of age have
had. We asked about some of these experiences in the online survey you took. You may
remember that this survey asked questions about experiences your child(ren) had where they
were harmed or they saw or heard someone else being harmed. I would like to talk to you more
about those experiences.
4. Can you tell me about a time when a person harmed your child(ren)?
Follow-up questions:
• How old were they when this first happened?
• Where did this experience happen?
• Who harmed them?
• How did this person(s) harm them?
• Did this person(s) harm them in another way, or at a different time?
• Did they have an experience like this again with the same person(s) or a different
person(s)?

about those experience(s)?
Follow-up questions:
• How old were they when this first happened?
• Where did this experience happen?
• Who harmed them?
• How did this person(s) harm them?
• Did this person(s) harm them in another way, or at a different time?
• Did they have an experience like this again with the same person(s) or a different
person(s)?

63

 6. Can you tell me about a time when your child(ren) saw or heard a person harming
someone else?
Follow-up questions:
• How old were they?
• Where were they when they saw or heard this happen?
• Who was harmed and who was causing the harm?
• Did your child(ren) see or hear this person harmed this person being harmed in
another way, or a different time?
• Did your child(ren) see or hear this person being harmed in the same way by the
same person(s), or a different person(s)?

NEEDS
Following experiences like the one you described, individuals may need help. You might need
help right away, such as when someone needs medical care for injuries, or later on, such as
support when attending court. Here is a list of needs or help some people have after being
harmed.
[Interviewer will offer the Needs List].
Please use the Needs List to think about the help you or your child(ren) may have needed and to
circle or check off each need.
7. Thinking of the experience(s) you just described, can you tell me about the help you and
your child(ren) needed?
Follow-up questions for each NEED CATEGORY (e.g., health, housing, etc.):
• Can you tell me more about you/your child(ren) needing [Insert NEED
CATEGORY]?
• Was that a need that you had, your child(ren) had, or both?

1.) Please explain in detail what changes you plan to make to the study design or
protocol (such as changes to instruments used, data collection, recruitment
procedures, or compensation)
Researchers are conducting an evaluation of the PERC program. PERC offers entrepreneur
training and coaching to formerly incarcerated/returning citizens and the opportunity to
receive a business loan to start their own business. The initial IRB application was approved
for researchers to administer an informed consent form to participate in the study. Only those
who consented to participation in the research study will be in the program.
Two new components of the study will be added at this time to further understand and
evaluate the program. They are detailed below and related forms are attached to this
application.
Component 1: Client survey about mentorship (n=16)
a.)

Time involvement of subjects: 10 minutes

b.)

Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if
applicable: The survey will be conducted online (if necessary, paper copies will be

80

 available through mail and contacts at the training agency).
Recruitment will be completed in the following way:
PERC training agency staff will forward a link on to clients who have mentors via email
informing them about the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback about how mentorship is
going so far.
Note: Client survey about mentorship and recruitment wording attached.
c.)

Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they
withdraw voluntarily): None

d.)

What subjects will experience or do: Subjects who consent will be asked questions about
the mentoring they experienced as part of the PERC program. Specifically, the survey will
cover the amount of communication with their mentor, the nature of the communication,
and ratings about the mentor and mentorship process overall.

Note: There are no individuals’ names collected on this survey.
Component 2: Training agency mentorship survey (n=5)
a.)

Time involvement of subjects: 10 to 12 minutes

b.)
Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if
applicable: The survey will be conducted online.
Recruitment will be completed in the following way:
ICJIA researcher will email a link to training agency staff about the opportunity to provide
feedback about the mentorship component of their agency’s entrepreneurship training program
for PERC.
Note: Training agency mentorship survey and recruitment wording attached.
c.)
Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they
withdraw voluntarily): none
d.)
What subjects will experience or do: Subjects who consent will be asked questions about
the development of PERC mentoring and the selection of mentors as well as their ratings of the
mentorship program overall.
Note: There are no individuals’ names collected on this survey.

2.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the amendment? Is the amendment the result of an
adverse/negative event?

81

 This amendment is proposed to add study components of the evaluation to further understand and
evaluate the PERC program. There have been no adverse or negative events with the research
study to date. The rationale for the surveys is to better understand the mentoring component of the
PERC program from both the mentee and training agency perspective, as there appears to be
variation during implementation. The data may indicate potential areas for staff training and other
areas for program improvement.

3.) Does this amendment alter, in any way, the assessment of potential risks described in your
approved protocol?
Yes

X

No

4.) If you answered yes to question 3, please explain in detail how this alters the assessment of potential
risk and whether the benefits of the study outweigh the risks.

IV. CONSENT PROCEDURES

X

Changes

No changes

5.) If you are changing your consent procedures, please explain these alterations in detail.
Both surveys will include an electronic consent that respondents must agree to before participating;
they are described below.
Component 1: Client survey about mentorship
a.) Who will obtain consent? ICJIA researchers.
b.) How will consent be obtained? Research staff provide the clients with the consent verbiage
online, to which respondents agree by clicking a button saying “I agree to participate”. Each of
the subjects will have already signed a consent form to be in the overall study when they
completed the initial application and met eligibility requirements. This will be an additional
consent form for the client mentor survey.
c.) How often will consent be obtained (e.g., longitudinal or long-term field studies)?
Once
d.) How will you verify the subject fully understands the consent? The consent form is written in a
9th grade or lower reading level. The consent form will provide contact information for the
principal investigator, the Authority’s attorney/IRB secretary to request further information
about the study, their rights as a research participant, and PERC.
e.) How will your investigators be trained to use the informed consent process?
Trained research staff are in charge of the informed consent process, which will be presented

82

 for subjects to read electronically before they affirm their agreement to participate in the
online survey.

Component 2: Training agency mentorship survey
a.) Who will obtain consent? ICJIA researchers.
b.) How will consent be obtained? Research staff provide the training agency staff with the
consent verbiage online, to which respondents agree by clicking a button saying “I agree to
participate”.
c.) How often will consent be obtained (e.g., longitudinal or long-term field studies)?
Once
d.) How will you verify the subject fully understands the consent? The consent form is written in a
9th grade or lower reading level. The consent form will provide contact information for the
principal investigator, the Authority’s attorney/IRB secretary to request further information
about the study, their rights as a research participant, and PERC.
e.) How will your investigators be trained to use the informed consent process?
Trained research staff will be in charge of informed consent process.

6.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the change? Is this change the result of an adverse/negative event?
The rationale is to have all components of the study involve human subject consent. This is not due
to an adverse/negative event.

V. CONSENT DOCUMENTS

Changes

X

No changes

Note: researchers are adding forms not changing exiting forms.

already approved IRB statement (e.g., the cost section, or phone number change)
Revising the consent form to reflect what was already approved in the protocol
Defining a phrase(s) more clearly in lay language
Incorporating in the consent form updated IRB-mandated language

Consent for Participation in Research
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Researchers are required to provide a
consent form such as this one to tell you about the research, to explain that taking part is
voluntary, to describe the risks and benefits of participation, and to help you to make an
informed decision. You should feel free to ask the researchers any questions you may have.
Principal Investigator: Jessica Reichert, Manager, Center for Justice Research and Evaluation
Agency and Funding: Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, 300 W. Adams St., Suite
200, Chicago, IL 60606 or (312) 793-8550. This project was funded by the federal Justice
Assistance Grant Program.
Why am I being asked?
We would like to compare outcomes of clients based on different treatment referral methods.
Outcome data include referral source, demographics (DOB, gender, race), mental and physical
health information (including diagnoses, medications, etc.), substance use and treatment history,
and current treatment.
In addition, you may be asked to consent to completing a survey at various points in your
treatment (or a pre- and post-test) for this study. This data will be used in addition to outcome
data in this study.
How will the information be used?
We will use this information to determine whether people who access treatment by different
means (Safe Passage/police referral, court ordered, or other referral) have different outcomes
(e.g., days in treatment, completion of treatment level of care, arrests).
Will anyone know that I am taking part in this study?
The investigators of this research project and their staff members will have access to this
information.
What are the potential risks and discomforts?
To the best of our knowledge, completing the interview will have no more risk of harm than you
would experience in everyday life.
Participating in the research (or not) will not affect your ability to receive help through Safe
Passage.
Your participation (or not) will not affect your relationship with law enforcement (police
department or sheriff), the treatment provider, or Safe Passage.
What about privacy and confidentiality?
The people who will know that you are a research subject are members of the research team.
Otherwise information about you will only be disclosed to others with your written permission.

124

 A possible risk of the research is that your participation in the research or information about you
might become known to individuals outside the research.
Authority staff will use your treatment record information for research only.
A report will include a summary of information received from this and other sources. The
Authority will publish the results from the study on their website. Authority staff may also share
the results at meetings or other public forums. When the results of the research are published or
discussed in conferences, no information will be included that would reveal your identity.
What are the costs for participating in this research?
There are no costs to you for participating in this research.
Will I be reimbursed for any of my expenses or paid for completing the survey?
You will not be offered payment for being in this study.
How long is this authorization valid?
Information may be obtained from your treatment records and other state records and used by
this research team which expires at the end of the study. State records include criminal justice
records, employment records, and public health records.
May I withdraw, at a future date, my consent to participate in this study or share my treatment
record information with researchers?
You have the right, at any time, to withdraw from participating in this study. Deciding not to
participate or withdrawing from the study will not affect your current or future treatment care or
relationship with Safe Passage (if applicable).
Who should I contact if I have questions?
Contact the researchers Jessica Reichert, Senior Research Analyst, at (312) 793-8550 or
Jessica.Reichert@Illinois.gov if you have any questions about this study or your part in it, or, if
you have questions, concerns or complaints about the research.
What are my rights as a research subject?
If you feel you have not been treated according to the descriptions in this form, or if you have
any questions about your rights as a research subject, including questions, concerns, complaints,
or to offer input, you may contact the IRB secretary, Simeon Kim, Associate General Counsel, at
(312) 793-8550 or Simeon.Kim@Illinois.gov.
