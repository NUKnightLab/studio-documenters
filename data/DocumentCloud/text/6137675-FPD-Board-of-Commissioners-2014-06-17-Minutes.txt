EASEMENT REQUEST
Department: Planning and Development

 FPD Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 17, 2014

Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”) to grant a
temporary easement to the Illinois Department of Transportation (“IDOT”) at Harts Road and the North Branch of
the Chicago River for 0.02 acre or 741 square feet.
Reason: IDOT requests a temporary construction easement to access the North Branch of the Chicago River along
the north side of Harts Road for a slope stabilization project. The slope stabilization is necessary to ensure the
continued operation and safety of the Harts Road Bridge over the river. This remediation will stabilize the river
bank and prevent further loss of soil, trees, and vegetation. The slope stabilization will decrease the sediment load
in the river, thus reducing surface water degradation and stream siltation.
Slope stabilization utilizing a 12-inch tall stone slope mattress over 36-inch tall gabions is to be placed along the
banks of the North Branch Chicago River. A synthetic geofilter fabric will be placed on the ground below the
slope mattress and gabions.
The area for the temporary easement is 0.02 acres. IDOT indicates that 4 (four) trees are expected to be removed
for this project.
Easement Fee: $1,500.00
Tree Mitigation Fee: $1,814.12

PROPOSED AGREEMENT

 FPD Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 17, 2014

Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”) to enter into
an agreement with Wisconsin Central Limited (“WC”), a subsidiary of Canadian National Railway, to construct and
maintain a bicycle-pedestrian pass under WC tracks in Chicago Heights, Illinois.
Reason: The Forest Preserve plans to connect three separate portions of the existing Thorn Creek Trail System
and link the Thorn Creek Trail with the Old Plank Road Trail and the Burnham Greenway Trail. The project will
add 4.75 miles of new trail to the existing system of 12.7 miles. This trail project was initially approved at the
1/10/2007 meeting of the Forest Preserve District Board of Commissioners. Authorization to pay 20% of the cost
of construction was approved on 11/12/2013.
To provide safe crossings and create a contiguous trail system, construction of trail improvements is required under
an existing span beneath the railroad’s existing bridge where the railroad crosses the Thorn Creek tributary at
railroad milepost 24.25. The underpass has been designed to IDOT standards and has been approved for
construction.
The Forest Preserve has filed a petition before the Illinois Commerce Commission (the “Commission”) requesting
permission to build the proposed underpass and it is anticipated that the Commission will grant approval subject to
the terms of the proposed agreement between the Forest Preserves and the WC.
The proposed agreement includes a license fee of $2,500.00 to be paid by the Preserves. In addition to the license
fee, the proposed agreement includes provisions that could result in additional future costs to the Preserves that are
unknown at this time. The Preserves will at its sole cost and expense be responsible for the maintenance of the
proposed trail. The proposed agreement also requires the Preserves to indemnify the railroad for any liability
resulting from the use of the trail on railroad property.
Contract period: Agreement effective until terminated.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $2,500.00
Account(s): Trail Accounts 25-6780, 51-6780, 52-6780, 54-6780 & 60-6780
