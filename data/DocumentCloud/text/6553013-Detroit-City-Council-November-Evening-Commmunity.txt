HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL
RE: Fees for Processing Rezoning Requests (RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

This report provides an analysis and recommendation from the City Planning Commission (CPC)
for a new fee schedule for processing rezoning requests and other land use reviews for Your
consideration.

In January 1995, City Council first established fees for the CPC processing rezoning requests,
and, since that time, these fees have never been increased. For this report, the City Planning
Commission studied the land use fees charged by other City of Detroit departments, estimated
the costs of processing land use requests, and surveyed the fees charged by other cities.

Background and Current Fees

For the past 24 years, the CPC has charged applicants for the processing of rezoning requests a
base fee of $350 plus $25 for each acre over one acre, to a maximum of $1,000.

For the past several years, the CPC has had three different rezoning applications:
(1) standard zoning changes;
(2) development proposal approval in the Planned Development (PD), Public Center (PC),
and Public Center Adjacent and,
(3) Special Development District, Casinos and Casino Complexes (SDS).
Even though the PD and SD5 amendments usually require significantly more staff hours, the
same $350 fee has been charged for all three applications.

Also, oftentimes land is already zoned PD, PC, PCA, or SDS, and developers request to make
minor or major changes to the subject property. In these instances, CPC staff conducts a special
district review to be reviewed by the CPC and/or City Council, and to date, has not charged a
fee. Lastly, regarding text amendments, most Zoning Ordinance text amendments originate from
CPC staff or are requested by City Council or City agency. However, some text amendment
requests come from the public, for which no fee is charged.

Land Use Fees Charged bv Other Citv of Detroit Departments

In late 1994, when the City Council was deciding whether or not to establish rezoning fees, the
Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environment Department (BSEED) was already charging

$450 for Special Land Use hearings and the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) was charging $300
to process variance requests. Presently, BSEED charges $1,000 for Special Land Use hearings
and $160 for Preliminary Plan Review (PPR). BZA currently charges $1,200 to process variance
requests. The Flaming Development Department presently does not charge for its
site plan review or special district review services.

Estimated CPC Staff Costs

The CPC studied the steps involved when processing various land use requests and projected the
average number of staff hours devoted to each step. However, the total hours can vary more or
less depending on the complexity of the particular land use review. The table below summarizes
the estimated total planning staff hours spent on the various land use requests. Based on the
current average salary of a Legislative Policy Division Planner of $36.78 per hour, the
estimated staff costs are listed as well. For this analysis, major review is de?ned as
substantial changes to several aSpects of a building, including the facade, signage, etc. 
minor review includes changes that are limited to one aspect of a building such as a new sign,
outdoor caf?, etc.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Estimated Total Estimated CPC
CPC Hours Costs
Standard Rezoning 61 $2,244
PD (including PD Major 78 $2,869
Modi?cation), SDS, SD4 (3 or more
acres), PC or PCA Rezoning 
Major Plan Review 25.5 $938
Minor Plan Review 11.5 $423
Zoning Text Amendment Major 66 $2,427 
Zoning Text Amendment Minor 42 $1,545

 

 

Attachment A shows a more detailed table summarizing estimated average staff hours to process
land use requests. The bottom of Attachment A also lists estimated hours from other
departments, which adds hundreds of dollars to the cost of each review.

Survey of Cities

Back in 1994, in order to establish the initial rezoning fee, CPC staff conducted a survey of 25
municipalities in Michigan and found fees ranging from $150 to $600. For the current analysis,
CPC staff conducted a survey of the following:

0 Eleven major US cities (most of which are in the Midwest or just beyond),

I The 21 largest cities in Michigan (which includes ?ve cities in Wayne County), and

- Twenty-two remaining other cities in Wayne County.

Attached to this report is a spreadsheet summarizing the survey results. The survey lists the fees
for the following: 1) standard rezoning; 2) PD rezoning; 3) zoning text amendment; and 4.) site

plan review.

A summary of some of the major ?ndings of the survey include the following:

0 Seven of 11 major US cities, have standard rezoning fees starting at a minimum
of $1,000, with the median fee of $1,500. Fees from other major US cities
include Chicago Pittsburgh and Milwaukee 

0 Four of the 11 major US cities charge additional fees based on the number of
acres;

a Six of the 11 major US cities have equal or higher fees for PD rezonings, with the
average fee being $2,416. PD fees from other cities include Chicago 
Milwaukee and Columbus 

I Three of the 11 major US cities list speci?c zoning text amendment fees,
including $500 from Denver, $1,180 from Nashville, and $1,500 from Charlotte;

0 Eleven of the 21 largest Michigan cities have rezoning fees $1,000 or greater with
the median fee at $1,500. Fees from other large Michigan cities, include
South?eld Warren and Grand Rapids 

0 Ten of the 21 largest Michigan cities charge higher fees for larger parcels or
additional acreage;

- Fourteen of the 21 largest Michigan cities list a different fee (mostly higher) for
PD rezonings fees from other cities, include Grand Rapids Warren
($2,500 for 2 acres or less plus $50 per acre) and Taylor 

- Eight of the 21 largest Michigan cities list speci?c text amendment fees ranging
from $330 for Kalamazoo to $2,921 for Grand Rapids;

- Eighteen of the 21 largest Michigan cities list speci?c fees for site plan approval,
including Pontiac ($500 preliminary and $990 ?nal), Warren and Grand
Rapids and,

0 Of the other Wayne County cities surveyed, seven of the 22 cities have rezoning
fees $1,000 or greater (including any escrow funds). Fees from other Wayne
County cities, include Romulus ($1,500) and Inkster 

Policir Issues

When CPC staff receives a rezoning map request, sometimes the petition is expanded to rezone
nearby properties or the entire block, and the CPC is often listed as a co-petitioner. In these
instances, the CPC recommends that unless the petition comes from a non-pro?t community-
based organization, the petitioner should still be responsible for paying a fee for the portion of
the rezoning they are requesting.

The vast majority of zoning text amendments originate from City staff or elected of?cials. If the
CPC receives a text amendment request from outside City government, then the CPC
recommends a fee be charged unless it is determined that the amendment has broad signi?cance
for the public good of the City.

For proposed fees, CPC recommends the following polices:

- If the CPC expands a rezoning request to include additional parcels, the petitioner should
be responsible for fees associated only with the original request;

- For text amendments, there should be a fee for requests originating outside City
government, but the fee should be waived if the CPC determines the amendment has
broad signi?cance for the public good of the City; and,

a Minor vs. major changes within PC and PCA district fees, and minor vs. major text
amendment fees be determined by the CPC staff.

Recommendation

The City Planning Commission recommends that rezoning fees should be increased and fees for
different types of land use requests should be added. The current fees established in 1995 have
not been raised for the past 24 years. At its meeting on October 17, 2019, the CPC voted to
recommend the following fees:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Recommended Fee

Standard Rezoning $1,500 for the ?rst acre $50 for each
additional acre to a maximum of

$2,250

PD, PD Major Plan Change $1,750 for ?rst acre $50 for each

SD4 (3 or more acres), SDS, PC, additional acre to a maximum of

and PCA Rezoning $2,500

Major Plan Review $700

Minor Plan Review $400

Text Amendment Major $1,500

Text Amendment Minor_ $1,000

 

 

The CPC thinks the proposed fees are fair and reasonable, in part, because they are in line with

fees charged by other City departments and other large cities in Michigan and throughout the US.

The proposed fees still only cover a portion of the actual costs accrued by the City when

processing land use requests. Attached is a resolution for Your Honorable Body?s consideration.

RE: Property Sale by Development Agreement
269, 281 and 291 Winder, 2515 Brush

Honorable City Council:

The City of Detroit Planning and Development Department has received an
Offer from MHT Housing, Inc. (?Developer?), a Michigan nonpro?t corporation, tO purchase
certain City-owned real property at 269, 281 and 291 Winder and 2515 Brush, Detroit, MI
(collectively the Properties?) for the purchase price of either: (1) One Million and 00/100
Dollars (?Purchase Money?) or (2) certain real property at 3430 and 3436 Third
(?Acquisition Properties?) that Developer has an assignable option to acquire.

The Developer proposes to construct a mixed-use development with approximately 60-80
affordable rental units on the A3 Properties. The Developer?s proposed use of the A3 Properties
shall be consistent with zoning, which currently is PD-H (Planned Historic District).

The Acquisition Properties must ?rst become vacant before the Developer can exercise its option
and such properties can become available to the City. In the event the Acquisition Properties are
not vacated, the City will accept the Purchase Money in exchange for the A3 Properties. The
Acquisition Properties are adjacent on both sides to other City-owned properties, which would
make the total site approximately 1.25 acres Of prime developable land in Midtown. The City
would work to market the site for viable mixed-use development proposals.

We request that your Honorable Body adopt the attached resolution to authorize the 
Director, or his authorized designee, to execute a development agreement, deed and such other
documents as may be necessary or convenient to effect a transfer of the A3 Properties by the City
to the Developer in exchange for either the Purchase Money or the Acquisition Properties.

Respectfully submitted,

Exhibit A incorporated herein, to MHT Housing, Inc. (?Developer?), a Michigan nonpro?t
corporation, for the purchase price of either: (1) One Million and 00/100 Dollars 
(?Purchase Money?) or (2) certain real property at 3430 and 3436 Third (together the ?Acquisition
Properties?), as more particularly described in the attached Exhibit incorporated herein; and be
it further

RESOLVED, that the Director of the Planning and Development Department or his
authorized designee, is authorized to execute a development agreement and issue a quit claim deed
for the sale of the A3 Properties, as well as execute such other documents as may be necessary or
convenient to effect the transfer of the A3 Properties to Developer for either the Purchase Money
or the Acquisition Properties consistent with this resolution; and be it further

RESOLVED, that the development agreement shall obligate Developer to cause a mixed-use

of tender of possession of particular parcels) in the event that changes are required to correct minor
inaccuracies or are required due to unforeseen circumstances or technical matters that may arise
prior to the conveyance of the A3 Properties, provided that the changes do not materially alter the
substance or terms of the transfer and sale; and be it further

RESOLVED, that in order for the City to accept the Acquisition Properties, the City must ?rst:
(1) conduct an environmental inquiry of the Acquisition Properties and, if required an

RE: City of Detroit Transaction with Micheal Kelly regarding FCA Project

The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) has been requested to provide a report on the information
that was provided by the Administration with regard to the transaction between the City of
Detroit (City) and Michael G. Kelly (Kelly Entities) as it relates to the Fiat of America
(FCA) land assemblage.

In May 2019, the City was engage in assembling approximately 215 acres of land for the $1.6
billion, FCA Assembly Plant Project. Of the total amount of acreage needed, approximately 0.3
acres of land within the FCA Assembly Plant Project was owned by Kelly Entities. The Duggan
Administration negotitiated a deal to acquire the necessary property from Kelly Entities. The
Administration presented to City Council for approval on April 30, 2019 the sale of 6 parcels to
Kelly Entities in exchange for the transfer of 3873, 3963 and 4621 St Jean and 5732 Winslow to
the Detroit Brown?eld Authority (DBRA). The Administration requested an amendment to this
transaction to add one additional parcel to the list of properties Kelly Entities would transfer to
the DBRA and remove ?ve parcel and add one parcel to the list of properties the City would
transfer to Kelly Enterprises. It was at this time as identi?ed in the memorandum dated May 3,
2019, from the then Director of Plannint and Development Department Maurice Cox, that the
proposed amended transaction included provisions to:

?settle with the Kelly Entities certain in personam actions for property tax
liabilities for the tax years 2015 and prior, as well as settles certain blight
violations wit the Kelly Entities for all years prior to the approval date of the
attached resolutions.? No further details related by the ?personam actions for
property tax? or blight violations were provided in this initial correspondence.

The Property Transfer Agreement between the City, the DBRA and Michael Kelly (relative to
the FCA project) under Section 2, Releases: Subsection B, City Entities Release, provides in
pertinent part:

The City Entities RELEASE AND FOREVER DISCHARGE the Kelly 
and those entities associated with City of Detroit Mortgage Code #00313, that
releate to any real?property tax debts of any kind or nature for any year prior to
2016, and blight violations (including any and all demolition-related claims)
issued or incurred prior to the execution or effective date of this Agreement,
whichever is later (the ?Released Matters?). This release is expressly limited to
those alleged and/or accrued debts of any kind or nature, whether known or
unknown, relating to real-property taxes alleged to have been due at any time
prior to December 31, 2015, and for blight violations (including any and all
demolition-related claims) issued or incurred that were issued at any time prior to
the execution date of this Agreement, whichever is later.

LPD notes that neither the memorandum, the Property Transfer Agreement nor any
conversations with the Administration identi?ed the nature of the unpaid blight violations or the
types of properties involved. There was discussion as to the amount of the combined violations
and lawsuits being settled, which were determined to be in excess of $1 million. This amount
was outlined in May 14, 2019 report summarizing the FCA Mack Assembly Project
Report'. At the time the transaction was being presented for approval, the number of blight
violations and the nature of those violations were never brought forth by the Administration.
Only the approximate amount of the settlement and the transfer of properties by the parties were
disclosed along with the fact that the transaction involved 0.3 acres of land directly in the project
footprint.

LPD notes that the amount of the settlement and property maintenance violations that were
forgiven in this transaction in retrospection is signi?cant. However, in light of the $1.6 billion
project and the potential 5,000 jobs the project would bring, the Kelly Entities transaction would
be a necessary undertaking and was not prominent in review, particularly when the details
underlying the blight violations were not disclosed. But it must be noted that the resolution of
past debt owed would not relieve Mr. Kelly (or the af?liated entities) of his current and ongoing
responsibilities under the City?s Property Maintenance Code or any other local, state or federal
law which applies to the rental of his vast real estate portfolio. The transaction also does not
preclude the City of Detroit from conducting the appropriate property inspections and taking
appropriate actions, including but not limited to shutting down properties that are un?t for
habitation. LPD would be happy to provide further information and/or analysis should City
Council so desire.

RE: FCA US LLC, Mack Assembly Project Report

The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) has reviewed the Agreement for the Development of
Mack Assembly Plant (the Development Agreement) between CA US, LLC (FCA) the Detroit
Brown?eld Redevelopment Authority (DBRA), and the City of Detroit (City). This report
provides a highlight of the pertinent provisions of the Agreement as well as some of the
underlying elements undertaken to bring the project to fruition.

LPD notes that the Mack Assembly Plant Project is composed of a number of complex
components which include but are not limited to: land acquisitions; land transfer agreements;
intricate ?nancial agreements and arrangements, employment agreements and plans; and
community bene?t agreement provisions. A summary and outline of the Project may not
encompass the essence and gravity of each component. LPD submits this report to assist in
reaching an understanding of the Project, however, the true gravamen of the Project can only be
ascertained by the persons who crafted the terms and conditions of each connecting part. 1

Summary of CA Project
The Parties have come together and negotiated a way in which to bring about the construction

and development of the FCA Assembly Plant project. In the construction of the assembly plant,
FCA anticipates a total expenditure of approximately $1.6 billion and the expected creation of

 

Due to the complexities and overlapping interlocking nature of these various land deals and agreements LPD
would ask that City Council request the aid and assistance of the City?s Law Department and Outside Counsel who
prepared or assisted in the preparation of these many documents to participate ?Illy in bringing need clarity thereto.
The Administration?s summary of the FCA Agreement is attached for City Councils convenience.



approximately three thousand eight hundred ?fty (3,850) net new full time employees in the
operation of the FCA Assembly Plant. In addition to the construction and assembly of the Mack
Assembly Plant, FCA intends to expend $900 million to retool and modernize the existing
Jefferson North Assembly Plant creating another 1,100 jobs and bringing the total number of net
new jobs to approximately 4,950 and total investment in the area to approximately $2.5 billion to
Detroit. The City and the DBRA have agreed to assist in facilitating this project and together the
parties have undertaken certain obligations.

In order to secure commitment to the project, the City and the DBRA entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), dated February 26, 2019. Under the MOU the City and
DBRA agreed to facilitate as well as provide a number of things including, but not limited to:
securing certain private parcels of land; provide certain publicly owned land; obtain approvals
for rezoning; funding for land acquisition costs; complete environmental reviews and provide
remedial plans where necessary; complete the process for a PA 198 tax abatement agreement
(expected to be worth approximately $12 million to FCA over 12 years); work closely together
to support Detroit?s Community Bene?ts process and reach ?nal recommendations on
community bene?ts; and obtaining ?nal approvals that will be required for the Brown?eld
Redevelopment Plan.2 All rights and liabilities under the MOU will be terminated upon the
Effective Date of the Agreement for the Development of FCA Assembly Plant.

Land Acquisition

Under the MOU and the Development Agreement, the City and DBRA was to acquire certain
private parcels necessary for the FCA Assembly Plant project. Some parcels would be acquired
through the purchasing with cash, while others would require a land swap transfer of
publicly owned property or both cash and land swap transfer of publicly owned property.3 The
publicly owned property would be parcels of land owned by the City or the Detroit Land Bank
(DLBA). The City entered into Land Transfer Agreements to cobble together approximately 215
acres of land for the FCA Assembly Plant proj ect.4 According to the Administration, the City
agreement provides for 155 acres of City-owned land to be swapped and $48.1 million of cash to

 

2 The State of Michigan has made a separate commitment to complete its process for State incentives during the
same period. If these obligations are met and the parties enter into a ?nal development agreement, FCA will start
construction immediately in order to make its production deadline. The City has made an additional commitment to
begin moving dirt from the berm along St. Jean immediately. That work will need to be done to reuse that property
for FCA or for any other development. If the City is unable to secure the land required by FCA in the 60 day
timetable FCA and the City will split the cost of the berm removal.
1? The land swaps include properties that are outside of the impact area in communities that were not provided any
notice ofthe exchange. Although some areas may result in future community bene?t engagement when redeveloped.

Total $107.6

The breakdown of the land transactions to acquire the property to provide to CA for the
assembly plant project are as follows:

0 The City assembled 55.6 acres of adjacent City owned property that consist of
parcels identi?ed as the North and South Berms on the west side of St. Jean, (24.9
Acres valued at $383,992); St. Jean Street (12.6 acres valued at $115,508); the
Federal Mogul site across from DDOT Shoemaker facility (14.4 acres valued at
$521,805 and a parcel off St. Jean that connects to the parking lot north of Mack
engine plant (1.2 acres valued at $51,444). The total value of the City?s land
contribution is $1,072,749. These evaluations were determined in accordance with
the ?Land Values from the City Assessor records?. The information provided by
the Duggan Administration?s answers to questions from April 30, 2019.

0 The acquisition of the DTE owned property at its Conner Creek site and at 11860
Freud consisting of 41 .4 acres was obtained in a land swap deal for 25.1 acres
which includes 1340 third Street (PLD Building of 0.9 acres); 9733 Grinnell (13.1
acres); 14584 Livernois (5.7 acres) Winslow/Lawton parcels (1.8 acres) 11900
Freud (2.6 acres); and 2 Canal (1.0 acres). DTE will demolish the existing
structure at Conner Creek. The DTE site along with the GLWA and Conrail
parcels will be used as a ?nished vehicle parking lot.6

 

5 According to the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation the property values were determined by comparable
market rates in the area as well as an independent appraisal for the parcels and the DTE Connors
Creek property.

6 The City is responsible for assembling the site as well as constructing the parking lot before transferring the
property to FCA. LPD notes we were unable to identify any reference to the cost of constructing the parking lot.

3

I The acquisition of the Great Lakes Water Authority owned property consist of
10.8 vacant acres at Freud Street for the purchase price of $1 million.

I The acquisition of Soave Enterprises (Soave) property was made pursuant to a
land swap agreement. Soave provided two parcels located at 12001 Mack and
12017 Mack to be provided as part of the new CA assembly plant for employee
parking. In exchange for the two Mack parcels Soave is to receive 9.5 acres at
and Van Dyke and pay $280,000 which will go into escrow for site
development. In addition, Soave will receive 12.8 acres at Van Dyke and Huber
adjacent to the DWSD Huber Yard and the City will receive 3.2 acres of property
to square off the DWSD Huber site and $768,000. Soave will also obtain a 2-year
option on 9 acres of City owned parcels at 10600 Gratiot, 10644 Gratiot and the
1.7 acre State owned parcel at 10780 Gratiot (the concrete parking area only). The
$280,000 escrowed money can be used for site preparation.7

I The acquisition of Hantz Group properties consist of 3.7 acres of land adjacent to
the South Berrn on Beniteau Street to be used for a stormwater retention and
additional parking. In exchange Hantz will receive approximately 1.7 acres of
land in the area west of the CA JNAP plant. The Hantz transaction was
conducted 1n conjunction with the prior C1ty/ Hantz land transaction where Hantz
had an option to buy 180 additional acres outside the original Hantz footprint. 8
The City (through the DBRA) as part of the FCA pr0j ect land swap is selling 40?
45 acres of land to Hantz within the original footprint.

- The acquisition of the DPS parcel consisting of 0.1 acre located adjacent to the
South Berm to be used for the retention pond and additional parking.

0 The acquisition of Crown Enterprises property consist of an 82 acre parcel
adjacent to the Jefferson North Assembly Plant that Crown currently leases to
FCA. The acquisition cost totals $54 million which includes $43.5 million in cash
and $10.5 million in land.9 The land swap consist of 116.6 acres of City owned
land. Included is 1.9 acres of land in the bridge area valued at $148,521; 14.5

 

7 The escrow dollars can be used for site prep which includes, for Soave entities: cost of eligible activities under the
Brown?eld Act, above $150,000 for any of the three purchase areas; Purchase of private parcels up to $250,000
total; quiet title costs in excess of QTA Cap (DBRA covers quiet title cost up to $50,000 on City property). For City:
up to $100,000 to be used by DBRA for purchase of State parcel under Road Land Agreement; Any
remaining funds in escrow at the expiration of escrow period to be disbursed pro?rata to City, DBRA and EDC for
sale of properties owned by them.
8 The original Hantz land purchase boundaries were from Jefferson to Mack and Fischer to St. Jean but allowed for
an option to buy an additional 180 acres outside of the original boundaries. The 40-45 acres are being sold to Hantz
at the price set under the original agreement. The sale also terminates the original option.
9 This 82 acre parcel of land (Former Budd Plant Site) sits in the middle of the FCA Assembly Plant project
footprint and is currently leased by FCA. It is understanding that the underlying lease between Crown and
FCA has a value of $21 million. The land swap agreement with Crown discounts the 82 acre site at $54 million
($43.5 million in cash and $10.5 million in land). If the City provides the property identi?ed in the I-94 Industrial
area that is located near another property that Crown leases to FCA on Georgia Street (required for expansion), the
discount for the 82 acre site is applied. If the City is unable to provide the property as set forth in the Property
Exchange Agreement the $21 million will be due of which $15 million the Cit},r is responsible and $6 million IS the

likely are we able to avoid paying out these contingency funds.

Community Bene?ts Agreement

As set forth by City Ordinance under Chapter 14, Article XII, certain development projects
referred to as ?Tier 1 Development Projects? are required to undergo community engagement
procedures to determine how the development project may impact the community. As a
result of the community engagement with Neighborhood Advisory Council (N AC) certain
assurances and bene?ts have been made by the FCA and the City which have been set forth
in a formal Community Bene?ts Agreement entered into between the City and FCA.

LPD notes that the Community Bene?ts Agreement is a stand-alone agreement and is not
incorporated by reference to the FCA Development Agreement. 12 The pertinent provision of
the Community Bene?ts Agreement are highlighted below:

Neighborhood Stabilization Impact Area

 

?0 The Yahiayan property is currently used for parking by the adjacent retail center. The easements that were
connected to the property are being extinguished and the FCA will use the parcel along with two of the Soave
parcels for employee parking.

It is understanding that the unpaid taxes owed by Kelly totaled approximately $1 million.

The Development Agreement with FCA

LPD has provided a brief summary of some of the provisions of the Development Agreement, a
more detailed review is provided later. During the Planning and Economic Development
Committee, there was discussion regarding some of the following:

Section 3.12 Parcel 10 Property Exchange Agreement

This provision provides that the DBRA. City and FCA entered into a Property Exchange
Agreement with Crown Enterprises regarding the purchase price of Parcel 10 (Former
Budd Plant). The property sits in the middle of the FCA Project footprint and FCA currently
leases the property ?om Crown. The purchase price of Parcel 10 has been reduced to $54 million
($43.5 million cash and 10.5 million in land swapped property). Under the PEA, it appears the
City agees to convey to Crown prOperty located in the 1?94 Industrial Park (an area where CA
leases additional property from Crown and the 1-94 prOperty is needed for anticipated
expansion). If the cannot provide the I-94 property, the purchase price for Parcel 10
increases an additional $21 million. The method in which the payment of the $21 million is
tendered is set forth in Section and Under subsection the City is responsible
for $15 million which will be added on to the Municipal Project Funds solely for this payment.
Subsection provides that FCA will be responsible for the remaining $6 million. If the
conveyance of the I-94 property transaction is not completed due to failure to
consummate the transaction for reasons other than the removal of the Property from the city
property, then FCA is responsible for the $21 million.

Section 7.02(b) provides that FCA is subject to the Executive Order providing for 51% of the
work to be done by Detroit residents and 30% of the contracts be awarded to Detroit Contractors.
The Agreement provides that the City acknowledges that it has entered into enhanced
recruitment agreements with the skilled trades unions that will reduce the payments under the
Executive Orders, if FCA engages the skilled trade unions when seeking workers for
construction. The City also agrees to work collaboratively with FCA to facilitate compliance
with the Executive orders.

Section 7.03(d) Mack Assembly Plant Application Process: provides that the Detroit
Employment Solutions Corporation (DESC) agrees to support FCA in its talent needs in
recruiting, pre-screening and vetting, work-readiness training related to Production Jobs. The
Agreement provides that priority will be given to UAW Candidates (in accordance with the
UAW Collective Bargaining Contract)?. Detroit residents will be given priority17 after the UAW
Candidates. The priority to Detroit residents occurs in two instances: initial application
priority (after UAW Candidates) will be given ?rst to Detroit residents in the Project?s impact
area (including returning citizens and veterans), then to other Detroit Residents (including

 

?5 LPD was not in receipt of the PEA or the Letter agreement between CA and Crown which details the terms and
conditions that must satis?ed regarding the I-94 Property.

?6 LPD notes that due to FCA having collective bargaining contracts with the UAW that provide priority status to its
members, FCA legally cannot contractually commit to giving another party priority over its prior legal obligation.
The fact that the City is aware of the prior contractual commitment, should the City attempt to interfere with that
commitment could arguably make the City liable for ?Tortious Interference of a Contract?.

1??While the term priority is not de?ned in the Agreement, as de?ned in Black?s Law Dictionary, ?Priority? means: A
legal preference or precedence. When two persons have similar rights in respect of the same subject-matter, but one
is entitled to exercise his right to the exclusion of the other, he is said to have priority.

returning citizens and veterans); (ii) hiring priority (after UAW Candidates), FCA will prioritize
hiring for quali?ed Detroit residents with the assistance of DESC providing a list of candidates
that meet basic job requirements. LPD notes, FCA has not provided any speci?c number
of Detroit residents that will be hired which may be mostly due to the unknown number of UAW
Candidates that may vie for the newly opened positions. As indicated the Detroit resident priority
takes second to those candidates.

Section 10.4(d) Payment Shortfall: provides that if on the Monitoring Termination Date?. The
cumulative Annual City Revenue (total amount of projected City revenue as set forth in Exhibit
10.4, is less than the Monitoring Investment Value the CA shall pay the City the
shortfall within 30 days of the receipt of an invoice from the City (subject to setoffs as detailed
below). Under the provision, at the end of 29 years if the City has not obtained in the cumulative
Annual City Revenue the projected $57,400,000 then FCA will pay the difference between What
was the actual and the projected amount.
