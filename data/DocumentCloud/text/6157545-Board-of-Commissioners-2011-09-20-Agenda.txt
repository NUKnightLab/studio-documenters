Could only use accounts that still had available funding.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from ______.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
All of the accounts were budgeted for what we spent in FY2010 and what we anticipated to spend
in FY2011. Due to the large volume of appeals we received this year; we had to postpone all
seminars and classes (050-186 Account). Membership fees (050-185 Account) were prorated due
to one of the Commissioners coming in February. The Board had fewer meetings which impacted
the number of times we needed a court reporter (050-268 Account) and we spent less on advertising
(050-245) because we opened larger groups of towns at one time. We are anticipating to have
larger mailings after November (050-225Account).
