DEBARMENT OF BUS COMPANY
THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER REPORTS THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATION:

That the Board of Education of the City of Chicago ("Board? permanently debar Jewel?s Bus Company
(?Respondent?) from doing any business with the Board.

The Board?s Chief Procurement Of?cer served Respondent with a Notice of Debarment, on November 15,

2017, initiating a debarment proceeding against it, based upon Respondent's violations of contractual

provisions and the Board's debarment and ethics policies. Speci?cally, between 2010 and 2011,

Respondent used vans instead of buses in violation of its contract with the Board and created a potential

safety issue for the students transported in these vans. This conduct violated its contractual provisions.

Sections 401 and 2(k) of the Boards Policy Manual and Sections 503.1 (V) of the

Board' 5 PoliCy Manual. Further, between 2008 and 2012, Respondent overbilled the Board an estimated

$3 million dollars. The bills submitted by Respondent were false and/or exaggerated and thereby violated

the contractual provisions, Sections and 2(k) of
the Board?s Policy Manual and Sections 503.1(lV) and-(V) of the Board?s PolicyManual. Lastly, Respondent

misrepresented its ?nancial status and failed to pay debts it oirred in violation of contractual and policy

provisions. Speci?cally, at a July 23, 2013 meeting, Respondent requested an extension of time to post the

bond required under the 2013 Contact claiming it owed nearly $2 million to the Internal Revenue Service

At that same meeting, the Board raised discrepancieswith Respondent?s 2011 ?nances. On,
October 2, 2014i the Board received a levy from the IRS against any future payments from the Board to

Respondent until Respondents paid the IRS more than $2.3 million dollars"; Respondent?s

misrepresentation of its ?nancial status and failure to pay debtswere violations of its cOntract and section,
and 2(k) of' the Board?s Policy Manual. The Chief Administrative

Of?cer has reviewed the record (as de?ned in section 4.5(10) of the Board Policy) and recommends

permanent debannent.

Based on the facts set forth in the record as de?ned in sectionl4.5(10) of the Board policy, the Chief
Administrative Of?cer recommends that the Board permanently debar Respondent from doing any business
with the Board effective immediately. All existing contracts between the Board and Respondent are
