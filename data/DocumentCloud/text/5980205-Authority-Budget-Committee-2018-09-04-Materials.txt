Executive Director’s Comments
Director Maki said ICJIA had not yet received its FFY17 Justice Assistance Grant (JAG)
award. He said staff has had little communication with the U.S. Department of Justice
and has little information about when ICJIA might receive the FFY17 award.
Mr. Stevens said grantees are using FFY13, FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 JAG funds to
operate their programs. He said at the September 4, 2018, Budget Committee meeting,
staff will request six-month designations of JAG funding to continue current programs as
there is not enough JAG money left to support grants beyond six months.

 8/14/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 3

1. Minutes of the June 21, 2018, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Hon. Robb moved to approve the minutes of the June 21, 2018, Budget
Committee Meeting. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
2. State Appropriated Programs
Mr. Stevens referred the Budget Committee members to a memo dated August 14,
2018, regarding State Appropriated Programs.
A. Community – Law Enforcement Partnership for Deflection & Substance Use
Disorder Treatment Notice of Funding Opportunity
Ms. Murphy said that the Community-Law Enforcement Partnership for Deflection &
Substance Use Disorder Treatment (CLEP) program received a $500,000 appropriation
in the SFY19 budget. She said CLEP is a police-led deflection program in which law
enforcement acts as a referral service to help individuals access treatment and that the
goal of CLEP is to build referral capacity. Staff requested making the $500,000
appropriation available for a competitive, standardized Notice of Funding Opportunity
(NOFO) for CLEP program awards. She said the opportunity would be available to law
enforcement agencies throughout Illinois and was scheduled for release August 30,
2018, with programs running from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019. She added grants
would be made for a minimum of $20,000 and a maximum of $80,000. Two years of
further funding would be available pending performance evaluation and available
funding, she said. She noted the NOFO would only be released if the Community-Law
Enforcement Partnership for Deflection and Addiction Treatment Act became law.
Members discussed that many state-appropriated programs do not include set-asides for
ICJIA administrative expenses and that work relating to these programs must be
assigned to ICJIA staff who are paid with general revenue funds. Director Maki
suggested that ICJIA Board members send a letter to the state’s appropriations chair
requesting an increase in general revenue funds to support administrative activities. He
said more funds appropriated for programs means more work and under the new Grant
Accountability and Transparency Act, grantmaking has become more complicated and
labor intensive.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve making the $500,000 SFY19 CLEP appropriation
available for a NOFO. Hon. Robb seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

 8/14/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 4

B - Death Penalty Abolition Act Fund
Ms. Brennan said Death Penalty Abolition (DPA) Act funds can only support services
to survivors of homicide victims and law enforcement officer training. She said two
NOFOs were under development; one for providers of services to survivors of homicide
victims across Illinois and another for law enforcement officer training on focused
deterrence, implicit bias, and procedural justice. She said staff would consider other
priorities, as requested.
Motion: Hon. Robb moved to approve making the $6,500,000 SFY19 DPA fund
appropriation available for two NOFOs, as described. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
C - Duane Dean Behavioral Health Center Fund
Mr. Hoffman said that the Duane Dean Behavioral Health Center received a SFY19
line-item appropriation of $400,000. He said the center’s community diversion program
will incorporate community education and trainings, cognitive behavioral counseling,
medication-assisted therapy, case managers, a peer support specialist, and recovery
coaches. He said the program seeks to employ a broad-based comprehensive approach
in Kankakee County to educate and increase access to services to the local criminal
justice systems, the local community, and individuals with opioid use disorder.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to designate the $400,000 SFY19 appropriation to the Duane
Dean Behavioral Health Center to support its community diversion program. Mr. Olson
seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
D – Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal Fund
Ms. Brennan said earlier this year, ICJIA asked the Illinois Sheriff’s Association (ISA)
and the Illinois Association of Chief of Police (IACP) to consider procuring drug
disposal kits with SFY18 Prescription Pill and Drug Disposal (PPDD) funding on behalf
of their member agencies, since the negotiation and execution of many grants smaller
than $2,000 each would be onerous for both ICJIA and the recipient agencies. She said
ISA accepted and agreed to make the kits available to ISA and IACP members. She said
the ISA agreed to take on the role again this year using the $150,000 SFY19 PPDD
appropriation.
Motion: Mr. Kocerka moved to designate the $150,000 SFY19 PPDD appropriation to
the ISA for statewide distribution. Mr. O’Grady seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

 8/14/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 5

E – Safer Foundation Fund
Mr. Hoffman said Safer Foundation seeks to implement a violence prevention program
by providing employment opportunities to at-risk individuals. He said Safer Foundation
will recruit, screen, and prepare program participants for sustainable employment in
auto mechanics, food service/culinary arts, woodworking/cabinetry, consumer goods
manufacturing, construction, and media.
Motion: Ms. Hora moved to designate the $500,000 SFY19 appropriation to the Safer
Foundation to support its violence prevention program. Hon. Robb seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Mr. Kocerka.
3. Victims of Crime Act FFY15, FFY16, and FFY17
Mr. Stevens referred Budget Committee members to a memo dated August 14, 2018,
regarding FFY15, FFY16, and FFY17 Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) plans.
A. Designation Reduction
Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt said the Southern Illinois Health Care Foundation’s
Services to Downstate Victims of Crime program returned $4,439 in FFY15 funds to
ICJIA due to personnel issues. He said the FFY15 funds, which expire on September 30,
2018, would be returned to the U.S Office for Victims of Crime.
Motion: Mr. Kocerka moved to approve the recommended FFY15 VOCA designation
reduction. Mr. Olson seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
B. Recommended Designations
Services to Victims of Domestic Violence
Mr. Reichgelt said staff recommended designating $455,000 in FFY16 funds to the
Chicago Department of Family and Support Services to support the Statewide Domestic
Violence Hotline.
Transitional Housing
Mr. Reichgelt said ICJIA issued a NOFO seeking applications for the development or
enhancement of transitional housing for victims of domestic violence and/or human
trafficking. He said 11 of 19 applicants were recommended for funding by the review
panel. He said the recommended 18 months of funding would complete the 36 months
of funding passed by the board. He said at the end of the 36-month period, staff will

6

 8/14/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 6

evaluate the transitional housing program and determine whether funds should be
offered again for the program in the future.
He noted goals and objectives described in the meeting materials were in addition to
what the grantees must respond to in OVC’s Performance Measuring Tool. Director
Maki said that the additional reporting allows for better analysis of the relationship
between grantee activity and the provision of qualitative services.
Ms. Hora said that she would rather see tangible numbers represented than percentages
to get a better idea of actual activity.
Dr. Alderden said GATA operates under the assumption that three years is an
appropriate programming timeframe. She said what is really needed is a pre-planning
period and then a program period of up to five years to allow programs to be fully
implemented and evaluated for process and outcomes.
Child Abuse, Financial Crime, and Impaired Driving
Mr. Reichgelt said child abuse and impaired driving programs were part of a NOFO
intended to serve as a catch-all for VOCA-eligible program types. He said the
designations constituted funding for the second of three 12-month periods for each of
the five programs.
Ms. Hora requested an explanation of the numbers in the child abuse programs’
performance reports; she said they appeared to be lower than expected.
Megan Mahoney, representing Heartland Alliance, said that a major challenge is finding
licensed clinicians who will accept the comparatively low-paying therapist positions in
these programs. Often, the positions go unfilled, causing delays in program
implementation and operation.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY16 designations for the
Statewide Domestic Violence Hotline and child abuse and impaired driving programs and
the recommended FFY17 designations for transitional housing programs, as described in
the memo. Mr. Olson seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

MEMORANDUM

TO:

Budget Committee Members

FROM:

Greg Stevens, Acting Associate Director, Federal and State Grants Unit

DATE:

September 4, 2018

RE:

Bullying Prevention

In the State Fiscal Year 2019 budget, Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
(ICJIA) received a $443,000 appropriation for bullying prevention grants and
administrative costs that must be expended by June 30, 2019.
Bullying prevention research has shown programs must address the school climate and
culture, in addition to specific bullying behaviors (Child Safety Network August 8, 2018,
webinar). Evidence-based programs include school-wide messaging, events, and
consistent modeling from staff as the essential foundation to any interventions. This
approach is consistent with Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) used
throughout Illinois schools, social and emotional learning standards in Illinois state
statute (Section 15(a) of Public Act 93-0495), and general violence prevention
frameworks (primary, secondary and tertiary).
Last fall, ICJIA received a discretionary award from the U.S. Office of Victims of Crime:
Vision 21 Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth Demonstration Project. The
Illinois project, Illinois HEALS (Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems), offers the
state a unique opportunity to complete a needs assessment and implement innovative
pilots that improve the identification and coordination of services for children and youth
impacted by violence in Cook County and the southeastern region of Illinois. Staff
propose to use Bullying Prevention funds through one or more grants to Illinois HEALS
pilot locations to support trauma-aware schools. These schools will be essential
screening, referral, and service locations for Illinois HEALS. By utilizing the bullying
prevention funds to create trauma-aware schools, ICJIA is contributing to a learning
collaborative that can be shared with other areas of the state and/or federal partners. It
also leverages Bullying Prevention funds by ensuring the activities are part of a larger
system of services that may receive other sources of funding.
Staff will be available at the Budget Committee meeting to answer any questions.

B. FFY14 DESIGNATION REALLOCATIONS TO FFY16
The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) very recently announced a rule change that all JAG
awards to states are now only eligible for a single one-year extension beyond their
originally scheduled period of performance end dates. Because of this rule change,
FFY14 JAG funds will expire on September 30, 2018, as ICJIA’s FFY14 award has
already received a year extension. ICJIA has a number of current open FFY14 JAG
grants that have period of performance end dates beyond September 30, 2018. These
grants will now be forced to end on September 30, 2018. To ensure that funding for these
grants continues uninterrupted, staff recommends reducing the FFY14 designations to the
amounts that these programs expect to spend by September 30, 2018 and designating
FFY16 funds to support the portions of these grants that extend beyond September 30,
2018, as described in the table below. These programs have been approved at prior
Budget Committee meetings. Only the funding source will change; the programs will not
be affected.

*The Springfield Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime designation described in
the table above would only actually need $48,404 in FFY16 funding to make up the prorated difference in FFY14 funds that their current grant will lose due to FFY14 expiring
on September 30, 2018. The current grant was originally scheduled to end on December
12, 2018. Staff had planned to introduce at the October 18, 2018 Budget Committee
meeting a designation recommendation to provide funding for this program for an
additional six months beyond December 12, 2018. To ease the administrative burdens
that would be incurred by issuing a three-month grant followed by a six-month grant,
staff recommends that these two relatively short grants be combined into one nine-month
grant in the amount of $146,933. Staff will recommend designations at the October 18,
2018 Budget Committee meeting for the other Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent
Crime programs to provide an additional six months of funding as originally scheduled;
those grants are not using FFY14 funds and are not subject to the need for reallocation as
is the case with the Springfield grant. Further information is available in the attached
Grant Recommendation Form.

C. RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
1. Human Trafficking Task Force – Fund Restoration
On August 18, 2016, the Budget Committee designated $108,866 in FFY14 local-use
funds to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office (CCSAO) to support its Human
Trafficking Task Force. On November 16, 2017, the Budget Committee acted to reduce
the designation by $28,305 for a revised designation of $80,561 to reflect final
expenditures charged to the agreement. Staff has since learned the amount of this
reduction was in error and the designation should only have been reduced by $26,491 for
a revised designation of $82,375. Therefore, staff recommends designating $1,814 in
FFY14 local-use funds to the CCSAO to restore the designation to $82,375.
2. Partnerships and Strategies to Reduce Violent Crime - Mobile Ballistic Test
Equipment
On November 16, 2017 the Budget Committee designated $159,303 in FFY16 funds to
the City of Champaign and $197,313 in FFY14 funds to the City of Springfield for Year
Two of their Focused Deterrence (FD) program Partnerships and Strategies to Reduce
Violent Crime. The FD program seeks to reduce gun-related violent crime through
strengthening municipal governmental collaboration and investigation, thus leading to the
increased trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Both
communities are requesting the purchase of an Acquisition Station, an Analysis Station,
and a Stereo Zoom Microscope, to allow them to utilize National Integrated Ballistic
Information Network (NIBIN) technology. This equipment will build the capacity of
local law enforcement to produce actionable gun-crime intelligence in a timely manner;
use ballistic intelligence to develop leads that will quickly identify perpetrators, repeat
offenders, and connect crimes; increase convictions for gun-related crimes; and reduce
the overall rate of gun related crimes. This equipment will work in conjunction with and
contribute to the overall objective of the FD program to reduce gun violence by
identifying shooters and the sources of guns used in crimes.
Staff recommends designating FFY13 as described in the table below to enhance the
current efforts of the FD programs described above.

3. Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program
The Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program supports a team of researchers in
three centers that identify priority criminal justice issues for the state, conduct research
and analysis on these areas, and disseminate information to guide decision-making
locally and within ICJIA. Staff recommends designating $178,788 in FFY15 and $86,329
in FFY16 state-use funds (for a total of $271,396) to continue support of this program for
a period of approximately five-and-a-half months during 2019.
4. Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics
On July 27, 2017, the Budget Committee approved the use of $4,096,245 in FFY13,
FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 JAG funds to fund police-led substance use
diversion/deflection programs, multijurisdictional large-scale narcotic trafficking
enforcement, and multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution programs. These funds
supported the first year of a potential three years of programming to the agencies. These
grant agreements end September 30, 2018.
Because the U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance has not awarded Illinois’s Federal Fiscal
Year 2017 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funds, JAG funds to
continue the Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics programs are
limited.
To maximize the use of available JAG funds and sustain the programs, staff recommends
making six-month designations as described in the table below. These amounts represent
only essential program costs. Once the Federal Fiscal Year 2017 JAG award is received,
staff will recommend an additional six-month designation, to complete the second year of
funding.
The attached Funding Briefs provide descriptions of the three program categories.

Program Description
The Partnerships and Strategies to Reduce Violent Crime program aims to reduce violent crime and strengthen
the relationship between law enforcement and communities. Initial grants for Year One were awarded for the
assessment process.
During first six months of the second year of funding, the program administrators conducted preparations to
hold the program’s first call-in and to implement the plan developed in Year One. They also focused on
conducting community engagement and media initiatives to garner stakeholder support for reducing shots fired,
reducing gun violence, and the Focused Deterrence program. During its third year, the program will refine the
Focused Deterrence program based upon lessons learned in Year Two and conduct a follow up survey and
analysis of the program post-implementation.
The below table shows the shooting crime statistics from 2017 through June 30, 2018. Confirmed shots fired
incidents decreased 29 percent citywide and 32 percent in the target area during that time.

Program Description
The purpose of the program is to enhance efforts of the Focused Deterrence (FD) Program in Champaign by
funding the purchase of an acquisition station, an analysis station, and a Stereo Zoom Microscope to utilize
National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) technology. This equipment and NIBIN technology
in partnership with local law enforcement agencies will quickly identify unlawfully used firearms and their
sources. This equipment will work in conjunction with and contribute to the overall objective of the FD
program to reduce gun violence by identifying shooters and their gun sources.
Also needed is a bullet catcher collection chamber, required for a functioning Integrated Ballistics Identification
System (IBIS) system. This piece of equipment would be purchased through a competitive bid process.
Program Activities
This program allows for a regional initiative for all of Champaign County and the Champaign FD program,
including local, state, and county law enforcement agencies and other partners, to integrate with the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Crime Gun Intelligence Center The infrastructure will be put into
place to ensure that (a) every firearm used feloniously is test fired and entered into NIBIN, (b) recovered
firearms are traced through e-Trace, and (c) that every shell casing and other ballistics that are recovered are
entered into NIBIN. This program will bolster the capacity of local law enforcement to produce actionable
crime gun intelligence in a timely manner, which directly correlates with our Champaign FD, a program to deter
firearm-related violence. In addition, this program will enhance the investigative ability of the Champaign
County Street Crimes Task Force to identify and arrest perpetrators of gun crimes, increase collaboration with
the ATF to rigorously investigate linked shooting incidents, and increase collaboration between police and
prosecutors.
Goals
The overall goal of the program is to bolster the success of the Champaign-Urbana Fresh Start focused
deterrence initiative by use of NIBIN system, crime gun tracing, personnel, partnerships, and other technologies
to identify shooters and their sources of guns. This equipment will build the capacity of local law enforcement
to produce actionable crime gun intelligence in a timely manner; use ballistic intelligence to develop leads that

Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Drugs: Year 2

Program Description
Law enforcement agencies have recognized that arrest and prosecution of low level drug users does not enhance
community safety or effectively reduce demand as those with substance use disorders repeatedly cycle through
the criminal justice system without treatment. In response, law enforcement agencies have crafted new models
to reduce demand by deflecting drug users from involvement in the criminal justice to meaningful treatment and
to divert arrested low-level offenders from prosecution to treatment. The three programs recommended for
funding are built on partnerships with community health care and substance abuse treatment resources as well
as prosecutors that link drug users with the opportunity for treatment rather than incarceration.
Program Activities
Naperville Police Department: Connect for Life is a deflection program that involves getting those struggling
with addiction the help they need. The funding will allow the department to provide individuals overcome
addiction access to area treatment providers. In addition, funding will be used continue to promote and market
the program in surrounding communities by continuing to make them aware of the program and increase
“connections.” The program serves the City of Naperville and any surrounding towns whose residents are
requesting the help of the program.
Dixon Police Department: The Safe Passage Initiative is a police deflection program designed to get heroin and
other opioid users the treatment they need. The funding will be used to train and sustain recovery coaches who
develop a coordinated system of care for individuals who voluntarily seek treatment for a substance use
disorder. The program serves Lee and Whiteside counties.
Braidwood Police Department - Communities Helping Addicts Needing to Gain Empowerment (C.H.A.N.G.E.)
is a deflection program which serves as a point of contact for individuals seeking treatment for a substance

abuse disorder. The funding will continue to help sustain a licensed social worker, who makes treatment
referrals and helps individuals avoid entry/re-entry into the criminal justice system. The program serves the City
of Braidwood, southern Will County and eastern Grundy County.
Goal
To increase public safety and reduce the large social and economic cost of narcotics use by supporting
specialized enforcement and prosecution of drug traffickers and the use of treatment over incarceration for lowlevel offenders.
Priorities
The recommended programs address the following JAG Goals/Priority for Drug Enforcement and Treatment
Programs:
To support research-informed and promising drug enforcement and treatment efforts by providing resources to
programs that break the cycle of system involvement in the criminal justice system for people who abuse legal
and illegal drugs and substances, that ensure the safety of the crime victim and the public, and that promote the
payment of restitution to crime victims and to support evidence based programs that enhance public safety and
reduce the amount of drugs and substances illegally manufactured and distributed.

Opportunity.

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1406-263: Comprehensive Law
Enforcement to Drugs: Year 2

Program Description
To combat drug trafficking, states use multijurisdictional drug task forces made up of law enforcement officers
from state, county, and local police departments to pool resources and more efficiently and effectively combat
drug distribution in multiple jurisdictions (Mazerolle, Soole, & Rombouts, 2007). Outcome evaluations reveal
multijurisdictional drug task forces are more effective at making serious drug arrests than traditional law
enforcement (Olson et al., 2002; McGarrell & Schlegel, 1993; Schlegel & McGarrell, 1991; and Myrent, 2013).
The below graph depicts drug arrests by the type of drug offense – drug possession and manufacture/delivery –
in the counties covered by the 19 MEG/TFs during 2013. MEG/TFs made proportionately more drug delivery
arrest than non-MEG/TFs in the same counties at 53 percent and 14 percent, respectively, and proportionally
fewer drug possession arrests at 44 percent and 69 percent, respectively.

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1406-263: Comprehensive Law
Enforcement Response to Drugs: Year 2

Program Description
Multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution units increase public safety and reduce the large social and economic
cost of drug use through specialized enforcement and prosecution of drug traffickers and the use of treatment
over incarceration for low-level offenders.
Program Activities
Drug prosecution units were designed to address the complexities of prosecuting drug trafficking crimes. For
example, in drug trafficking cases, the prosecution needs strong evidence proving the involvement in a single
enterprise to distribute drugs, as well as an understanding the drug trafficking organization, its day-to-day
operations, and links to organized crime and overseas suppliers (Natarajan, 2006). These drugs units work with
law enforcement officers to provide prosecutorial oversight to those cases so that the evidence will withstand
legal challenges and lead to a successful prosecution. While there is not enough research to draw conclusions on
specialized drug prosecution units, research examining other specialized prosecution units have shown these
units reduce the likelihood of case rejection (Pyrooz, Wolfe, & Spohn, 2011).
Goals
To fund state’s attorneys’ prosecution services throughout Illinois in drug-related criminal cases and in drugrelated civil asset forfeiture cases. This comes with the intention of increasing public safety and reducing the
large social and economic cost of narcotics use through specialized prosecution of drug traffickers.
Priorities
The recommended programs address the following JAG Goals/Priority for Prosecution, Court Programs, and
Indigent Defense:
Goal: To support all public prosecutors, including appellate prosecutors, by providing the resources and
training necessary to assist them in protecting public safety by holding offenders accountable while ensuring
the constitutional rights of the accused and enforcing crime victims’ constitutional and statutory rights.
