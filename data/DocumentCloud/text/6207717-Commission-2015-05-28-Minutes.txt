Quorum & Meeting Minutes
A quorum was determined to exist; however, the December meeting minutes were
unavailable to review and approve.
Administration
The commissioners were reminded that the ethics statement for the county is due May
1 and the ethics statement for the city is due May 31.
With the expiration of Marcin Siwek’s term as a commissioner, the SSA Commission is
in need of at least one new commissioner. Applicants are now being actively recruited.
A forum designed especially for new commissioners is being held at the Harold
Washington Library on Thursday, May 7. All commissioners are invited to attend.
Finances
Joy provided copies of the 2014 audit and explained the difference between this audit’s
requirement of using the government accounting model versus previous years’ nonprofit model.
Since there were no findings in the audit, Kurt motioned to accept the audit as is; John
seconded; and the motion was approved unanimously by the commissioners.
A 2014 versus 2015 Profit & Loss and Budget Statements were presented.
The draft 2016 budget is due June 12.
Garage Updates

 Three companies have provided proposals for the shot-blasting and resealing of the
garage pavement. One company has been asked to provide a detailed cost estimate of
the patching and repairing of cracks in the concrete.
The AC/heating unit still needs to be replaced in the garage office. Kurt said the
replacement unit has been identified and should be purchased from the cheapest
supplier.
New Business
The next scheduled SSA #2 Commissioners’ meeting is Wednesday, June 24.
