Item No. 3

RECOMMENDATION TO ACCEPT SUMMER YOUTH EMPLOYMENT GRANT
AWARD
Presenter:

Mary Howard, Chief Resident Services Officer

Recommendation
The Chief Executive Officer recommends that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing
Authority (“CHA”) approve the acceptance of a grant award and execution of an
Intergovernmental Agreement for a one-year base term with the Chicago Department of Family
and Support Services (“DFSS”) in the amount of $1,160,000 for the Summer Youth Employment
Program (“SYEP”).
The requested action complies in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local
laws, and Chicago Housing Authority board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due
diligence to support the submission of this initiative.
Funding
DFSS SYEP Grant Award:

$1,160,000.00

Background
SYEP is a part of the Mayor’s One Summer Chicago initiative, which brings together government
institutions, community-based organizations and companies to offer employment and internship
opportunities to youth and young adults. SYEP provides safe summer experiences while helping
youth, ages 16-24, build valuable employment skills. Participants receive on-going job readiness
instruction while working up to 180 hours over the course of six weeks; 100% of the grant funds
will be used to pay training wages to CHA youth.
CHA will be awarded funding by DFSS to build on the success of the 2018 SYEP, which served
1,829 CHA youth (52% were public housing residents and 48% were Housing Choice Voucher
participants). Last year, CHA youth participated at 367 unique worksites across the city and
worked more than 245,000 hours. CHA’s SYEP is delivered in collaboration with CHA’s contracted
FamilyWorks providers, who are responsible for being the connection between SYEP youth, the
worksite and CHA.

 Financial literacy is another key component of SYEP. CHA youth participants engage in exciting
online activities to help make the most of their summer earnings, including savings, banking,
budgeting and credit building. Youth who complete these activities earn digital badges, which are
digital credentials that provide evidence of a meaningful learning achievement.
CHA will directly manage the payroll process for SYEP participants and will provide multiple
options for youth to receive their earnings. The first option is payment via a pre-paid debit card,
which is provided at no cost to participants and allows youth to access funds at no charge from
ATMs throughout Chicago. If preferred, youth can also elect to receive their pay via direct deposit
to personal checking and savings accounts or a paper check.
Respectfully Submitted:
