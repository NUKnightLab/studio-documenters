REQUEST FOR PENSION CREDIT FOR LEASE OF ABSENCE SERVICE
Varga, Thomas

Mr. Varga did not appear at his scheduled hearing. Mr. Varga was given notice that on today's
date, pursuant to a letter dated to his attention on May 3rd, 2017, sent certified mail, that in the
event that he did not appear at the scheduled hearing time, the Board reserves the right to review
the record as submitted and render its final decision at that time. It is now five minutes after 12:00
and Mr. Varga has not appeared, nor has he requested any continuance, nor communicated in any
way with the Fund that he would not be present. So the Board has had the opportunity to look at
the record as it exists before us and the documents which Mr. Varga had submitted. Based upon
the documents submitted and review the Statutes, Board counsel advised that the request of
Officer Varga does not meet the requirements of the Illinois Pension Statutes.
After complete review of the documents submitted and pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/5-214, it was moved
by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Lappe that the Board deny Officer Varga’s request to
purchase pension credit while on a leave of absence.

Vice President Wright read into the record a Resolution in honor of departing Trustee Juan C.
Avila and tendered the inscribed version to Trustee Avila.
The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

At the last Board meeting, the Trustees discussed Mrs. Charles (Lucille) Loving. This is a widow,
who at the time of calculating her surviving spouse’s annuity, it was discovered that her deceased
husband had supplied the Fund an inaccurate birth date, which was one year earlier than his actual
date of birth. This resulted in additional cost-of-living increases throughout Mr. Loving’s retirement
for which he was not entitled. These additional payments sum to $18,000. As requested, the
Executive Director contacted Mrs. Loving and discussed the annuity overpayments with her and her
daughter and determined to $50.00 per month repayment to restore the annuity overpayment. The
Board accepts this repayment plan and a letter will be directed to Mrs. Loving confirming these
details.

Also at the last meeting, the Trustees discussed Mrs. Robert (Cynthia) Rickert, who has submitted
a request to the Board of Trustees. Her husband, a retired police officer, Robert W. Rickert passed
away March 12, 2017. He retired in 1987, and at the time of his retirement, he was single and
received a refund of his spousal contributions. He married Cynthia in 1989. Since the marriage, he
has not paid back his spousal refund to the Fund. Ms. Rickert sent a letter to the Board requesting
approval to pay the refund of the spousal contributions to the Fund now, after Robert’s death, and
thus receive a spousal annuity.
It was moved by Trustee Lappe, seconded by Trustee Hamburger that the Board deny the request of Mrs.
Cynthia (Robert) Rickert to repay the spousal refund of Robert’s pension contributions in accordance with
the provision of the Pension Act.

status with Robbins Geller as legal counsel, to be lead plaintiff in a matter against Gerdau. There

defendant.
