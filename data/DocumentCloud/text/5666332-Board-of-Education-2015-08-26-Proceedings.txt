A. Sick Day Bank? Sick days are earned by an employee at a rate of one day per full month worked and
are maintained in the employee's Sick Day Bank. Teachers who are at the maximum step of the salary
schedule and have at least thirteen (13) years of full-time teaching experience receive one (1) additional
sick day per year. Teachers who are at Step 13 on the salary schedule and have at least eighteen (18)
years of full-time teaching experience receive two (2) additional sick days per year. For new employees
hired after the start of the ?scal year, a prorated number of sick days will be maintained in their Sick Day
Bank, following a 60 calendar day waiting period that begins on the date of hire.

Effective July 1, 2012, sick days that an employee does not use on or before June 30th of the ?scal year in
which the sick days were earned shall be removed from the Sick Day Bank and forfeited. Any days in the
Sick Day Bank that an employee does not use on or before the date their employment ends shall be
forfeited. if an employee requests to use sick days before they are earned, that request may only be
granted if that employee agrees in writing that, in the event the employee resigns or is otherwise
separated from employment after having been paid unearned sick days, the CEO or designee may
deduct the amount of paid unearned sick days from any ?nal compensation due to the employee,
including any ?nal payout of vacation days on separation. 7

Nothing in this section prohibits the Chief Talent Of?cer from authorizing additional paid time?off when
appropriate in extraordinary cases where an employee's continued illness extends beyond the amount of
their available paid time off.

B. Grandfathered Sick Day Bank. For employees hired before July 1, 2012 with an existing bank of
accumulated unusad sick days as of June 30, 2012, such sick days were retained in a Grandfathered
Sick Day Bank for use by the employee. Upon resignation or retirement, unused days remaining in the
employee?s Grandfathered Sick Day Bank are subject to the payout provisions set out in Section l.H. of
this Policy. Employees with a Grandfathered Sick Day Bank who are laid off or who resign and return to
service within one year of separation shall have a restoration of their unpaid accumulated sick days in
their Grandfathered Sick Day Bank at time of separation.

transfer of other agency-sick days occurring prior to July 1, 2012, such days are maintained in an Other

authorized on an ovartime basis (but not including classes established after regular school hours to
supplement the regular program, such as after-school classes in reading and arithmetic, driver training
programs, evening school programs and social center programs), will be entitled to extended?day pay
when absent if entitled to sick pay for the nonnai school day under the provisions of this policy.

E. Physician?s Certi?cate. Any employee who is absent for more than three (3) consecutive work days
shall provide a certi?cate of treatment from a physician, or if the treatment is by prayer or spiritual means,
from the advisor or practitioner of such employee's faith as condition .of his/her retum to work. If a
supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that an employee is abusing sick days, slhe may demand that the
employee provide a certi?cate that the employee has received treatment from a physician, advisor or
practitioner regardless of the number of days of absence.

F. Retumees from Military Leave. Employees who return from military leaves within sixty (60) days after
they are honorably discharged shall receive credit for the purpose of sick day allotment for the period of
