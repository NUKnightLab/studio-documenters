RE: Fiscal Review of the Proposed Capital Agenda FY 2020 through 2024

The Administration has presented to the City Council for their review and approval a proposed Five Year
Capital Agenda for the ?scal years 2020 through 2024.

This document?s submission to Council is to comply with the Detroit City Charter, section 8-202, ?Capital
Agenda?, that states that on or before November 1 in each even numbered year, the mayor shall submit a
proposed capital agenda for the next ?ve ?scal years to the City Council. All of the charter-outlined tasks
and review of the capital agenda must be completed and authorized by March 1 of the following year. If
Council fails to act by March 1, the capital agenda as proposed shall be deemed approved. Attached to this
report is a copy of the charter language. See Attachment 1.

This proposed Capital Agenda is far more robust in many respects than the prior capital agenda. Once
again the Capital Agenda does include the detail of many capital improvements in the city made through
the Development Financing Programs that fall under the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation. Also back
in the document are the many functions and assets along with their capital accomplishments and plans, that
in the past ?ve years, have been spun off through state legislation and authority creation such as Coho Hall
DIA, Eastern Market the Historical Museum and the Zoo. While the City In most cases, continues to own
the assets. they are managed by other entities through either contracts. memorandums of understanding or
legislation. There IS much more information provided about completed projects budget for the.L
current year, out-year projects as well as necessary projects that currently have no funding.

Additionally in the Capital Agenda document. under the Appendices section are both the Strategic Plan for
TranSpoitation and the Strategic Neighborhood Fund 2.0 documents which outline the rebuilding of

neighborhoods and the strengthening of the public transportation system. Also included are maps of
planned capital improvements for the Fire facilities and Recreation facilities throughout the city.

The Government Finance Of?cers Association (GFOA) has approved best practices for the mult-year
capital planning process which are attached to this document for your review. See Attachment 2.

Breakdown of Proposed Fundinu Sources

The recommended capital planning program totals $1.81 billion, which also includes the current ?scal year.
This is an increase of 30% over the last approved ?ve-year Capital Agenda (March 2017), which totaled
$1.39 billion.

Of the $1.81 billion that is recommended in the ?ve?year plan, $520.0 million is anticipated to come from
the recently authorized unlimited general obligation (GO) bonds, the prior unused GO bonds, the City?s
general fund free balance, the remaining bankruptcy exit ?nancing funds, and philanthropic and private
investment funds. Outstanding G.O. bond funds currently total $49 million. Please see detail in table
below.

This proposed Capital Agenda plans that the remaining 70% of the fund sources for the proposed capital
projects DWSD Bonds, Federal Grants and State Formula Funds - will be accessible at the necessary
time. Federal and State legislation as well as the bond markets could potentially alter these plans, plus
$557 million of the proposed budget is tied to GLWA selling revenue bonds for projects at DWSD. See
Attachments 3 6, which are ?nancing charts from the proposed Capital Agenda.

Capital Agenda as a Planning Tool

It is important to review this Capital Agenda in the proper context. It is a planning document prepared
every 2 years for a ?ve-year timeframe. The stated project prioritization can shift at any point in time as it
often has in past cycles. Once Council authorizes the Agenda, the city still has no legal authority to carry
out any of the projects. Requests for funding as well as contracts for the particular project work would still
have to come before Council for authorization.

There are no secured appropriations as a consequence of approval of this document. Appropriations must
?rst be budgeted and authorized in the annual budget process and then an actual contract and speci?c
?nancing plan has to be secured and brought before Council for authorization.

Concluding Remarks and Questions for the Administration

The amount of annual funding received through state and federal grants is what truly shapes the projects of
the city?s capital agenda. When reviewing the funding sources, 70% of the capital dollars are grant dollars
and revenue bonds.

We would ask that the Administration provide written responses to the following questions -

. It appears that the Public Lighting Authority?s (PLA) bond balance has been depleted. What is the
recognized cycle for capital upgrades for the current system. What is the plan for expansion? How are
the operation and maintenance costs covered?

. Please provide Council with documentation that highlights language between GLWA and DWSD that
GLWA will issue revenue bonds for DWSD.

. Is the DWSD no longer receiving federal grants?

. What projects remain outstanding from the exit ?nancing funds? Please explain the parameters for
expending it.

. Why was only $15 million of the prior bond sale balance used over the last two years?
. Please provide a listing of the various Philanthropic funds noted of $34 million.

. Please explain the Private Investment funds of $16 million and how they are part of capital
improvement.

. Please explain the difference between General Fund Balance/ Surplus and Other City Funds.

. Why is the CDBG/Home/Section 108 projected to drop by $38 million?

EEST PRACTICE

Capital Planning Policies

BACKGROUND:

Policies designed to guide capital planning help to assue that unique needs are
filly considered in the capital plant-ting process. Effective policies can also help a government to
assue the sustairabitlty of Its infrastructure by establishing a process lor addressing maintenance.
replacement. and proper fixed asset over the fut life of capital assets. In addition.
capital planning policies can strengthen a governnents borrowing position by demonstrating sou'td
fiscal management and showing the lurlsdictions commitment to maximizing benefit to the public
within Its resource constraints.

Good capital piercing policies can lead to the development of a capital plan that is coralstent with
best practices: however. they do not constitute the capital plan itself. Rather. capital planing
policies establish a framework in which stakeholders understand their roles. responsibilities. and
expectations for the process and an and resdt.? ideally. such policies also Include gdde?nes for
coordiratlng capital projects and promoting scmd. long-term operational and capital finanolrg
strategies.

To create a sustainable capital plan. the finance officer and other participants in the capital planning
process need to consider at capital needs as a whole. assess fiscal capacity. plan for debt
lectures. and understand impact on reserves and operating budgets. all within a given planning
tirneframe Capital planing policies provide an essential framework for managing these tasks and
for assuring that capital plate are consistent with overall organizational goals

RECOMMENDATION:

GFOA recommends that governments develop and adopt capital plan-ting policies that take Into
their unique organizational characteristics lrcludlng the services they provide. how they are
struttued. and their external environment.

Capital policies shole provide. at minimum

1. A description of how an organization will approach capital planning. how
stakeholder departments will collaborate to prepare a plan flat best meets the operational
and ?nancial needs of the organization

2. A clear definition of what constitutes a capital improvement project 3

3. Establishment of a capital improvement program review committee and identi?cation of
members (for example. the finance officer or budget oi?cer. representatives lrom piartning.
engineering. and project managemera. and. as deemed appropriate. operations departments
most affected by capital plans. along with a description of the of the
comrrittee and Its members.

4. A description of the role of the ptbilc and other external stakeholders In the process (The
level and type of plastic participation should be consistent with commur'ity expectations and
past experiences.)

5. identi?cation of how decisions will be made In the capital planning process including a
structued process for priorititng need and allocating limited resouces

6. A restatement that the plenring process includes an assessment of the governments fiscal
capacity so that the final capital plan is based on what can realistically be funded by the
government rather than being simply a wish list of unfunded needs.

7. A procedure for acmdating necessary capital reserves lor both new and replacement
pact-uses.

B. A policy for linking strategies with usefti life of the asset including identifying when
debt can be Issued and any restrictions on the length of debt.3

9. A reqdrement that a mail-year capital improvement plan be developed and flat it include
long temt llnancing considerations and strategies.

to. A process for funding to ensure tint capital protect funding Is consistent with legal

For Council?s review, the attached schedules present the gaming tax revenue activity through
October 2018 and prior ?scal years.

Through the fourth month of the ?scal year the casinos reported a combined gross gaming
receipts increase of 3.11% compared to the same period in the prior ?scal year. Broken out by
casino, gross receipts are up by 3.86%, Motor City?s are up by 1.38% and Greektown?s
are up by 4.26%, compared with the ?rst third of the prior ?scal year.

In the fourth month of the ?scal year, the City collected $18.38 million in gaming tax revenue,
which was 2.69 greater than October 2017, as re?ected in Chart 1. Chart 2 Detroit
Gaming Tax Collections? through a twelve-month moving average trend line shows an increase
of 1.95% since last October among the combined casino tax revenues. Based on existing data,
there is projected to be surplus of $3.16 million for the ?scal year for a gaming revenue total of
$183.9 million, a 2.77% increase over last year.

Adjusted gross casino gaming receipts were reported at $115.95 million for the month of
October 2018 as shown in Chart 1A. This represented a 2.92% gain compared with October
2017. Chart 2A Detroit Gaming Receipts? through a twelve-month moving average

trend line shows growth of 1.93% among the combined casino receiptsMGM and Motor City are each paying 12.9% of gross gaming receipts to the City, while
Greektown Casino is paying 11.9% of gross gaming receipts and is broken out as follows. By
state law, all casinos are now paying 10.9% of gross gaming receipts to the City as wagering tax.
The casinos also have an additional 1% payment because of the 2002 amended development
agreement with the City. Additionally, if a casino reaches $400 million in receipts in a calendar
year, like MGM and Motor City, then an additional 1% is paid to the City per the amended
development agreement of 2002.

There is not a complete one-to-one relationship between the adjusted gross receipts and the tax
revenue collection increases when comparing prior years, due to two factors. First, there is the
fact that MGM and Motor City casinos began paying the City 1% less due to the permanent
casinos opening on October 3 and November 29 of 2007. This reduction to the City is part of
state Public Act 306 of 2004, when the legislature amended Public Act 69 of 1997, which was
the original casino gaming legislation. PA. 306 increased the wagering tax by 6% of which 2%
went to the City of Detroit. PA. 306 also allowed that when the permanent casino had been
certi?ed by the state gaming board as having operated for 30 consecutive days and once the City
determined the project was complete, 5% of the 6% additional wagering tax would be
eliminated, with the remaining 1% allocated to the City where the casino is being operated.
Greektown continued to pay the 6% additional wagering tax 4% to the state, 2% to the City 
until its permanent status was agreed to by the Administration and approved by the State Gaming
Commission, which occurred on March 9, 2010.

Second, the amended development of August 2002 between the City and the casinos,
which is separate from the state law, has all casinos, beginning in January 2006, paying an
additional 1% over the state law, plus another 1% when the casino reaches $400 million in gross
receipts in a calendar year. For the thirteenth year, MGM and Motor City are projected to
exceed $400 million in the calendar year and increase gaming tax collections by $10.6 million
between September and December. MGM reached $400 million in August a month earlier than
prior years and Motor City reached $400 million in October similar to last year.

TO: Detroit City Council
FROM: David Whitaker, Director 
Legislative Policy Division Staff
DATE: December 20, 2018
RE: Summary of the Detroit Land Bank Authority First Quarter FY 2019

The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) has been requested by Council Member James Tate to
provide a summary review on the Detroit Land Bank Authority?s Quarterly Report submitted to
City Council, October 15, 2018.

The Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) submits a quarterly report to the City Council which
provides an overview of the activity of the entity. The report primarily breaks down the various
divisions of the DLBA which include the Finance Department, Inventory Department,
Disposition Department, Demolition Department, Legal Department and Community Affairs
Department. LPD is providing a summary which attempts to re?ect the most pertinent issues or
new information that is derived from within the quarterly report.

Finance Department

The Finance Department conducted a ?nancial overview of the entity?s ?nancial status.
The DLBA indicates in the unaudited actual YTD (year-to-date) versus the budget YTD for the
?rst quarter of ?scal year 2019. The total government revenue actually received from Michigan
State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) was $15,804,929 compared to the budgeted
government revenue from the source of $14,160,560 a variance of $1,644,369. With regard to
revenues provided to the DLBA from the City of Detroit (City) unaudited actual YTD (year?to-
date) versus the budget YTD for the ?rst quarter 2019, the actual received by the DLBA from the
city is $3,778,200 compared to the budgeted amount of $3,500,000. A variance of $278,200
which was received from COD Blight dollars. The DLBA report does not address the manner in
which the $278,200 was appropriated. City Council may wish to con?rm with the DLBA and the
Mayor?s Administration on whether the COD Blight dollar appropriation was properly submitted

for approval by City Council, as LPD ?nds no record or electronic transmittal to City Council for
this amount.1

Inventory Department

The Inventory Department manages the acquisition, data management, property
management, client services, title management, and coordination of DLBA properties with other
public partners. In the July 2018 Quarterly Report the DLBA indicated that the inventory of
property was 95,252 throughout the city of Detroit, in this ?rst quarterly report of FY 2019, the
current inventory is reported as 94,562, a reduction of 690 parcels. Based on the information
provided the reduction was from the sale of vacant lots and the sale of parcels with residential
structures.2 It is reported that since January 2014, the DLBA has sold more than 14,881 parcels
properties to date.

The DLBA property inventory is assessed and designated to a particular program in the entity?s
pipeline. The DLBA reports that it recently inspected over 11,700 parcels in its inventory.
Included in this inspection was 6,936 parcels that are outside the Hardest Hit Fund (HHF)
designated areas.3 The inspections conducted were part of the regular review to capture
updated property conditions and occupancy information and to determine whether a structure
should be placed in the demolition or sale for rehab pipelines.

Disposition Department

The Disposition Department is responsible for the sale or relinquishing title of the
properties in the entity?s possession. This is done through a number of programs set up at the
DLBA.

I Side Lot Sales Program: In September 2018, the DLBA sold 48 side lots in District 2.

0 Auction: In the period of July September 2018, the DLBA sold 214 properties through
the auction.

0 Own it Now Program: In the period of July September 2018, the DLBA sold 222
properties under the program.

0 Rehabbed and Ready: In the period of July September 2018, the DLBA sold 2 under
the program.

I Occupied Buy Back Program: During the period of July September 2018, the DLBA
closed on 60 properties under the program.

 

LPD notes that the revenue identi?ed was not budgeted and listed as ?Actual LPD was unable to identify

the appropriation and the approval by City Council.
2 LPD 690 parcel reduction in inventory appear to be a combination of residential sales and/or vacant lot sales under

the various DLBA programs.
3 The DLBA currently has 28,111 parcels residential structures of which 17,179 are in the HHF areas and 10,932 are

in non-HHF areas.

a Community Partnership Program: The report identi?es recent Community Partnership
sales as being 23 lots and 4 structures.

Demolition Department

As previously reported by the DLBA, credits were issued from MSHDA representing a refund of
settlement proceeds as well as the return of the Fire Insurance Escrow dollars paid to MSHDA.
The current refund of $6,602,690.52 is to be used to demolish additional residential structures.
The refunds were issued as follows: HHFI $5,409,638.69; HHF2 $1,192,413.56; HHF3 $638.25.
As of the date of this report, all ?ve rounds of HHF funding are currently open and the DLBA
has identi?ed properties from the HHF areas to apply the respective refunds. The DLBA
indicates it has demolished 9,948 residential structures under the ?rst four HHF rounds as of the
date of the quarterly report. The DLBA further anticipates an additional 500 residential structures
to be demolished under HHF round 4 proceeds.

The Department is currently in the ?fth round of HHF distribution. This round of funding is to
provide $88,153,425 in demolition funds. As of September 30, 2018, the DLBA (in conjunction
with the Detroit Building Authority/ DBA) has issued demolition and abatement contracts for
4,000 properties. As of the date of the quarterly report the DLBA has been reimbursed
$1,855,158.77; leaving $86,298,266.23 in grant ?lnds to be drawn down, which is inclusive of
the $4,448,375.86 for which the DLBA is seeking reimbursement.

In April 2018, the DLBA issued an RF for Procurement Administrative Services to transition
the HHF procurement process to a third-party company skilled at providing such services on the
scale and scope the DLBA envisioned. Effective July 1, 2018, the DLBA transitioned all of its
HHF procurement services from the DBA to Price, Waterhouse, Coopers, Public Sector, LLP
(PWC). The DLBA indicates that since the transition to PWC there has been a sharp increase in
overall ef?ciency and notes that the time to review, tabulate, and award has dropped from
six-to-eight weeks to two weeks. The DLBA expected to eliminate its RFP backlog by the
middle of October 2018.

The DLBA also notes that in complying with the revised blight manual implemented by
MSHDA prohibiting the use of local preferences in contract bid awards, the contractor pre-
quali?cation program continued to maintain its current list of thirteen pre?quali?ed demolition
contractors of which three are minority business enterprises (MBE) or women business
enterprises (WBE). In addition there are four additional demolition contractors seeking pre?
quali?ed status which are under review.

Legal Department

The Legal Department provides legal counsel and assistance to the DLBA Board,
Executive Director and to the organization?s staff for all the various programs. In addition, the
Legal Department staffs programs under its purview:

0 Quiet Title: As of September 30, 2018, the Legal Department has received 72
quiet title judgments for the quarter and 483 in total.

4?1

- Nuisance Abatement/Abandoned Properties: In this quarter, as of September 30,
2018, the Legal Department obtained over 112 agreements with property owners
to rehab their properties, 16 default judgments, 5 property donations and 6
properties purchased through ?We Buy It?.

0 Compliance: The Compliance Team enforces agreements signed by
property owners who have either purchase property from the DLBA (Sales
Compliance for properties obtained by auction, Own it Now or Community
Partners) or, whose property was subject to the Legal Department?s nuisance
abatement action. The overall DLBA monitoring of compliance regarding is as

 

follows:
Compliance Program: Total 2018 Quarter Ending 6/3 0/ 1 8
Currently monitored 2,672 1321 475
Compliance Achieved 2,537 497 189
Failed Compliance 771 252 77

Community Affairs Department

The Community Affairs Department handles community outreach, public meetings, open houses,
off site sales events and social media communications as part of its community engagement
program. In September the DLBA secured positive media coverage from local and national
media outlets featuring accomplishments of the DLBA. Increased its community engagement
and outreach by interacting with Detroiters face to face hosting information tables, meeting with
faith-based organizations; and holding weekly of?ce hours in council districts. The DLBA has
engaged in social media utilizing Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for community
outreach in addition to its paid marketing.
