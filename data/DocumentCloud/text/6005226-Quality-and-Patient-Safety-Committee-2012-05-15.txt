IV.

Report from System Interim Chief Nursing Officer
A. Nurse Staffing Dashboard
Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief Nursing Officer, provided an update on the subject of bed closures in the
nursing units at Stroger Hospital. As reported at the April Committee Meeting, of the twenty-eight (28) beds
that had been closed in order to provide safe staffing levels since December, sixteen (16) beds had been
reopened. She stated that management is working towards having the twelve (12) remaining beds re-opened by
June 11th. Current plans call for six (6) of the twelve (12) beds to be re-opened by June 1st; the remaining six
(6) beds are planned to be re-opened by June 11th.

IV.

Report from System Interim Chief Nursing Officer (continued)
With regard to the efforts toward the development of a dashboard for nurse staffing and nursing hours
standards, Ms. Russell stated that the key indicators have been identified; these indicators include the hours per
patient day, vacancy rate and turnover rate. She noted that a benchmark of 50th percentile has been identified
for nurse staffing; she added that budgeted positions are approximately at the 25th percentile.
Ms. Russell stated that data on hours per patient day is reported quarterly, and is not captured on a month-tomonth basis at this time; she noted that data on vacancy and turnover rates will be reviewed on monthly basis.
Chairman Ansell responded that this report could be presented to the Committee on a quarterly basis.
With regard to the information presented on the benchmarks for nurse staffing, Ms. Russell stated that currently,
because the units are not fully staffed, the 25th percentile benchmark has not yet been reached. The goal for the
basic Medical-Surgical unit for the 50th percentile would be 9.64 hours per patient day; it is currently at 7.71
hours per patient day. With regard to the number of current vacancies, in the Medical-Surgical unit there is a
32% vacancy rate (153 vacancies in March 2012, which does not include new hires, of the budgeted 484
budgeted positions). Chairman Ansell stated that it would be worthwhile to be able to track and trend how well
the System is doing on this metric.

V.

Report from System Director of Quality and Patient Safety
A. Quarterly System Quality and Safety Dashboard (Attachment #1)
Barbara Farrell, System Director of Quality and Patient Safety, presented the Quarterly System Quality and
Safety Dashboard. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
B. Reports on the following subjects:
i. Quality report from the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County (Attachment #2)
Dr. David Barker, Chief Medical Officer of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center, presented the quality
report. Included in his presentation was information on the following subjects: Access Dashboard; Routine
HIV Testing; Retention in Care Projects; and CORE Quality Assurance Plan. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
During the presentation of the report, the subject of dental services was discussed. Chairman Ansell noted
that the System recently entered into a contract with CommunityHealth for the provision of dental services;
he inquired as to whether there were plans to bring the provision of dental services in-house.
Dr. Mason stated that there were two dental funding sources. The first $1 million that was budgeted was for
the provision of dental services as referred to by Chairman Ansell, where the System is augmenting service
offering at CommunityHealth’s Englewood clinic, by providing a refurbished suite for the operatories that
were present there; he added that management is also looking at some planning in the other areas. The
second grant was to look at how the System can do this on an internal basis, because the original grant was
not clear on whether this funding would be recurring. Once it was clear that it was planned to be a recurring
funding, management moved to go ahead and think about using those dollars for internal resources at two of
the southern suburban clinics, and in one in the west side area. Now that it appears that there will be stable
funding for this, at least for the foreseeable future, the plan is to move in that direction. A position for a
System dental officer, who would be in charge of monitoring dental services across the System, has been
posted; it is expected that candidates for that position will soon be reviewed.

information on an issue regarding medical abbreviations used among different disciplines that appear as the
