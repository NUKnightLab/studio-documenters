Commissioner.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
OPPOSING ADDITIONAL LOCAL POLICE DUTIES

WHEREAS, law enforcement and the maintenance of law and order is one of the
most important duties of government and is paramount in a civilized society; and

WHEREAS, public safety is enhanced by different levels of government recognizing
their responsibility in a system of different responsibilities among such
governments, while working together on maintaining the quality of life; and

WHEREAS, local police departments are the foundation of public safety, whereby
such officers are the closest to the people, with a better understanding of the
residents and community in which they serve; and

WHEREAS, the County Sheriffs Office plays an important role in working with such
local police jurisdictions, augmenting their services through regional law
enforcement programs and initiatives, and by providing resources and facilities that
individual police departments may be unable to provide; and

WHEREAS, budgetary constraints have compelled the Cook County Sheriff?s
Police Department to become the primary law enforcement agency in Ford Heights,
a south suburban community in Cook County; and

WHEREAS, various other suburban communities experiencing budgetary
constraints are now considering eliminating their local police departments in order
to save funds, thereafter relying on the Sheriff's Police Department to assume
primary police authority and duties in their municipalities; and

WHEREAS, the County Sheriff?s Police Department is not staffed or equipped to
assume such duties in additional municipalities.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of
Commissioners of Cook County oppose the expansion of primary police authority
and duties to additional municipal jurisdictions; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Sheriff?s Office is advised that no additional

resources will be provided to expand such authority and duties; except where
Board approval provides for funding through contract policino. and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the State?s Attorney?s Office is directed to

review and concur with any such contract
policing intergovernmental agreement police contract and issue a recommendation
to the Board prior to consideration of such agreement bv the Board,
