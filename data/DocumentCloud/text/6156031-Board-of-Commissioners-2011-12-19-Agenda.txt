requesting authorization for approval and execution of Contract No. 11-53-164 with Imperial Parking

bidder. The cost savings for this project are $341,741.88

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $2,024,754.12 ($674,918.04 per year). Contract period: Thirty-six (36) months
from the date of execution. (499-260 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014 funds.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
