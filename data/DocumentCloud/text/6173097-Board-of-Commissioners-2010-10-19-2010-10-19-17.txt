GENERAL BACKGROUND
The CHA’s current contracts for employee healthcare plan benefits with HUMANA (medical
and dental), Davis Vision, and Lincoln Financial (Life, STD and LTD) will terminate on
December 31, 2010 and must be replaced effective January 1, 2011. The U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) has previously authorized the CHA to utilize its
insurance Broker of Record to solicit competitive insurance bids on behalf of the CHA.

 In 2009, participants of the CHA’s Healthcare received a 53% increase of current employee
contributions. Currently participants of CHA’s Healthcare pay an average of 20% of the total
health care costs (e.g., premiums, deductibles, co-payments). Health insurance premiums have
consistently grown faster than inflation in recent years. Between 2004 and 2009, the cumulative
growth in health insurance premiums was 82%, compared with cumulative inflation of 17% and
cumulative wage growth of 19%.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA’s insurance broker for Employee Health Plan Benefits, Mesirow Financial
(“Mesirow”), directly solicited requests for insurance premium quotes from 36 top healthcare
insurance providers in their respective fields for employee medical, dental, vision, Life, STD and
LTD insurance, including the CHA’s current healthcare benefit insurance providers. Letters
requesting premium quotes, along with current data (April 2010 CHA census population)
necessary for preparing insurance premium quotes, were delivered by Mesirow to the 36
healthcare insurance providers on June 1, 2010 requesting submittal of proposals by August 2,
2010. The estimated 2011 renewal “not-to-exceed amounts” stated above are estimated from
eligible staff headcount of projected participant levels for 2011.
Mesirow received 1 proposed quote for medical, 3 for dental, 4 for vision and 4 for Life, LTD
and STD benefits and 4 for flexible spending accounts. The recommended awarded vendor for
medical insurance, Humana Healthcare, provided a proposal of 4.59% over the 2010 rates for
2011. The national trend for rate increases in employee medical insurance premiums, as reported
by the AON Spring 2010 Health Care Trend Survey, is projected to exceed 10-16% for the year
2011. Humana Healthcare provides a comprehensive and extensive medical PPO and HMO
hospital and physician network for CHA. Humana dental offered an estimated rate 3.87% over
the current rates. Although the 2 alternate dental carriers offered a proposal less than CHA’s
2010 rates, Humana dental nationally is in the top 3 largest dental networks, and they offer
additional value in their dental PPO and HMO plans. Davis Vision’s quote was extremely
favorable to the CHA with a decrease of 2% in premiums and the overall employee satisfaction
has been favorable over the years. Davis vision is partnered with the largest eyecare network
provider, used by a large volume of current employees, Vision Works, and with a newly offered
enhanced benefit for the 2011 plan year Davis Vision is the best choice for CHA. Compared to
the other insurers that provided competitive quotes for dental and vision, Humana Healthcare,
Humana Dental and the Davis Vision’s plans offered a better overall value to the CHA and its
eligible participants.
For Life, STD and LTD insurance, AUL-One America Life offered the most competitive rates
with approximate savings of $78,000 (32%) from Lincoln Financial 2010 rates. However, based
on the condition of employees not actively at work and receiving benefits, AUL and the other
carriers cannot guarantee coverage of those individuals as a new carrier.

 The not-to-exceed amounts for each contract reflect the total premiums that include CHA’s
eligible participants and the eligible participants of CHA’s Affiliates. The CHA’s affiliates will
reimburse the CHA 100% of the premiums (approximately $500,000) to cover the above
referenced Employee Health Benefit Plans for their eligible participants during the term of these
contracts.
Based upon the above considerations and the recommendation of the CHA’s management, it is in
the best interest of the CHA to enter into contracts for the CHA’s Employee Health Benefit Plans
for the period of January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 with options to extend the contracts for
one additional one-year term for the FY2012 option benefit year with the following providers:
(1) Humana HealthCare (medical) in an amount not-to-exceed $5,304,951.00 for the base term
and subject to funding availability, an amount not-to-exceed $5,600,000.00 for the option year;
(2) Humana, (dental) in an amount not-to-exceed $238,576.44 for the base term and subject to
funding availability, an amount not-to-exceed $238,576.44 for the option year; (3) Davis Vision
in an amount not-to-exceed $40,010.93 for the base term and subject to funding availability, an
amount not-to-exceed $40,010.93 for the option year; (4) Lincoln National Life [Life, Short-term
disability (STD) and Long-term disability (LTD)] in an amount not-to-exceed $287,270.71 for
the base term and subject to funding availability, an amount not-to-exceed $287,270.71 for the
option year; and (5) Ameriflex for employee flexible spending accounts in an amount not-toexceed $11,825.00 for the base term, and subject to funding availability, an amount not-toexceed $11,825.00 for the option year. The aggregate amount of all insurance coverage is notto-exceed $5,882,634.08 for FY2011 and subject to funding availability, an aggregate amount
not-to-exceed $6,177,683.08 the FY2012 benefit year option term.
