In light of this significant investment, the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, in conjunction with
Openlands and the Chicago District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, have the common goal to
provide for the ongoing stewardship, restoration, maintenance and management needed to sustain and
build upon the successful restoration efforts undertaken during the initial enhancement project.
To that end, this agreement provides for continued management at the Tinley Creek Wetlands OMMA
site over the course of the next five (5) years, boosting the long term sustainability and success of the
restoration already completed at the site. The value of work to be provided by Openlands under the
proposed contract is estimated by Openlands not to exceed $890,000.00.
A motion was made by Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Steele, that this Contract be
approved. The motion carried by the following vote:

REPORT
Department: Resource Management
Request: Receive and File
Report Title: Tree Mitigation Plan
Report Period: N/A
Summary: The Board of Commissioners approved the Forest Preserve District of Cook County’s (the
“Preserves”) Tree Mitigation Plan on 3/21/2007. The Tree Mitigation Plan is utilized as a tool to determine
the value of trees that are lost due to license and easement requests affecting Forest Preserve
property.
The valuation formula is driven by a dollar amount for the cross sectional area of the tree in
square
inches. The current standardized value of $71/sq2 was set by the Illinois Chapter of the International
Society of Arboriculture for the northern section of Illinois, and has not been updated since
2007.
In response to changing markets over the last near decade, it is recommended that the cross-sectional cost
per square inch be amended to a valuation more consistent with today’s rates. An industry-recognized
method is to utilize the average cost of similarly priced trees procured through the Preserves’ existing
tree planting contracts to extrapolate per square inch costs. Using this method, the new value comes out to
$107.54/sq2.
It is recommended that the Tree Mitigation Plan be updated to reflect this new value, with the option to
amend this value on an annual basis according to changes in the Consumer Price Index.
A motion was made by Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Steele, that this Report be
referred to the Finance Committee. The motion carried by the following vote:
Ayes:
