Meeting Minutes - Final

February 13, 2019

William M. Wolfson, Chief Administrative and Compliance Officer, stated that
at the January 23, 2019 Board of Directors Meeting, there was discussion
amongst the Board Members regarding a proposed contract between the
GLWA and Oakland-Macomb Interceptor Drain Drainage District and whether
it would go directly to the full Board or to multiple (GLWA) Committees, and
Mr. Wolfson wanted to revisit that with the Board.
At the end of the (January 23, 2019) discussion, the referrals were to Legal
Committee (Members Hendrix and Munfakh), Capital Planning Committee
(Members Munfakh, Daddow, and Hupy), Operations and Resources
Committee (Members Baker, Hendrix and Hupy), and then a discussion at the
full Board, which would mean that certain Board Members would see this
matter three or four times. Recognizing that this is an important issue, Mr.
Wolfson wanted to know if that is still the way the Board wishes to proceed,
or would the Board consider having the discussions on this issue go to the
entire Board and have them at the full Board level?
That being said, the Board's decision was to have the discussions at the full
Board level.

12. Adjournment
Chairman Baker requested a Motion to Adjourn.
Motion By: Gary Brown
Support By: Freman Hendrix
Action: Approved
The motion carried by a unanimous vote.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 3:46 p.m.
