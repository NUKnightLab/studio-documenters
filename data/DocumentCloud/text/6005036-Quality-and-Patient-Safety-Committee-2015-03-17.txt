Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, Chief Quality Officer, provided a brief update on regulatory and accreditation matters. She
reminded the Committee that Prieto Clinic is in the window for The Joint Commission’s (TJC) single site visit to
accredit it as a Primary Care Medical Home. Stroger Hospital is also in the window for its next full accreditation
survey by TJC that should occur anytime between now and November.
B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das noted that staff have recently experienced a lot of technical issues with data collection; she had hoped to
have the January data for this meeting, but was unable to include it due to those issues. She believes the issues
are temporary. Data abstractions are both manual and computer-assisted, and come through the Cerner System.
Cerner produces upgrades, as any electronic medical record (EMR) system does. Staff believes that the
Lighthouse application is perhaps not as stable as it could be, because with each upgrade, a temporary setback
sometimes occurs; it takes a few weeks to realign the version of one application to the other. Under normal
circumstances, Dr. Das stated that there should be a lag of approximately six (6) weeks between when the data
is received and when it is presented to the Committee.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
B. Metrics (continued)
With regard to slide 5, Board Chairman Hammock noted that it is hard to ascertain progress, as no targets are set
for these measures. Dr. Das stated that the way people usually set these indicators is by a percentage reduction
over the baseline; following discussion, it was determined that Dr. Das would work on the best way to set
targets for the measures.
During the discussion of the information on slide 5 regarding pressure ulcers, Dr. Das noted that, later in the
year, a more in-depth presentation is planned regarding ulcers and falls, which are both nursing-sensitive
indicators; that presentation is expected to provide unit-specific data.
It was noted that slide 6 contained an error; the variance under the Board Metrics section for Overall Rating of
Hospital should be 24%, not 10%.
With regard to slide 7, Board Chairman Hammock stated that it would be helpful if the slide header would
include the word “Ambulatory” with the description of ACHN. Additionally, it would be helpful in the targets
if it was footnoted somehow where there are national targets or percentiles.
Director Marsh stated that it would also be helpful to have an overall average for the previous six or twelve
months, perhaps placed right before the target, particularly for the core measures and efficiencies.
The Committee discussed the data on the measures relating to efficiency in the Operating Rooms (OR) at
Stroger Hospital on slide 2. Director Marsh noted that, based on the data, it appears that the OR is not doing as
many cases as it should be doing. Dr. Marsh requested that the Committee receive an update on this subject
within the next few months as to what the drivers are, and the number of cases that were not able to be done in a
given day. Dr. Das responded affirmatively.
Director Lerner inquired whether there is there a process improvement team involved in the OR turnaround time
issue. Dr. Das responded affirmatively. Mr. Daniels stated that a project team for that purpose is assembled and
in place; it is composed of a subset of individuals from the OR Committee. Director Lerner suggested that the
Committee have a drill-down at one of its upcoming meetings so the members can try to identify the obstacles
to achieving the targets. Dr. Das noted that a drill-down on the subject is planned in the schedule for later this
year1.

C. Assessment of Language and Literacy (Attachment #2)
Dr. Das provided an overview of the presentation on the Assessment of Language and Literacy. The following
individuals provided additional information on the subject: Debra Carey, Chief Operating Officer of
Ambulatory Services; Dr. John O’Brien, Director of Professional Education; and Jack Daley, Director of
Support Services. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the subject of staffing clinics with bilingual staff and assessments of primary patient
populations that will be served, Board Chairman Hammock stated that, in the System’s challenge to retain its
CountyCare patients and patients in general, at a later date it would be helpful to see how the staffing lines up
against the patients served. Ms. Carey responded that this information can be provided.

III.

Report from Chief Quality Officer
C. Assessment of Language and Literacy (continued)
During the discussion of the use of telephone interpreters, Dr. O’Brien stated that the cost of using telephone
interpreters is $.85 per minute. If a provider needs a Spanish or Polish interpreter, which are services provided
by in-house interpreters, they are asked to press one of the buttons and that takes them to the in-house
interpreters; if nobody answers the call, it is then forwarded to the telephone interpreters. A request was made
for information on the total cost for telephonic interpreters for outpatient services2; Mr. Daniels responded that
he will provide that information.
Director Lerner inquired whether this data is inclusive of CountyCare patients. Dr. Das responded that the data
is by site of care; she believes that she can assemble it by insurance status. Director Lerner stated that it might
be helpful to reflect the crossover between quality and patient safety and managed care3; he asked Dr. Das to
connect with Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, to further discuss the matter. He stated that,
clearly, one of the ways to keep people in a managed care environment is to make sure the organization is
communicating with them, so it would be helpful to have that information.

IV.

Action Items
A. Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, February 17, 2015
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Marsh, moved to accept the Minutes of the Quality
and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of February 17, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

B. **Medical Staff Appointments/Re-appointments/Changes (Attachment #3)
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Marsh, moved to approve the Medical Staff
Appointments/Reappointments/Changes. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Any items listed under Sections IV, V and VI

V.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Aaron Hamb, of Provident Hospital of Cook County, indicated that Dr. Anwer Hussain, President of the
Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of Cook County, was not in attendance, and did not
have a report to present at this time.
Dr. Ozuru Ukoha, President of the EMS of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, presented his
report. Their monthly meeting was held last week. At the meeting, Dr. Claudia Fegan, Executive Medical
Director brought two items to their attention that she would like to be taken more seriously. One relates to
patient identification - she requested the medical staff to require two identifiers for every patient encounter;
preferably these would be the patient’s name and date of birth. The other item relates to procedures; there
needs to be a proper way of documenting clinicians’ certifications that leads to privileges.

testimony on a complaint lodged against an employee of the public body or against
legal counsel for the public body to determine its validity,” 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(11),
regarding “litigation, when an action against, affecting or on behalf of the particular
body has been filed and is pending before a court or administrative tribunal, or when
