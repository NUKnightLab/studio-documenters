RECYCLING PLAN:

DDP requires all food trucks in our Downtown Street Eats program to use recyclable compostable/
biodegradable packaging. Forthose without resources or with limited resources, DDP has arranged a
packaging partner, Michigan Green Safe Products, who will offer advice for optimizing bulk costs. We will
offer a tiered Green Food Truck Certification for compliant food trucks, and we are working to have all food
trucks certified by the end of the 2019 season. We complement our food truck operations at Cadillac Square
and Beacon Park with recycling receptacles on?site during food truck hours.

We will also be expanding our onsite recycling program at our DDP-managed parks with permanent and
temporary receptacles that make recycling easier for the public. Beacon Park has permanent recycling cans.
This year, our parks rentals and special events will have recycling receptacles on site. We take our recycling
to Recycle Herel, a Detroit-owned local business.

RESTROOMS:
BEACON PARK: (2) ADA accessible public restrooms located on the back of the building.

Extra Porta-potties are brought in for all events.
