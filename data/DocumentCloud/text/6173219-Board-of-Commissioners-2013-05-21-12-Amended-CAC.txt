GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Central Advisory Council (CAC) is the jurisdiction wide resident council duly formed pursuant
to Federal regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at
24 CFR Part 964. Local Advisory Councils (LAC) are resident councils duly formed under Part 964,
and elected by CHA public housing tenants residing at various CHA developments. The Presidents of
each LAC constitute the Board of Directors for the CAC, and constitute a jurisdiction wide resident
council under Part 964. The CAC Board members meet after CHA tenants have formed LACs, and
elected LAC Presidents, and elect CAC officers from among those LAC Presidents serving on the
CAC Board. The elected CAC Board members elected as officers of the CAC Board, then serve as
members of the CAC Executive Committee.
Federal regulations at 24 CFR part 963 require tenant elections for all resident councils every four
years. The tenant elections for the CAC and the LACs have been delayed by complications arising
from a change in the procurement process for the selection of an election contractor. A Request for
Proposals (RFP) for Conducting and Managing the CAC/LAC Election was issued on August 10,
2012. An addendum to the RFP was issued on August 15, 2012. Two bids were received in response
to the RFP. The two bids received were from Gold Star Security, and the Alexis Bivens firm. The
total amount in the bid by Gold Star Security was $343,324.71, with $30,777.71 being allocated for
security. The total amount in the bid by the Alexis Bivens firm was 396,442.00, with $18,998.70
being allocated to security. The CAC had discussions with CHA officials on these bids regarding
CHA’s concerns with the cost contained in the bids. It was agreed that the matter would not be
presented to the CHA Board at that time, and that additional steps would be taken to address the cost
concerns expressed by CHA officials.
The Chicago HUD office was made aware of the delay resulting from the change in the procurement
process, and issued recommendations and guidance for the procurement process going forward, and
also recommended that the CHA and CAC reach an agreement to continue the recommended
procurement process and guidance, notwithstanding that the period for conducting the tenant
elections under Part 964 would be extended. The recommendations and guidance issued by the
Chicago HUD office included exploring whether an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Chicago
Board of Elections (CBOE) was an alternative to the procurement process. The CAC Election
Committee, comprised of tenants who will not be candidates in the upcoming followed the guidance
and recommendations issued by the Chicago HUD office. The CAC Election Committee and a CHA
official met several times with officials, and subsequently received a proposal for managing and
conducting the CAC and LAC tenant elections. The CBOE submitted a proposal and cost estimate in
January, 2013.
The CBOE proposal was evaluated by the CAC Election Committee, and compared with the two bid
proposals received in response to the Election Contractor RFP and Addendum. The CAC Election
Committee subsequently determined that Gold Star Security was the lowest responsible bidder.
Based on the above, it is recommended that the CHA Board of Commissioners authorize funding not
to exceed $188,867.64 for the CAC to negotiate and execute a contract with the Gold Star Security
to manage and conduct CAC and LAC elections in accordance with Federal regulations issued by
HUD at 24 CFR Part 964.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
