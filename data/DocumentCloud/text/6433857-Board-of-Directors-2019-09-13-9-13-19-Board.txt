Appendix

During the discussion of the information on the Direct Access Program on slide 10 of the presentation, Dr. Shannon
indicated that further information regarding the establishment of the Program will be provided to the Directors.
During the discussion of slide 37 regarding Full Time Equivalent Position Count, Director Reiter stated that he needs
more information regarding the vacant positions. What is the Day 1 plan? What jobs are we pulling back, in terms
of eliminating those vacancies? Chair Hammock requested that staff categorize the major vacancies for the Finance
Committee Meeting on September 20th.
Director Reiter communicated his concerns about eliminating the vacant positions and not working to solve the
revenue issue. He believes in the work that everyone has done to produce this preliminary budget, but eliminating
vacant positions sets the bar to a place where this organization does not want to be. With regard to the revenue issue,
for example, the Forest Preserve District of Cook County routinely takes natural growth on their property tax; on the
County side, they do not take natural growth, and that has created this issue. This County, under President
Preckwinkle, and this hospital system, under Dr. Shannon, have been very good stewards of the taxpayers’ money,
but at some point, County government will need to at least take the cost of living increase; when you don’t grow
your base, which is tax revenue, then it is shifting the responsibility.
Chair Hammock stated that he agreed with Director Reiter’s comments; the projections are clear, and this
organization cannot do this again next year.

Proposed CCH FY2020 Preliminary Budget and Impact 2023 Financial Forecast (continued)

Director Munar commented that CCH’s niche in the market continues to be that of a provider of uncompensated
care. CCH needs to find a market that is above the safety net, with those who will choose CCH. Chair Hammock
stated that this would be a good subject for a future discussion.
Director Driscoll stated that she agrees with Directors Reiter and Munar. CCH is a public option, and it has to fulfill
its historic mission, but it also needs to show that it provides high quality and safe services as well as any other
institution.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Driscoll, moved to adopt the proposed CCH FY2020
Preliminary Budget and Impact 2023 Financial Forecast. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Directors Munar and Reiter abstained.

 Bad Debt Is On The Rise Locally

Feel like the hospital is
shaking you down over that
bill? It probably is.
By Brigid Sweeney March 24, 2017

Even as the number of
Americans without health
insurance is at a record low,
Chicago hospitals are wrestling
with a metastasizing problem:

 FY2020 Success Factors
The FY2020 budget proposal aligns with the recently approved CCH strategic plan, IMPACT 2023,
however, success will depend on:
•

The ability to meet the uncompensated care demand. Growth in uncompensated care is
unsustainable with current revenues. Public Charge rule may further impact uncompensated
care.

•

Partnerships with labor, working on efficiencies and process improvements, and patientcentered focus

•

Entering into strategic partnerships with other providers to drive volume, expand access and
enhance quality

•

Stability of state and federal programs including the 340B prescription drug program,
Affordable Care Act and Medicaid including DSH (Disproportionate Share Hospital)

•

Implementing identified revenue cycle improvements based on best practices

•

Modest Medicaid membership growth and stable Medicaid rates

•

CountyCare members’ use of CCH services

•

Adapting to the dynamic larger healthcare environment
