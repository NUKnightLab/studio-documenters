RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CALLING ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO
AMEND THE PROPERTY TAX CODE TO EXEMPT COOK COUNTY
FROM THE APPLICATION OF PUBLIC ACT 96-1329
WHEREAS, On July 27, 2010, Governor Quinn signed House Bill 6126 into immediate effect as Public
Act 96-1329 (“PA 96-1329”); and
WHEREAS, PA 96-1329 amended Section 21-150 of the Illinois Property Tax Code to require that “all
applications for judgment and order of sale for taxes and special assessments on delinquent properties
shall be made within 90 days after the second installment due date”; and
WHEREAS, PA 96-1329 “â€¦never was intended to apply to Cook County” as reflected in the email as
Exhibit A from Will County Treasurer, Pat McGuire, to the Cook County Treasurer’s Office; and
WHEREAS, Cook County taxpayers are experiencing an overwhelming number of real property
foreclosures during these difficult economic times, and PA 96-1329 will further adversely affect Cook
County taxpayers by significantly shortening the period of time in which a taxpayer may pay delinquent
property taxes before their exposure to public sale, which in turn will put many thousands more Cook
County taxpayers at risk of losing their homes and businesses; and
WHEREAS, PA 96-1329 will necessitate that tax sale delinquency lists be finalized for publication only
two (2) months (or less) after the second installment due date, and based upon historical data it is
anticipated that the number of Cook County properties advertised for sale will more than double; and
WHEREAS, as a result of the anticipated increase in the number of Cook County properties advertised
for sale, the required certified mailing and newspaper publication costs, and tax sale automation expenses,
associated with the tax sale are projected to more than double; and
WHEREAS, it is anticipated that PA 96-1329 will result, year after year, in an overlap of the Annual Tax
Sale and the first installment property tax collection period; and

ITEM #5 cont’d
WHEREAS, PA 96-1329 will give rise to numerous additional financial consequences adverse to Cook
County taxpayers and Cook County, including substantially increased costs incurred by the State’s
Attorney’s Office, Treasurer’s Office and the Circuit Court as a result of an expected surge in the volume
of sales in error.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urge the
Illinois General Assembly to consider the risk of loss of homes and businesses by Cook County taxpayers
and the adverse financial consequences to Cook County that will result from the unfunded mandates of
PA 96-1329 and therefore to promptly pass legislation exempting counties with more than 3,000,000
inhabitants from its application.

Subject: Amendatory veto language for HB 6126
Colleagues,
Christ Balich of Gov. Quinn’s office this afternoon faxed me a letter dated June 3, 2010, from Cook
County Treasurer Maria Pappas to Gov.Quinn requesting an amendatory veto of HB 6126, the bill which
would allow a county treasurer to hold the annual tax sale any week in November.
To my knowledge, HB 6126 never was intended to apply to Cook County. However, my and Christ’s
examination of the bill this afternoon found no language exempting Cook County. Christ said that as long
as “both sides” agree on amendatory language, he would include the amendatory language in the bill
review he will forward to Gov. Quinn.
The deadline for the Governor to act on the bill is July 27. Christ told me the Governor does not like to
wait until the final day to act.
I just spoke with Jeff Hoffenberg, a lawyer on Pappas’ staff. We drafted the following language to insert
in HB 6126 at line seven before the word “Except”: “In any county with less than 3,000,000 inhabitants.”
I told Jeff I wanted to run this language by the bills’ sponsors, Sen. AJ Wilhelmi and Rep. Jack McGuire,
and Tim Bramlet. That’s the purpose of this email.

WHEREAS, the property tax levy and the sales tax are the two largest sources of revenue to fund the
operations of Cook County government; and

measurable and immediate savings of manual labor and associated costs; and
WHEREAS, streamlined work flows can decrease the amount of time required for completion of

WHEREAS, emphasizing a focus on outcomes is essential to determining the method and scope of
reforming internal policies and procedures, to ensure that any changes in the way government operates
will result in a higher level of service to the public at a reduced cost; and
WHEREAS, an estimated $300 million revenue reduction for Fiscal Year 2011 is projected, thus
indicating that due diligence and advanced planning will be essential to implementing the systemic
reforms necessary for absorption of the revenue loss with minimal disruption to public service.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners does hereby call upon the
Chief Financial Officer to outline economic assumptions for Fiscal Year 2011, and project a working
estimate of total available revenue for budgetary planning purposes; and

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #34
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 23, 2010 from
PATRICK M. BLANCHARD, Independent Inspector General
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $400.00 from Account 080260, Professional and Managerial Services, to Account 080-185, Professional and Technical Membership
Fees, to enable Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) investigators to become members of
the Association of Inspectors General (AIG), a professional organization offering training and
legal updates of developments within the Inspector General community.
Reason:

The Office of the Independent Inspector General is requesting a transfer of funds from
Account 080-260 to 080-185 to cover professional membership fees for OIIG investigators.
The OIIG has increased its investigative staff over the last year from three (3) investigators to
eleven (11), which includes the Inspector General and two (2) Deputies. This increase in
investigative staff has depleted the budget for professional membership fees as personnel
have joined the Association of Inspectors General to benefit from the group's training and

1. On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds in
order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was
the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On August 13, 2010, the OIIG was advised by the Budget Office that there was zero balance in the
Professional and Technical Membership Fees Account. On July 13, 2010, there was a balance of
$60.00.
2. How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts that
were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The OIIG identified Account 080-260 as the source of funds to supplement the Professional and
Managerial and Technical Membership Fees Account because the funds were available and it was
determined that, due to changing priorities, the intended activity for which the funds
were budgeted would not occur in FY 2010. Because of the surplus of funds available, this account
was the logical choice. There were no other accounts considered.

3. Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the
account that funds are transferred from 080-260.
Due to the changing priorities of the OIIG, the need for the Professional and Managerial Services
Account 080-260, was minimized. The money was intended to pay for professional assistance and
training in conducting desk audits and monitoring interviews. The workload and availability of
personnel assigned investigative matters has eliminated the possibility of these audits occurring this
fiscal year. Moreover, monitoring of interviews by this office is not yet required due to the
continuing jurisdiction of the Office of the Shakman Compliance Administrator. It is now anticipated
that these audits and monitoring will commence in FY 2011.
4. If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Not applicable.

CONTRACT RENEWALS continued
ITEM #36 cont’d
Reason:

This contract allows for three (3) one year renewal periods, each a "Renewal Term." This
renewal will generate new revenue; this is not a purchase. The Cook County Assessor's

manage direct advertising to be included in certain required mailings by the Cook County
Assessor's Office. This year's mailings will include required notifications to North Suburban
residents pertaining to the 2010 triennial reassessment and to other Cook County residents as
required by statute. The estimated revenue from this contract is over $80,000.00 which will
assist in offsetting the cost of these mailings.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Estimated Revenue: $80,000.00. Contract period: July 2, 2010 through
July 1, 2011. Requisition No. 10400003.
