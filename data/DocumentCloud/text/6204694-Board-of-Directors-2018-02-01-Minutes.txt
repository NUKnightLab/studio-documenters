Executive
Director’s
Report

Jim Wheaton provided the Board with several written reports, including the Pipeline Report, report on Resales, and an ARO update
report. Jim highlighted a couple of items:
Staffing update: The Outreach Coordinator position was posted on the City’s website on 12/28/17 and the application period
closed 1/11/18. All applications are reviewed by the HR Dept. to determine if they meet the threshold qualifications and this process
is underway at the time of the Board meeting. The next step is that the HR Dept. will determine a number of eligible applications for
interviews and arrange those interviews with the Executive Director and a representative of the DPD HR Dept. Once a candidate is
selected, a background check is performed (which takes 30-60 days).

ARO unit at Lexington Square IV (3600 S Morgan): A lottery drawing for this one CCLT unit in this 21-unit development was held
1 
 

.

  
on October 11. Subsequently, the selected Buyer dropped out and the Alternate chosen also decided not to purchase the unit. Jim
reported that new buyers had made an offer and the unit is under contract with a projected closing date of March 15, 2018. Sales
price is $217,000 for this 3-BR, 2.5-Ba townhome with a 2-car garage.
111 S. Peoria: This is an ‘Opt-in’ development and there are 8 CCLT units in this 79-unit luxury condo building under construction.
The CCLT units are all 1 BR with a sales price of $192,000. There are 10 eligible buyers who have been CCLT-approved.
Occupancy is projected for April 2018. The developer has agreed to hold the Condo Association fees for the CCLT units at
$100/month.
Resale units: There is one resale unit at 2808 W. North Avenue. The owners decided to sell in mid-December, and the unit is
already under contract with a CCLT-eligible buyer. Sales price is $211,000 for a 3-BR, 2-Ba condominium unit. Another CCLT
Resale at 235 W. Van Buren closed on December 28, 2017, with a sales price of $162,044 for a 1-BR, 1-Ba unit.

Other Units
2614 W. Fullerton: The ARO/CCLT unit in this development is a 2-BR, 2-Ba condominium selling for $178,000. The Application
Period opened on December 18 and will close on February 28, with a lottery drawing from among eligible applicants around the
middle of March. There have been many inquiries about this unit from potential CCLT buyers who were not chosen in the lotteries
for units in 2016 and others. Applications are coming and we expect that there will be at least 12 eligible Applicants in the lottery.
Oakley Square (2239 W Coulter): There will be one ARO/CCLT unit in this 34-unit development and it will be a 3 BR townhome
with a sales price of $228,000. CCLT staff met with the developer and his sales staff in November. The CCLT unit will be the
Model Home and any upgrades placed in the unit will be included to the CCLT buyer for the stated sales price.
