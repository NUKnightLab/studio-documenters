 Presentation / Discussion Items
Great Lakes Hyperloop System Public Involvement
Ms. Danielle Render highlighted items discussed at the previous External Affairs Committee
meeting related to the Hyperloop, including a comprehensive outreach and engagement plan
produced by NOACA’s consultant, Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc.
(TEMS). She noted that the plan has been used as a resource guide to help NOACA identify
stakeholders and convey the principles of selecting types of groups for engagement. The next
step will be to implement the strategic planning process to ensure there is a framework for allowing
input during the public involvement process. NOACA will update the Committee on various
approaches and engagement tools that will be used to create ongoing communications to support
a well-planned effort for public participation. Ms. Render discussed the following:
•
•
•
•

Public involvement framework
Public participation goals
Promise to the public
Tools of engagement

•
•
•

Conveying NOACA’s message
Hyperloop description
Great Lakes Hyperloop
Transportation System

Mayor Greg Zilka asked if NOACA staff thought about an express Hyperloop to Chicago with
stops in Toledo, Ohio and South Bend, Indiana. Ms. Gallucci stated that all trips will be express.
She noted that there will be no stops from Cleveland to Chicago, but there will be exits to several
cities. She stated that the Hyperloop system will be a hybrid of a plane and a train and will have
exit ramps.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that NOACA is currently working with all the metropolitan planning
organizations (MPOs) along the Hyperloop route. She noted that public outreach will be done in
the cities of Youngstown, Sandusky, Toledo, Pittsburgh, South Bend, and Chicago.
Ms. Gallucci announced that NOACA received a grant from the Richard King Mellon Foundation
for the Hyperloop in the amount of $100,000 that will be used to pay for additional research and
outreach for the Cleveland-Pittsburgh connection.
Chief McCall suggested that staff give a presentation on the Hyperloop at the National League of
Cities (NLC) Transportation Committee meeting and the NOACA Annual Meeting to get feedback

responsibilities as an MPO; and efforts will be made to grow the Agency’s stakeholder audience
and create a following to increase the Agency’s exposure and relationship building throughout the
region.
Ms. Render mentioned that NOACA is looking to set up a working committee to assist with
devising a plan of action to help the Agency connect to businesses, organizations, government
officials; provide direction to facilitate ongoing engagements; and elevate NOACA’s position and
priorities. She noted that meetings will be held on July 22, 2019, to provide members with an
opportunity to do some brainstorming and discuss goals on how to build partnerships. She
mentioned that there are no financial impacts with these initiatives.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA External Affairs Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

October 4, 2019

RE:

NOACA 2020 Legislative Agenda

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for
placement on the Board of Directors’ December agenda. Specifically, the item recommends the
2020 NOACA Legislative Agenda for adoption.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The NOACA Legislative Agenda is comprised of a platform of basic principals and specific
priorities for advocacy efforts in Washington D.C. and Columbus. The 2019 NOACA Legislative
Agenda was approved by the NOACA Board in December 2018. Similarly, the 2020 Legislative
Agenda will be used to inform audiences of the values and priorities of the NOACA region as they
relate to state and federal policy.
The basic principles in the Legislative Agenda do not change much from year to year, as they are
statements that reflect the core policy ideas of the Agency and are representative of fundamental
NOACA values articulated in the NOACA Regional Strategic Plan. Language representing
specific priorities included in the Legislative Agenda are subject to change more often, as the
intent is to identify specific state and federal policies currently under consideration. At this time,
the 2020 Legislative Agenda remains identical to the 2019 one.
However, the Committee may wish to give consideration to articulating additional actions that
address policy concerns highlighted in the current Legislative Agenda. The individual activities
would require significant planning and coordination to achieve, either through legislative or
administrative means. To this end, NOACA will engage the Committee in a discussion regarding
potential advocacy initiatives to augment our 2020 Legislative Agenda. For your reference, a
draft of the 2020 Legislative Agenda is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact.

5-1

 CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Committee discussion, the 2020 Legislative agenda will be finalized; and pending Board
approval, it will guide NOACA advocacy efforts during calendar year 2020.

 ABOUT NOACA
The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) is the federally designated metropolitan
planning organization for Northeast Ohio responsible for transportation and environmental planning. NOACA
prepares the region’s long-range transportation plan and short-range transportation improvement program,
which prioritizes and schedules federally funded transportation projects for the region. NOACA works with the
Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), project sponsors and other stakeholders to help address
Northeast Ohio’s transportation, air quality, and water quality needs.
Funding for NOACA’s transportation and environmental planning programs are derived from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), ODOT, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) and annual dues paid by local governments throughout the region.

ABOUT OUR AGENDA

DRAFT

2020
FEDERAL & STATE
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA

The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) Board of Directors and staff are proud to
present the 2020 Federal and State Legislative Agenda.
Transportation infrastructure empowers Ohioans to reach jobs, access healthcare, education, recreational
opportunities and see family and friends. Ideally, each of these destinations should be accessible by multiple
modes. Furthermore, the optimal alignment of infrastructure and economic activity is the foundation of regional
competitiveness. Uncertain funding impacts project delivery, increases congestion, jeopardizes safety, and
reduces economic throughput.
The basis for these requests is NOACA’s Long-Range Transportation Plan (LRTP), AIM Forward 2040. AIM
Forward 2040 directs investment of all forms of transportation over the next 20 years. With the year 2040 as
the planning horizon, NOACA will invest approximately $15.8 billion in the region’s transportation over the life
of the plan.
The NOACA Vision Statement is a fundamental touchstone that will be applied to regional programs, priorities,
and projects. It is critical that we develop relationships with our delegation and stakeholders. We look forward
to working with you and greatly appreciate your support.

The contents do not necessarily reflect official views or policies of the U.S. Department of Transportation or the Ohio Department of Transportation. This
document does not constitute a standard or regulation.

The Legislative Agenda represents consensus-driven principles that have been approved by
NOACA's 45-member Board of Directors in Northeast Ohio. It is intended to guide policy analysis
and advocacy on infrastructure issues. While NOACA's principles endure, the national
conversation and agenda on transportation infrastructure will change. In this way, NOACA can
assist public officials by advocating emerging issues with a non-partisan view.

5-3

 FEDERAL PRIORITIES

PRIORITY 1
Strengthen the MPO’s
local control of core
transportation
programs

This would include the Surface Transportation Program, Congestion
Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Program, and the Transportation
Alternatives Program. Directly allocating funding to MPOs and local
communities would create a more predictable revenue stream for
locally implemented priorities of air quality, improvement in mobility,
and investments in economic growth. Direct allocation would also
facilitate the ability of local communities to precisely define their funding
priorities such as funding for multimodal transportation strategies and
funding for transit.

PRIORITY 2
Promote asset
management as a
funding priority

PRIORITY 3
Incorporate safety,
sustainability,
multimodalism in
planning & funding

NOACA advocates that Congress should both revise the federal
funding formula to create a more equitable distribution of funds to local
communities and strengthen and expand local control to metropolitan
planning organizations by allocating more money directly to
regional/local authorities for core planning programs.

NOACA advocates that Congress should recognize the preservation of
transportation assets as an equal or greater economic priority as
compared to the development of new infrastructure. Regional
authorities similar to NOACA allocate as much as 90 percent of
available funding toward asset preservation. U.S. DOT has already
recognized this priority by mandating asset management programming
at the state level. NOACA advocates that the Congress should create
funding streams for asset management implementation – for transit,
road and bridge – at the regional/local level.

STATE PRIORITIES

PRIORITY 1
Improve the region’s
rate of return from
state allocated funds
to meet
regional asset
management needs

PRIORITY 2
Advocate for the
inclusion of multimodal
transportation within
state programs &
funding

NOACA advocates that the Ohio General Assembly review and amend
the state funding formula such that the NOACA region would receive an
equitable amount of State gas tax dollars as compared to what is
contributed by gas tax payers from the NOACA region.
The NOACA Board advocates a redress of this condition through the
creation of State programs that would allocate more funding to priorities
that are the sole responsibility of MPOs and local communities.
Formation of new programs or supplementing existing programs that
contribute funding to local and regional planning priorities such as asset
management programs would help create a more equitable rate of
return.
NOACA advocates that the Ohio General Assembly provide sufficient
funding for both capital and operating costs to support the development
and preservation of non-automobile transportation, particularly public
transit.
The Ohio Department of Transportation performed a comprehensive
assessment of current needs and long-term demands for transit in the
state. NOACA supports the findings and recommendations of the ODOT
study, which includes funding to bring Ohio’s public transportation
network into a state of good repair; and doubling statewide investment in
public transit, with the State of Ohio investing 10 percent of the
operating and capital costs of the needed service.

NOACA advocates that Congress should include safety, sustainability
and multimodalism as specific priorities within state and local MPO
planning requirements.
A specific focus should be to include public transit and hyperloop
funding programs.

WORKING TO ACHIEVE NOACA'S VISION:
NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional cohesion, PRESERVE existing infrastructure, and
BUILD a sustainable multimodal transportation system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality of life in Northeast Ohio.
