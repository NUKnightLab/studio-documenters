Elizabeth “Liz” Doody Gorman, Gregg Goslin, Joseph Mario Moreno, Anthony J.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION providing for the approval of the
2010 Preliminary Budget of the Cook County Health
& Hospitals System
WHEREAS, on June 3, 2008, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved
an Ordinance establishing the Cook County Health & Hospital’s System (“Enabling
Ordinance”); and

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
NOVEMBER 18, 2009
PAGE 32
WHEREAS, Section 38-83 of the Enabling Ordinance provides the following with
regard to the County Board’s approval of the System’s Preliminary Budget:
a. That the System Board shall recommend and submit a Preliminary Budget
for the System to the President of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners and the County Board, for approval by the County Board,
not later than forty-five (45) days prior to the first date for submission of
budget requests by the County’s Budget Director; and
b. That the County Board shall approve or reject each Preliminary Budget
within forty-five (45) days of submission to the County Board or such
Preliminary Budget is deemed approved; and
c. That the Preliminary Budget shall be included in the President’s Executive
Budget Recommendation; and
WHEREAS, Section 38-83 of the Enabling Ordinance further provides that after
approval of each Annual Appropriation Ordinance, the System Board has the
authority to make intra-fund transfers within the Health Fund, if necessary, to
accommodate any proposed revisions by the System Board to the line items set
forth in the Annual Appropriation Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, in previous years, the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation
Bill contained language providing that all funds appropriated to any account or
sub-account within Category 100 (Personal Services) shall remain fixed and
restricted to that category for which they were originally appropriated, and shall not
be subject to transfer to any impersonal account, or to any line item other than
those within the 100 Series, as listed in the Chart of Accounts; and
WHEREAS, consistent with the spirit and intent of the powers and authority
granted to the System Board by the County Board in the Enabling Ordinance, the
System wishes to adopt an enterprise fund model which would allow the System
Board through the System’s Chief Executive Officer to have authority (within the
confines of the total budget appropriation adopted by the County Board) over the
expenditure of funds allocated to the System by the County Board, notwithstanding
any limitations on funds appropriated to the 100 accounts in the County’s
Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill; and
WHEREAS, both the System Board (on July 16, 2009) and the County Board (on
July 21, 2009) approved a Master Lease Agreement for the System which
authorizes the System to lease capital equipment through an operating lease as
opposed to acquisition through financing by a bond issuance by the County; and
WHEREAS, the System wishes to acquire capital equipment for 2010 through this
Master Lease Agreement, and inasmuch as this action may occur prior to the
issuance of a bond by the County, the System wishes to be exempt from any
temporary “budget holds” that might occur at the County level pending discussion
and approval of bond issuance for certain purchases of capital equipment; and
WHEREAS, the System receives funds from various granting agencies which
funds are already accounted for in the System’s proposed Preliminary Budget and
the System wishes to have authority to approve and receive these grant funds
without having to return to the County Board for such approval; and
WHEREAS, on August 26, 2009, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System
Board of Directors approved the System’s Fiscal Year 2010 Preliminary Budget.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Preliminary Budget for Fiscal
Year 2010 of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System is approved; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the following conditions will be provided for in
the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2010:

 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
NOVEMBER 18, 2009
PAGE 33
1.

The System Board’s authority to make intra-fund transfers within the Health
Fund will include the ability to transfer funds in and out of Category 100

to the 100 accounts in the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill
for Fiscal Year 2010; and

2.

The System Board is authorized to acquire capital equipment for Fiscal Year
2010 through the Master Lease Agreement notwithstanding any “budget
holds” that might occur at the County level pending discussion and approval
of bond issuance for certain purchases of capital equipment; and

3.

The System Board is authorized to approve and receive grant funds which
are already appropriated by the County’s Resolution and Annual
Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2010 without seeking additional County
Board approval, notwithstanding any limitations on this authority in the
County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2010.

4.

In its quarterly reports to the County Board, the System shall include reports
on intra-fund transfers within the Health Fund; expenditures approved under
the Master Lease Agreement during a ‘budget hold’; and, the System
Board’s approval and receipt of any grant funds, during the preceding
quarter.
