RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE PETER N. SILVESTRI, JOHN P. DALEY, GREGG GOSLIN AND
TIMOTHY O. SCHNEIDER, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
SCHOOL SOUND INSULATION PROGRAM
WHEREAS, quality education is crucial for the future of not only a free and democratic society but also
of the very community in which a school is located; and
WHEREAS, Ridgewood High School has spent 50 years being dedicated to serving the youth of
Norridge and Harwood Heights and instilling in all of its students the desire to succeed in their future
endeavors by emphasizing that every student can learn and become a productive member of society; and
WHEREAS, a proper learning environment is essential to the productivity of a classroom, and that
protection from external noise is a reasonable expectation for such an environment; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is a member of the O’Hare Noise Compatibility Commission (ONCC), and is
aware that Ridgewood High School, Elk Grove High School and Carpenter Elementary School in Park
Ridge, qualified for sound insulation in 2004, and that despite the continuing noise imposed on them by
the air traffic from O’Hare International Airport (O’Hare), none of those schools has joined the ranks of
the 117 schools that have been awarded the benefit of sound insulation under the ONCC School Sound
Insulation Program; and
WHEREAS, the eligibility rules for sound insulation were changed in 2005 from an 8-hour 45 Leq (8)
(Equivalent Continuous Sound Level) to 60 DNL (a 24-hour day-night noise average) and, Ridgewood
High School, despite having qualified for sound insulation under the requirements that existed at the time
they were tested, was pushed off of the eligibility list by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); and

97

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 15, 2009
WHEREAS, since that time, the members of the ONCC have consistently and diligently worked for the
reinstatement to the insulation program of Ridgewood High School, Elk Grove High School, and
Carpenter Elementary School and believe that the students of these schools deserve the same learning
environment provided to the 117 schools around O’Hare that benefit from sound-insulation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County, urge that the FAA reverse its rulings and grant Ridgewood High School, Elk Grove High School
and Carpenter Elementary School in Park Ridge sound insulation so that their students can learn under the
same advantageous conditions as the 117 schools that have received this work.
Approved and adopted this 15th day of December 2009.

VETERAN PTSD SCREENING AND BENEFIT FAIRS
WHEREAS, it is estimated that more than 300,000 of the nearly 2 million U.S. servicemen and women
deployed since 9/11 suffer from the often debilitating condition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
with symptoms that include feelings of intense distress, nightmares, emotional numbness, relationship
problems, trouble sleeping, sudden anger, and drug and alcohol abuse; and
WHEREAS, the number of cases of PTSD is expected to climb as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
continue, and could ultimately exceed 500,000, according to a new study by researchers at Stanford
University; and

98

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 15, 2009
WHEREAS, mental health experts say PTSD is the primary reason suicides in the military are at an alltime high; 256 soldiers took their own lives in 2008, the highest number since that data was first tracked,
in 1980; and
WHEREAS, the economic downturn is hitting Iraq and Afghanistan veterans harder than other workers,
as one in nine are now unemployed; and
WHEREAS, in April 2009, the jobless rate for veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was 11.2%
while the corresponding rate for non-veterans was 8.8%; and
WHEREAS, there is a crisis with our young veterans who are in need of metal health services and
employment assistance; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has been aggressively building “collaborative
relationships” with non-profits, veterans organizations, doctors and hospitals to reach out to veterans to
offer information and services and Cook County should join in the national effort by reaching out to local
veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, does
hereby direct the Cook County Veterans Assistance Commission to work with Cook County
Commissioners, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans organizations, area hospitals and notfor profit organizations to organize PTSD screening and benefit fairs for veterans, in each of the 17
districts of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Veterans Assistance Commission shall
coordinate PTSD screening and benefit fairs in each Commissioner district every two years. The fairs
should include employers seeking candidates for employment, assistance with developing resumes,
mental health screenings, information on follow-up mental health services, and information regarding
veterans insurance and other benefits; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the PTSD screening and benefit fairs shall be located at Illinois
National Guard armories. If there is no armory in a commissioner’s district or if the armory is
unavailable, the Cook County Veterans Assistance Commission shall work with the specific
commissioner’s staff to find a suitable location.
Approved and adopted this 15th day of December 2009.

STATE’S ATTORNEY, Anita Alvarez, submitting communication advising the County of
the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator regarding Jimmy Doe v. County
of Cook, USDC No. 99-C-3945. This class action litigation was originally brought in 1999
and has subsequently involved the entry of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between
the parties that was approved by the District Court in December 2002 and the entry of an
Agreed Supplemental Order approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. This petition was
resolved by the entry of an Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator (TA) by
the District Court on August 14, 2007. The Board of Commissioners agreed to the entry of
the subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the TA Order
permitting the Transitional Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a separate account to
pay reasonable costs and expenses of the staff of the OTA. The OTA account was first
funded at $800,000.00 on July 22, 2008 and the District Court entered an order for additional

AMENDMENTS TO THE REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT CLASSIFICATION
ORDINANCE (PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT). Submitting a Proposed
Ordinance Amendment sponsored by Joan Patricia Murphy and Deborah Sims, County
Commissioners.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
ASSESSMENT CLASS 8B DESIGNATION
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 74
Taxation, Section 74-70 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:

146

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 15, 2009
Sec. 74-70. Class 8a and 8b Designation / Assessment Class
(a)
Class 8a. Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or commercial
purposes, which real estate would qualify for a Class 8 designation pursuant to Sections 7462 through 74-64, except for the fact that the qualifying use of the property prior to
application for the incentive does not comply with the definition of abandoned property
provided for in Section 74-62(b), can receive a designation as a Class 8a property so long as
the applicant can show that it has complied with all of the requirements necessary to receive a
Class 8 designation per Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for meeting the definition of
abandonment provided for in Section 74-62(b), but only when the Cook County Board of
Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such designation absent
abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of Class 8a designation absent
abandonment when:
a.

An applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from
the municipality in which the real estate is located or the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an agreement to abate a portion of the local
government's sales tax generated by the industrial or commercial
enterprise located on such real estate and such abatement of sales tax
must cover the period of time for which the applicant would qualify
for this Class 8a incentive; and

b.

Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners that due to national and regional economic
conditions beyond its control the industrial or commercial enterprise
has undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at
least 40 percent in the year it makes application for this incentive as
compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or
commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

c.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but
not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise is not economically
viable and as such it will cease operations within 60 days of the
submission of an eligibility application for Class 8a designation to
the Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the property will become
vacant and unused for an extended period of time of at least 24
months; and

d.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but
not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
designation as a class 8a property will allow the industrial or
commercial enterprise to be economically viable and thereby
continue its operations so that the industrial or commercial enterprise
can continue to occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an
extended period of time.

147

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 15, 2009
(2)

(3)

(4)

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a
significant reduction in net operating income of at least 40 percent in
the year it makes application for the incentive as compared to the
average net operating income of the industrial or commercial
enterprise in the prior three years; and

b.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that Class 8a designation of the property is necessary for
the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise to continue its
operations and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to become vacant and unused; and

c.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the designation of the property as a Class 8a
property absent an abandonment requirement; and

d.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the application made to the Cook County
Assessor requesting designation as a Class 8a property absent an
abandonment requirement.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and
designation as a class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this
section, the municipality in which the real estate is located must provide to
the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the
following:
a.

A finding by the municipality that it has determined that class 8a
designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or
commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that without
such designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would not
be economically viable causing the property to become vacant and
unused; and

b.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the
action by the Cook County Board of Commissioners to support
designation of the property as a Class 8a property; and

c.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the
class 8a application to the Cook County Assessor; and

Real estate receiving a Class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this
section shall be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value provided
for in Section 74-64(11), however the term of the incentive will be limited to
five years only and such Class 8a designation shall not be renewed:

148

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 15, 2009
a.

After the initial application has been approved and granted, if the
subject real estate receiving the Class 8a designation pursuant to the
provisions of this section is sold or the applicant transfers ownership
of any portion of the property at any time prior to the five-year term
of the 8a classification, then the property's Class 8a classification
shall be subject to an eligibility review by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, the municipality, and the Assessor under the
procedures set forth in this Ordinance for the remainder of the fiveyear term.

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8a designation an eligibility
application must be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation can not be applied to real estate unless the following has
occurred: application is made to the Cook County Assessor; all required
municipal and county ordinances and resolutions are provided to the Cook
County Assessor; and the Cook County Assessor determines that the real
estate which is the subject of the application for a Class 8a designation would
qualify for designation as a Class 8 property but for the inability to comply
with the definition of abandonment pursuant to Section 74-62(b).

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this section to
determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a Class 8a designation, the Cook
County Assessor shall forward such application and any supporting
documentation provided with such application to the Cook County Board of
Commissioners or its designee for consideration as to whether the County
Board will provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a Class 8a
designation absent abandonment.

(9)

Real estate receiving a Class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this
section shall not be eligible for a Class 8a designation for any year prior to
the assessment year for which an application for the designation is made to
the Cook County Assessor.

(10)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee may adopt rules
consistent with this section that may be needed to ensure proper review of
information, data and documents submitted in support of a request to the
County Board for a resolution or ordinance in support of a Class 8a
designation as provided for in this section.

(11)

Applicants for a Class 8a designation of property can only make such an
application for the following assessment years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012,
2013 and the Cook County Assessor shall not designate any real estate as
Class 8a property for assessment year 2018 or thereafter.

(12)

Real estate that receives a designation as a Class 8a incentive property will
lose such designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment, if
the industrial or commercial enterprise located on the property ceases
operations and the subject real estate becomes vacant and unused.

149

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 15, 2009
(13)

Real estate that receives a designation as a Class 8a incentive property will
lose such designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment
upon termination of the required partial sales tax abatement by local
government.
This Section 74-70 of the Real Estate Classification Ordinance will become
effective upon passage.

(b)
Class 8b. Real estate and improvements that house inpatient and outpatient
hospital based services, where the property has been acquired for hospital use by a for-profit
acquirer unrelated to the not-for-profit disposer, thereby avoiding Illinois Health Facilities
and Services Review Board discontinuation approval, shall be considered for a class 8b
designation if it meets the requirements of this section and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such designation.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of class 8b designation when:
a.

the applicant is a hospital, as defined in the Hospital Licensing Act,
or an entity that owns the real property on which a hospital is
located, the hospital is licensed by the state, and the abandonment of
the hospital would require the applicant, or the hospital on behalf of
which the applicant owns the real property on which the hospital is
located, to obtain a permit or exemption from the State of Illinois
Health Facilities and Services Review Board pursuant to the Illinois
Health Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing hospital
operations and to obtain a second permit or exemption prior to reopening or otherwise re-establishing the hospital after abandonment;

b.

the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County
Assessor that approval of the class 8b designation will materially
increase the likelihood that the property will be retained for hospital
use with the associated employment benefits relative to industrial or
commercial use of the property;

c.

the subject hospital is located in a zip code which has a 10 percent or
greater incidence of families and/or individuals below the poverty
level, as identified by the U.S. Census Bureau's most recent census;
and

d.

the subject hospital employs at least 750 full-time equivalents (fulltime equivalent jobs being defined as total hours worked by all non
full-time employees divided by average annual hours worked by the
full-time employees).

150

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 15, 2009
(2)

(3)

(4)

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Cook County Assessor that approval of the class 8b designation will
materially increase the likelihood that the property will be retained
for hospital use; and

b.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the designation of the property as a class 8b
property.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and
designation as a class 8b property is sought using the provisions of this
section, the municipality in which the real estate is located must provide to
the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the
following:
a.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that the
proposed redevelopment contemplated for the subject hospital or the
property on which the hospital sits is necessary and appropriate and
that, without a classification having the impact of this section, the
special circumstances that exist on the property on which the subject
hospital sits including but not limited to the unique requirement that
mandates that the subject hospital's operations are continually
maintained without interruption in order for the State of Illinois
Health Facilities and Services Review Board to issue a certificate of
need and licensure approval for the continued operation of the
subject hospital and the extraordinary need for the continued
operation of the subject hospital within the applicable region, will
not be addressed and the property on which the subject hospital sits
will become vacant and underutilized and cause the continued
exasperation of blighted factors within the municipality and region;

b.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that a
classification having the impact of this section is necessary for the
redevelopment to occur on the property on which the subject hospital
sits; and

c.

a statement by the corporate authorities of the municipality
supporting and consenting to the filing of an application for a
classification having the impact of this section for the property on
which the subject hospital sits.

Real estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this
section shall be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value and for the
term provided for in Section 74-64 (11).

151

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 15, 2009
(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8b designation, a class 8 or class
8b application must be made or have been made to the Cook County
Assessor. Any application for class 8 submitted with required municipal
approval after July 1, 2008 for hospital property where the property was
acquired for hospital use by an unrelated for-profit acquirer, avoiding the
Health Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation approval, shall
be reconsidered as an application pursuant to this section upon supplement of
such class 8 application with the additional information required in this
section, if any. Upon receipt of an application, the Cook County Assessor
shall forward such application and any supporting documentation provided
with the application to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for
consideration as to whether the Cook County Board will provide a resolution
or ordinance in support of a class 8b designation. Real estate receiving a
class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be
eligible for such designation beginning in the assessment year during which
an application for the classification having the impact of this section is made
to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8b designation cannot be applied to real estate unless the following has
occurred: application is made or has been made to the Cook County
Assessor, and all required municipal and county ordinances and resolutions
are provided to the Cook County Assessor.

Effective date. This Amended Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon adoption.

reasonably be corrected within five days, then within such five-day period the grantee shall respond in
writing identifying the steps which have been taken by grantee to correct such violation and the time
frame reasonably necessary to complete such corrective action, and if the County is satisfied with the
corrective action to be undertaken and approves the time frame requested, grantee shall have such
additional time as is agreed by the County to complete such corrective action.
(d)
Stop work order. As to permit violations, if such violation is not completely corrected
within ten days after the notice described above, then notwithstanding any additional cure period which
may be granted in accordance with Section 66-88(c), or in the case of an incurable violation in the
discretion of the Superintendent, the Highway Department may also issue a "stop work" order under the
permit. In addition to the foregoing, if at any time the Highway Department determines that a grantee's
insurance has lapsed or that the continuance of the work is likely to cause imminent harm to persons or
property, the Highway Department may issue a "stop work" order until such matter is corrected.
Sec. 66-91.

Penalties.

The Superintendent (and the Director, in the case of a violation of a license agreement) may
impose a fine of not less than $100.00 and not more than $1,000.00 for each offense (unless another
specific fine has been specifically provided for by the Board), upon any person who violates, disobeys,
omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this article, a license agreement or a
permit. Each day that a violation continues after expiration of applicable cure periods constitutes a
separate and distinct offense. The current amounts of specific fines are set forth in Section 66-102. These
penalties shall be in addition to any other costs or damages incurred by the County.
(a)
Suit to enforce payment. If any person fails to remit any penalties required pursuant to
this article upon request of the Superintendent or the Department of Revenue, the State's Attorney may
bring, or cause to be brought, an action to enforce payment.
(b)
Violations of the provisions in this article are declared to be public nuisances. If any
person fails to remit any penalties required pursuant to this article, the Superintendent or the Department
of Revenue may utilize the administrative hearing process provisions, set out in Chapter 2, Article IX of
this Code, to enforce the provisions of this article, adjudicate liability, and enforce payment. The
provisions of this subsection shall be applied prospectively and retroactively, regardless of the date of the
violation.
Approved and adopted this 15th day of December 2009.

In the event any person is compelled to, or deems it advisable to, install any new

reasonably necessary in order to allow sufficient time for such installation such exemption may be
granted by the Director on good cause shown. Upon complaint in writing by any such person setting forth
that it is impossible in the operation of any plant, fuel-burning, combustion or process equipment or
device, or apparatus, to operate the same in complete compliance with the requirements of this chapter,
and stating evidence satisfactory to the Director that such person has taken, or will take all steps necessary
to provide for future compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and giving assurance to the Director
that the acquisition and installation of the proper equipment, process, device, or appliance, or control
equipment, will be effected within a reasonable period of time, stating specifically by nature and extent
thereof, and upon the finding by the Director on investigation of the facts, that the complaint is well
grounded, the Director is authorized to permit the operation of such plant, fuel-burning, combustion, or
process equipment or device, or apparatus, for a reasonable period of time within which period necessary
equipment, process, device, means or methods, or control equipment, is to be acquired and installed. The

Variances.

pollution, or any rule, regulation, requirement, or previous order of the Director, will result in an arbitrary
and unreasonable taking of property or in the practical closing and elimination of any lawful business,
occupation, or activity, in either case without a sufficient corresponding benefit or advantage to the
people in the reduction of atmospheric pollution; in such case, there shall be prescribed other and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 15, 2009
JUVENILE TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER
CONTRACTS
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 18, 2009 from
EARL L. DUNLAP, Transitional Administrator, Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Isaac Ray Center (IRC),
Chicago, Illinois, for mental health services for residents of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
(JTDC) in a manner that is consistent with the National Commission on Correction Health Care
(NCCHC), the American Correctional Association (ACA) and the requirements set forth in a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) approved by the Federal District Court in the case of Doe v. Cook
County, Case No. 99 C 3945, and in the extension of the Memorandum of Agreement through the
Modified Implementation Plan (MIP). Services rendered shall be performed in accordance with the
requirements of the MIP and shall include intake screening, management of acute and chronic mental
health conditions, referrals to psychiatric hospitals, mental health treatment for JTDC residents and
administrative functions. IRC personnel assigned to the JTDC shall include a Director of Services,
psychiatrists and clinical psychologists and may include advanced practice nurses, physician assistants,
registered nurses, psychometricians, social workers, information technology specialists, support staff,
Fellows engaged in post-graduate clinical training programs under appropriate supervision and any other
appropriate personnel. In addition, IRC shall continue to prepare appropriate policies and procedures for
services at the JTDC which comply with the changing requirements of the Juvenile Standards of the
NCCHC and ACA accreditation standards.
Reason:

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the Agreed Order appointing a Transitional Administrator, Doe v.
Cook County, Case No. 99 C 3945, the Office of the Transitional Administrator, in its
authority as established in the Court Order entered on August 14, 2007, has selected Isaac Ray
Center (IRC) to provide mental health services to residents of the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center (JTDC). Currently, IRC provides mental health services to JTDC residents
in conjunction with the Mental Health Services for Cermak Health Services of Cook County,
Contract No. 06-45-574. Cermak Health Services of Cook County is in the process of making
changes to its Mental Health Services program, and intends to do a Request for Proposal
(RFP) for mental health services. Because of the existing relationship that IRC currently has
with the JTDC, the Office of the Transitional Administrator, in its authority, has chosen to
retain Isaac Ray Center as its mental health services provider for JTDC residents. This
decision was made in an effort to avoid any disruption in mental health services to the JTDC
residents. The current contract with Cermak Health Services of Cook County is scheduled to
end on August 31, 2010; however, this contract does not currently provide the necessary level
of services as required by the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and the Modified
Implementation Plan (MIP) in the Doe v. Cook County, Case No. 99 C 3945. The new
contract will provide the appropriate level of staffing to enable the Cook County Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center to come into compliance with mental health care objectives as
outlined in the MOA and MIP. The contract will be performance based, and will be renewed
annually if performance requirements are achieved. The performance measurements will be
determined collaboratively by the Office of the Transitional Administrator and Isaac Ray
Center, and will be outlined in the contractual agreement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $16,319,621.00 (FY 2010: $3,905,747.00; FY 2011: $4,019,559.00; FY 2012:
$4,136,786.00; and FY 2013: $4,257,529.00). Contract period: December March 1, 2009 2010 through

Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2011, 2012 and 2013 funds.
