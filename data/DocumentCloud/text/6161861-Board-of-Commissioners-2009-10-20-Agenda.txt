Communication from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee,
submitting a request from William D. McLeod, Mayor, Village of Hoffman Estates.
Re: No Cash Bid Request Package for the Village of Hoffman Estates.
We are requesting that a No Cash Bid request be made on behalf of the Village for the
following property:
VILLAGE OF HOFFMAN ESTATES
PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER

VOLUME

This request package contains one (1) Property Index Number (PIN). This property is the
Brookside pond that currently has no legal property owner. It is a retention pond used for
Village drainage and is in Schaumburg Township. It is not being maintained and is dirty
and foul smelling and is creating an erosion problem for adjoining properties. The Village
would like to clean and maintain the pond and attempt to prevent further erosion onto the
adjacent properties. This would be of great benefit to the residents and Village of
Hoffman Estates. The Village will file for a tax exempt status for this property as we will
retain the property for municipal use.
Additionally, the Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal
and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel. The Village also agrees to
submit, to the Cook County Office of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on
the status of this parcel for five years, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid
Ordinance.
