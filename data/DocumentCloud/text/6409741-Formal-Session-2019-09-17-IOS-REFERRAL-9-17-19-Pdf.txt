On September 10, 2019, a case evaluation panel evaluated the above-captioned lawsuit and
awarded Seventy Five Thousand Dollars and NO/Cents in favor of the plaintiff.
The parties have until October 8, 2019, to either accept or reject the case evaluation. Failure to
?le a written acceptance or rejection within this period constitutes a rejection.

Based upon our review of the facts and particulars of this lawsuit, which are set forth in a

Honorable Body, it is our considered opinion that a settlement in the amount of Seventy Five
Thousand Dollars and N0/Cents is in the best interest of the City of Detroit.

We, therefore, request Your Honorable Body to authorize acceptance of the case evaluation
award; and, in the event Plaintiff accepts the award, to deem such acceptance as a settlement and
to direct the Finance Director to issue a draft in that amount payable to Russell Gordon and their
attorney, Whiting Law, to be delivered upon receipt of properly executed Releases, Stipulation
and Order of Dismissal entered in Lawsuit and, where deemed necessary by
