RE: Economic Hardship Exemption in Special Assessment Districts

Your Honorable Body, through the Budget, Finance, and Audit Standing Committee, has
forwarded a memorandum from the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) dated June 5, 2019,
regarding the above-referenced topic with a proposed ordinance attached for Corporation
Counsel?s review and approval as to form. We are now responding to this request.

SHORT ANSWER

Taxes and special assessments are distinct under the law. While it is clear that special
assessments on the basis of bene?ts received are not general property taxes, they are collected in
the same manner as property taxes. There are no instances of relief from special assessments
absent speci?c statutory exemptions (such as a Business Improvement Zone pursuant to MCL
125.990h).

The process for collection of unpaid taxes and special assessments is clear under the 2012
Detroit City Charter, state statutes and the 1984 Detroit City Code. The City Treasurer is mandated
to forward delinquent real property taxes to the Wayne County Treasurer for collection but has the
discretion, in certain circumstances, to determine which unpaid City taxes (or special assessments)
to withhold. Delinquencies not returned to the Wayne County Treasurer remain a debt owed to
the City of Detroit and are subject to collection efforts. There is no legal mechanism for the
Treasurer or Assessor to ?exempt? or ?forgive? special assessments levied in a Special Assessment
District.

A legal challenge in the Michigan Tax Tribunal or pursuit of a petition to discontinue a
Special Assessment District (SAD) are the only mechanisms available to obtain relief from a
special assessment levied in a SAD. The Treasurer may exercise their discretion and withhold
special assessments from Wayne County but the special assessment remains a lien on the property
subject to collection. The impact this activity would have on an established or prospective SAD
should be explored prior to this action taking place. Therefore, the preposed ordinance amendment
drafted by the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) is impermissible under the City Charter, relevant
case law and is preempted by state law.

Lastly, the signature of the petition circulator is required under Sec. 18-12-126(c) of the
1984 Detroit City Code.

Hon. City Council

BACKGROUND

The local ordinance creating Special Assessment Districts (SAD) pursuant to the Home
Rule City Act at MCL 117.5i was adopted by City Council on April 29, 2014 and effective June
9, 2014 (Ord. No. 07-14 codi?ed at Section 18-12-120 et seq.). State law permits municipalities
with a population of more than 600,000 to provide, by ordinance, for the creation of a Special
Assessment District and a procedure to ?nance certain activities via a special assessment within
that district. The statute contains requirements for establishing and discontinuing the district;
however, it is silent on the collection of unpaid special assessments.

The SAD ordinance was amended by Ordinance No. 09-15, adopted by City Council on
February 3, 2015 and effective April 28, 2015. The amendment prohibits the establishment of a
SAD where the unpaid general taxes or special assessments are equal to or greater than 40% of the
total tax assessments or special assessments due in the proposed SAD area.

The threat of foreclosure for non?payment of special assessments is a serious issue that was
given considerable focus and attention when the original ordinance was enacted in 2014 as well as
when the delinquency threshold was set at 40% in 2015. While the 40% threshold expands the
opportunity to create a SAD in areas that cannot meet a higher threshold, it also increases the tax
burden and threat of foreclosure in those same areas.

In a 2015 opinion, the Law Department addressed the ability of City Council to enact an
ordinance prohibiting the City Treasurer from forwarding delinquent special assessments to
Wayne County. It addresses preemption, the proper treatment of unpaid special assessments in a
SAD under state law, the 2012 Detroit City Charter as well as applicable City Code provisions.
Please refer to the attached Law Department opinion titled Whether the City May Lawfully Enact
an Ordinance Limiting the Availability of Foreclosure as a Remedy in the Collection of Unpaid
Assessments in a Special Assessment District Created Pursuant to MCL 117.5i, dated February
23, 2015, as it is relevant though not repetitive to our current discussion.

LAW ANALYSIS

Collection of Unpaid Taxes under State Law

The General Property Tax Act (GPTA), MCL 211.1, et seq., provides for the assessment,
levying and collection of property taxes. The Treasurer is mandated to collect taxes1 and follow
the process and procedures set forth in the GPTA. The enabling SAD statute (MCL 117.5i) does
not provide alternative enforcement mechanisms for unpaid special assessments in a SAD, instead
it relies on the current statutory fran'iework,2 which is supported by the City?s Charter and Code as
set forth in our 2015 opinion.

 

1MCL 211.44 and 211.8913.
2 MCL 211.78, et seq.

Hon. City Council

Re: Economic Hardship Exemption in SADs
June 14, 2019

Page 3

 

 

Pursuant to MCL the Wayne County Treasurer is the foreclosing
governmental unit and is responsible for the collection of delinquent City of Detroit taxes.3 Unpaid
special assessments are included in the de?nition of ?taxes? and collected pursuant to the
procedures set for in the GPTA for the collection of delinquent property taxes.4 MCL 211.55
grants the Treasurer discretion in returning special assessments to Wayne County for collection:

A township treasurer or other collecting officer may include as a
delinquent tax any unpaid special assessment which is delinquent on
the last day of February in the delinquent taxes returned to the
county treasurer the next day pursuant to this section. A delinquent
special assessment included as a delinquent tax pursuant to this
section shall, after return to the county treasurer, be a valid tax for

all purposes under this act.
(Emphasis Added.)

This grants the Treasurer discretion to not return an unpaid assessment to Wayne County
as delinquent; it does not authorize an exemption or reduction in the amount of a special
assessment, it just shifts the burden of collection from the County to the City. Consistent with our
analysis in the 2015 opinion regarding limiting foreclosure as a remedy, the Treasurer?s discretion
in returning special assessments to Wayne County for collection as delinquent taxes under state
law cannot be abrogated via ordinance.

2012 Detroit City Charter Provisions

In accordance with Section 8?604 of the 2012 Detroit City Charter, special assessments are
liens on the property and debts of the person until paid. The same section of the Charter permits
delinquent special assessments to be collected by the Treasurer, at his/her discretion, as delinquent
city property taxes. This is consistent with the provisions in the GPTA outlined above.

Sec. 8-604. Assessment Lien.

From the date of con?rmation of any roll levying any special
assessment, the full amount of the assessment and all interest
thereon shall constitute a lien on the property subject thereto and
that amount shall also be a debt of the person to whom assessed until
paid and, in case of delinquency, may be collected as delinquent city

property taxes.
(Emphasis Added.)

 

3 Prior to 2003, the City of Detroit was responsible for collecting its own delinquent taxes. Public Act 246 of 2003
amended the General Property Tax Act to require the City of Detroit to collect all property taxes (state, county and
city) levied after December 31, 2003, and to return all uncollected delinquent taxes to Wayne County for collection.
4 MCL 211.78a provides that used in section 78, this section, and sections T?b to 7911, "taxes? includes interest.
penalties, and Fees imposed before the taxes become delinquent and unpaid special assessments or other assessments
that are due and payable up to and including the date of the foreclosure hearing under section 78k.

Hon. City Council

Re: Economic Hardship Exemption in SADs

Property taxation and collection matters, including the foreclosure of liens, are outlined in
Section 8-403 of the Charter which provides, in relevant part, that:

Sec. 8-403. Collection of Property Taxes.
1. Except as otherwise provided by this Charter or ordinance,
the rights, duties, powers, and immunities established by state law
shall apply in the collection and enforcement of city property taxes.
2. City property taxes shall become a debt of the persons liable
for them on the date provided by state law and shall become payable,
and a lien upon the property, on the ?rst (lst) day of the city's ?scal
year or such other date as may be provided by ordinance.

as
7. In addition to the other remedies speci?ed in this section, at
the time unpaid city property taxes become delinquent or at any later
time permitted by law, the city may maintain a personal action
against the debtor for collection of the unpaid property taxes and
may use any means permitted by law for collection of the debt.
The City of Detroit tax roll shall be prima facie evidence of the
amount of the indebtedness to the City of Detroit. The preceding
sections of 8-403 are not the exclusive remedies of the City of
Detroit.
8. In addition to the procedures and remedies for the collection
and enforcement of the property taxes set forth in the Charter, the city
or other lienholder may use any procedure and remedy for the
collection and enforcement of property taxes established by state

law.
(Emphasis Added.)

The City?s ordinance regarding Special Assessment Districts, which provides that unpaid
special assessments shall be a lien on the pr0perty and enforced as a special assessment lien or tax
lien, conforms to the provisions in state law, City Charter and City Code outlined above. It
provides:

Sec. 18-12-138. Special Assessments as Lien
From the date of con?rmation of the special assessment roll, any
unpaid Tax Parcel Share . . . shall be a lien on the associated Tax
Parcel, and shall also be a debt of the Record Owner. The lien shall
be of the same character and effect as the lien created for
municipal property taxes and shall accrue interest and penalties in
the same manner. The lien shall be enforced in the same manner
prescribed in state law, the Detroit City Charter and this Code for the
enforcement of special assessment liens or tax liens.

(Emphasis Added.)

Hon. City Council

Re: Economic Hardship Exemption in SADs
June 14, 2019

Page 5

 

 

While the City Treasurer has discretion in the return of special assessments as delinquent
and the manner in which to attempt collection of the debt, they cannot ?exempt,? choose to not
levy or forgive a special assessment as it is a lien against the real property. The ordinance at Sec.
sets forth tax parcels ?exempt? from a SAD levy:

The United States;

Any state (including Michigan);

The City of Detroit;

Any public school district; or

Any authority, municipal corporation, school district, or other governmental or quasi-
governmental entity exempted from payment of special assessments by statute or other
applicable law.



Section 18-12-136, Exempt Tax Parcels, also explicitly states at subsection that:

Tax Parcels exempt by a Record Owner listed in subsection shall be
exempt regardless of the use or purpose of such Tax Parcel. All other
Tax Parcels are subject to a special assessment created under this
division, even if such Tax Parcels are exempt from property taxes
under Michigan?s General Property Tax Act, MCL 211.1 et seq.,
unless such Tax Parcels are otherwise exempt from special
assessments under applicable law.

(Emphasis Added.)

The Cityr is Precluded from Extending Hardship Exemptions or Other Relief from a SAD Levy

While special assessments are collected and enforced in the same manner as property taxes
pursuant to the above-referenced provisions, they are distinct under the law. Although it resembles
a tax, a special assessment is not a tax. Knott v. City of lint, 363 Mich. 483, 497 (1961). A special
assessment refers to ?a levy upon property within a speci?ed district,? the purpose of which is ?to
recover the costs of improvements that confer local and peculiar bene?ts upon property within a
de?ned area.? Kadzban v. City ofGrandville, 442 Mich. 495, 500 (1993).

In a case directly on point, In re Petition of Auditor General, 226 Mich. 170 (1924), the
question of exemption from liability for a special assessment based on an exemption of the general
tax law was at issue. The Michigan Supreme Court held that ?the association whose property was
involved and which was organized for benevolent and charitable purposes was exempt from a
general village tax levied in connection with the construction of sewers, but its liability was
recognized for the payment of a special assessment of a portion of such cost raised pursuant to
charter provisions in that manner.? In holding that an exemption from property taxes does not
relieve the property owner from special assessments levied the Court noted:

There is a clear distinction between what are termed general taxes and
special assessments. The former are burdens imposed generally upon
property owners for governmental purposes, without regard to any special
bene?t which will inure to the taxpayer. The latter are sustained upon the

Hon. City Council

Re: Economic Hardship Exemption in SADs
June 14, 2019

Page 6

 

 

 

 

 

theory that the value of the property in the special assessment district is
enhanced by the improvement for which the assessment is made.

In Blake v. Metropolitan Chain Stores, 247 Mich. 73 (1929), the parties entered into a lease
which required the lessee to pay ?all taxes? and the question of whether this included liability for
a Special assessment was litigated. The Michigan Supreme Court again distinguished between the
two noting that special assessment is laid on the property specially bene?ted by a local
improvement, in proportion to the bene?t received for the purpose of defraying the cost of the
improvement.? As to taxes the Court stated ?[t]he word ?taxes? presents to the mind exactions to
defray the ordinary expenses of the government and the promotion of the general welfare of the
country. It is not generally understood as applying to improvements, levied upon property with a
resultant bene?t thereto to the amount thereof. It must be assumed, as determined by the
commissioner, that the value of plaintiffs? property was bene?ted by the improvement made to the
amount of the assessment levied against it.?

It should also be noted that the limit and rollback provisions contained in the 1963
Michigan Constitution, Article IX, Finance and Taxation, at Section 6, Real and tangible personal
property; limitation on general ad valorem taxes; adoption and alteration of separate tax
limitations; exceptions to limitations; property tax on school district extending into 2 or more
counties, do not apply to special assessments as distinguished from general ad valorem taxes. Niles
V. Berrien County Bd. 0f Com ?rs, 261 Mich.App. 308 [2004). The Michigan Supreme Court
interpreted the former constitutional provision (Article 10, Section 21 of the 1908 Michigan
Constitution) in the same manner - special assessments are not taxes within the meaning of
constitutional tax limitations. Graham v. Saginaw, 317 Mich. 427 (1947). The tax limitations in
the 1908 Constitution were comparable to the millage limitations in Article IX of our current state
constitution.

Treatment of Solid Waste Fees and Special Assessments are Not Interchangeable

The City?s solid waste fee is a fee5 for servicef' not a tax or special assessment so it is an
improper comparison for the purpose of providing an example of an exemption to a levy. Rather
than being an exercise of the municipal power to tax, the imposition of a fee constitutes an exercise
of a municipalities? police power to regulate public health, safety, and welfare. Bolt v. City of
Lansing, 459 Mich. 152 (1998); Merrelli v. St Clair Shores, 355 Mich. 575, 583 (1959). A more
appropriate comparison would be the special assessments levied by the City for sidewalk
replacement. The amount is calculated by the number of concrete ?ags needing replacement on a
speci?c tax parcel.

Beginning in 1976, the City collected a 3 mill garbage disposal levy. The millage was
replaced by annual solid waste fees ["or residential trash collection and solid waste inspection fees
on commercial buildings and certain apartment buildings that contracted with private solid waste

 

5 Wolf v. Detroit, 287 Mich. App. 184 (2010) vacated by 489 Mich. 923 (2011).

6 The solid waste collection charge is a user fee. A user fee is a fee paid by those receiving speci?c services from
the government. The revenue from such fees are dedicated to the services provided and the amount of the fee is
based on the value of the service provided. Bolt v. Cin- of Lansing, 459 Mich 152 (1998).

Hon. City Council

Re: Economic Hardship Exemption in SADs
June 14,2019

Page 7

 

collectors for disposal services. To implement the switch from the millage-generated revenue to
the fee-generated revenue, City Council passed Ordinance No. 18-06 on June 30, 2006. This
ordinance amended various ordinances within Chapter 22 of the City Code. Amid ongoing legal
challenges, the City advocated for and the legislature amended the General Property Tax Act with
Public Act 512 of 2008 (effective January 13, 2009; copy attached) to authorize the City to place
the solid waste fee on tax bills and return the delinquent amounts to the Wayne County Treasurer
for foreclosure.

MCL 211.89c also grants the City the discretion to return delinquent solid waste fees to
Wayne County. As previously discussed in this opinion as well as our 2015 Opinion, it is legally
impermissible to restrict via ordinance the discretionary powers of the Treasurer to withhold items
from the tax rolls returned to Wayne County as delinquent.

Legal Challenge of a Special Assessment and Certi?cation of Petitions

It is well-recognized that special assessments are presumed valid and should generally be
upheld. Kadzban v. City of Grandville, 442 Mich. 495 (1993). A special assessment will be deemed
valid if it meets two requirements: (1) the improvement subject to the special assessment must
confer a bene?t on the assessed property and not just the community as a whole and (2) the amount
of the special assessment must be reasonably proportionate to the bene?t derived from the
improvement. Kadzban, 442 Mich. at 500-502. A petitioner seeking to challenge a special
assessment bears the burden of presenting credible evidence to rebut the presumption that the
assessments are valid. Kane v. Williamstown Wp., 301 Mich.App. 582 (2013). Speci?cally, the
petitioner must demonstrate ?a substantial and unreasonable disproportionality between the
amount assessed and the value that accrues to the land as a result of the improvements.? Dixon Rd
Group v. City of Novi, 426 Mich. 390 (1986); Storm v. City of Wyoming, 208 Mich.App. 45 (1994).
Without credible evidence to rebut the presumption of the assessment's validity, the Michigan Tax
Tribunal ?has no basis to strike down a special assessment.? Kadzban, 442 Mich. at 505.
Additionally, to protect private property rights, Michigan law also requires that the total amount
of the assessment must be no greater than what was reasonably necessary to cover the cost of the
work. Oneida v. Eaton C0. Drain Comm 198 Mich.App. 523 (1993).

In addition to a legal challenge against the special assessment, the Ordinance at Sec. 18-
12-141, Discontinuance of special assessment district through discontinuance petition, codi?es
MCL 117.51(2) whereby a SAD may be discontinued at any time via a discontinuance petition.

Therefore, a legal challenge to the Michigan Tax Tribunal or pursuit of a discontinuance
petition are the proper vehicles to impact a SAD levy once established. The City cannot forgive
or exempt a special assessment. The Treasurer may withhold a delinquent special assessment from
Wayne County but it remains a lien against the property and subject to collection action by the
City.7 Although this avenue is legal it should be carefully analyzed with the Of?ce of the Chief
Financial Of?cer to determine, at minimum, the following: 1) how withholding collection of a
SAD levy on individuals with hardship exemptions would shift that tax burden onto neighbors, 2)

 

7 If an individual were delinquent on their property taxes or water bill then it would still be referred to Wayne
County for collection.

Hon. City Council

Re: Economic Hardship Exemption in SADs
June 14, 2019

Page 8

  

 

how the fee for contracted services would be calculated without full participation, or 3) include a
mechanism to prohibit individuals with hardship exemptions from signing the petition to initiate a
SAD as they would not be participating in the payment for such services but would be receiving
the bene?ts unless the contractors hired were to ?skip? those households. Withholding special
assessment levies from return to Wayne County for those parcels with hardship exemptions could
create an administrative nightmare for the contractors hired to perform the services, the designated
neighborhood organization facilitating the SAD and the City administering departments as well.

 

Lastly, the current SAD Ordinance at Sec. 18-12-126(c) explicitly requires that ?each sheet
of the petition shall have below the table of signatures a place for certi?cation by the person
collecting the signatures of the Record Owners on that sheet, including the printed and signed
name of the collector and the date of certi?cation.?

CONCLUSION

The proposed ordinance amendment directly con?icts with the procedures set forth in state
law for the collection of unpaid special assessments. The 2012 Detroit City Charter, 1984 City
Code and General Property Tax Act expressly prohibit removing special assessments from the tax
roll. Therefore, Corporation Counsel is unable to approve the proposed ordinance amendment
drafted by LPD as to form as its enactment or enforcement is not supported by either the law or
relevant case law.

RE: Whether the City May Lawfully Enact an Ordinance Limiting the Availability
of Foreclosure as a Remedy in the Collection of Unpaid Assessments in a
Special Assessment District Created Pursuant to MCL 117.5i.

Your Honorable Body, through the Budget, Finance, and Audit Standing Committee, has
requested a legal opinion as to whether the City may enact an ordinance limiting the availability
of foreclosure as a remedy in the collection of unpaid assessments in a Special Assessment District
created under Chapter 18, Article XII of the 1984 Detroit City Codel. We are now responding to
this request.

SHORT ANSWER

Rules of preemption prohibit the city from enacting ordinances contrary to state law or the
city charter. The General Property Tax Act, 1893 PA 206, grants discretion to the City Treasurer
to include delinquent special assessments with. delinquent taxes returned to the Wayne County
Treasurer for collection. The 2012 Detroit City Charter states that delinquent special assessments
may be collected as delinquent city property taxes, and states that the city may use any procedure
and remedy for the collection of prOperty taxes. The proposed ordinance amendment drafted by
the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) represents an impermissible restraint on the powers of the
City Treasurer granted by state law and the City Charter and is therefore preempted.

BACKGROUND .

Section 51 of the Home Rule City Act, 1909 PA 279, MCL 117.51, authorizes
municipalities with a pOpulation of more than 600,000 to provide, by ordinance, a procedure to
?nance by special assessment certain activities, including private security services, snow removal,
and mosquito abatement. Pursuant to this delegation of authority, the City of Detroit enacted
Ordinance 07-14, effective June 9, 2014 and codi?ed at Section 18-12-120 et seq. of the Detroit
City Code. Consistent with state law and the city charter, Section 18-12-138 provides that a special
assessment is a lien on the property, is a debt due from the property owner, and may be collected
in the manner provided by state law, the city charter, and the city code. While the enabling statute

contains requirements for establishing and discontinuing the district, it is silent on the collection
of unpaid special assessments.

Concerns have been raised by members of Your Honorable Body regarding the desirability
of foreclosure as a remedy for unpaid special assessments.2 This resulted in a draft ordinance
prepared by Your Honorable Body?s Legislative Policy Division that would amend City Code
Section 18-12-138 to prohibit return of delinquent special assessments to the County Treasurer
imless there were also delinquent taxes on the same parcel. This opinion, submitted at the request
of the Budget, Finance and Audit Standing Committee, formalizes the concerns expressed by the
Lawr Department regarding. the legal effect of the proposed ordinance amendment.3

APPLICABLE LAW

Powers to enact ordinances

Although the City enjoys broad authority under the Home Rule City Act, 1909 PA 279,
CL 17.1 et seq, this authority is not without limits. The Michigan Constitution or state statutes
may constrain municipal authority. Article VII, {5 22 of the Michigan Constitution states, in part,
. . Each . . . city . . . shall have power to adopt resolutions and ordinances relating to its municipal
concerns, property and government, subject to the constitution and law'. . . Furthermore, Section
Sj of the Home Rule City Act states, in part: ?Each city in its charter may provide . . . (3) . .
through .its regularly constituted. authority to pass all laws and ordinances relating to its municipal
concerns subject to the constitution and general laws ofthis state.? MCL 117.5j. Thus, city charters
and ordinances are speci?cally subject to the general laws of the state.

 

 

The Michigan Supreme Court outlined. the constraints on a city?s power to enact ordinances
in Becky H?zomz'ng, 495 Mich 1, 19-20; 846 531 (2014):

Under the Michigan Constitution, the City?s ?power to adopt
resolutions and ordinances relating to its municipal concerns? is
?subject to the constitution and the law.? Genet 1963, art 7, 22. As

2014.

considerations either for or against the proposed ordinance.

this Court has previously noted, ?[w]hilc prescribing broad powers,
this provision speci?cally provides that ordinances are subject to
the laws of this state, ta, statutes.? AFSCME 12 Detroit, 468 Mich
388, 410; 662 695 (2003). The City, therefore, ?is
precluded from enacting an ordinance if . . . the ordinance is in
direct con?ict with the state statutory scheme, or . . . if the state
statutory scheme preempts the ordinance by occupying the field of
regulation which the municipality seeks to enter, to the exclusion of
the ordinance, even where there is no direct con?ict between the two
schemes of regulation.? People Llewellyn, 401 Mich 314, 322; 257
902 (1977).

(Emphasis added.)

In McNeil Charlevoix, 275 Mich App 686, 697 27 (2007), the Michigan Court of
Appeals de?ned direct con?ict as:

?For purposes of preemption, a direct conflict exists between a local
regulation and a state statute when the local regulation permits what
the statute prohibits or prohibits what the statute permits.?
(Emphasis added.)

See also Rental Property Owners Ass ?32 City omencl Rapids, 455 Mich 246, 566 
514 (1997), where the Michigan Supreme Court held that a local ordinance may add requirements
to a state regulatory scheme, so long as ?the municipality does not attempt to authorize by the
ordinance what the legislature has forbidden or forbid what the legislature has expressly
licensed, authorized, or required, . . (Emphasis added).

-- 

 

 

In the same way that a local ordinance may not be enacted that is contrary to state law, the
Michigan Supreme Court has determined mat a city may not validly enact an ordinance that
contradicts the express provisions of its charter. Bivens Grand Rapids, 443 Mich 391, 400; 505
239 (1993). Moreover, ordinances must conform to, be subordinate to, and neither con?ict
With nor exceed the charter. Id at 401.

ANALYSIS
Collection cf?l?axes and Special Assessments under State Law

The General Property Tax. Act (GPTA), 1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1, et sea, a general law
of the state, provides for the assessment, levying, and collection of property taxes. The City

Treasurer is mandated to collect taxes4 and follow the process and procedures set forth in the
GPTA.

Pursuant to MCL the Wayne County Treasurer .is the foreclosing
governmental unit and is responsible for the collection ozl?delinquent City ofDetrcit taxes.s Subject
to certain exceptions, the County Treasurer is required by law to foreclose on unpaid delinquent
taxes. MCL 211.78 through MCL 211.78m. Unpaid special assessments are included in the
de?nition of ?taxes? and collected pursuant to the procedures set forth in the GPTA for the
collection of delinquent property taxes.? Furthermore, MCL 211.55 grants the City Treasurer
discretion in returning special assessments to Wayne County for collection:

A township treasurer or other collecting officer may include as a
delinquent tax any unpaid special assessment which is delinquent on
the last day of February in the delinquent taxes returned to the
county treasurer the next day pursuant to this section. A delinquent
special assessment included as a delinquent tax pursuant to this
section shall, after return to the county treasurer, be a valid tax for
all purposes under this act.

(Emphasis Added.)

Thus, the state legislature has specifically authorized the City Treasurer as the city?s
collection of?cer7 to use his or her discretion to include delinquent special assessments with
delinquentproperty taxes returned to the County Treasurer. The proposed ordinance amendment
.is preempted by state law because it directly con?icts with the procedure set forth in state law for
the collection of unpaid special assessments by prohibiting What the state legislature has
speci?cally authorized.

 

eats?under the Git-y- Charter

 

4 MCL MCL 211.8%

5 Prior to 2003, the City of Detroit was responsible for collecting its own delinquent taxes. Public Act 246
of 2003 amended the General Property Tax Act to require the City of Detroit to collect all property taxes
(state, county and city) levied after December 31, 2003, and to return all uncollected delinquent taxes to
Wayne County for collection.

?5 MCL provides that used in section 73, this section, and sections 78b to 79a, ?taxes?
includes interest, penalties, and fees imposed before the taxes become delinquent and unpaid special
assessments or other assessments that are due and payable up to and including the date of the foreclosure
hearing under section 78k.? (Emphasis added.)

7 City Charter Section 6-3 05.

 

Honorable City Council

Ordinance purporting to prohibit foreclosure of delinquent special assessments
Page 5

February 23, 2015

 

 

City Charter Section 6-305 mandates that the City Treasurer collect all moneys of the city.
This ?duciary duty extends to custody and control of all money, funds and security of the city.

In accordance with Section 8-604 of the 2012 Detroit City Charter, a special assessment is
a lien on the property subject to the assessment, and a debt of the person assessed until paid. The
same section of the Charter permits delinquent special assessments to be collected by the
Treasurer, at his/her discretion, as delinquent city property taxes, which is consistent with the
provisions in the General Property Tax Act outlined above:

See. 8-604. - Assessment Lien.

From the date of con?rmation of any roll levying any special
assessment, the full amount of the assessment and all interest
thereon shall constitute a lien on the property subject thereto and
that amount shall also be a debt of the person to whom assessed until
paid and, in case of delinquency, may be collected as delinquent city
preperty taxes.

(Emphasis Added. 

Property taxation and collection matters, including the foreclosure of liens, are outlined in
Section 8?403 of the Charter which provides, in relevant part, that:
Sec. 8-403. - Collection of Property Taxes.

1. Except as otheiwise provided by this Charter or ordinance,
the rights, duties, powers, and immunities established by state law
shall apply in the collection and enforcement of city property taxes.

2. City property taxes shall become a debt of the persons liable

 

?fer?t?hom?on become-payable,

 

and a lien upon the property, on the ?rst (1 st) day of the city?s ?scal
year or such other date as may be provided by ordinance.



7. In addition to the other remedies specified in this section, at
the time unpaid city property taxes become delinquent or at any later
time permitted by law, the city may maintain a personal action
against the debtor for collection of the unpaid property taxes and
may use any means permitted by law for collection of the debt.
The City of Detroit tax roll shall be prima facie evidence of the
amount of the indebtedness .to the City of Detroit. The preceding
sections of 8403 are not the exclusive remedies of the City of
Detroit.

8. In addition to the procedures and remedies for the collection

and enforcement of the property taxes set forth in the Charter, the
city or other lienholcler may use any procedure and remedy for the
collection and enforcement of property taxes established by state

law.
(Emphasis added.)

Thus, the City Charter speci?cally permits delinquent special assessment payments to be
treated as delinquent taxes, and speci?cally grants the power to use any means permitted by law
for the collection of debt, and to use any procedure or remedy for collection of property taxes
established by state law. The proposed ordinance, which would restrict the options available to
the City Treasurer for collection of certain special assessments, is in direct con?ict with the City
Charter and is therefore preempted.

Comparison with Business Improvement Zone assessment remedies

Advocates for withholding foreclosure as a remedy cite the Principal Shepping Districts
and Business Improvement District statute, which specifically limits foreclosure-as an option for
delinquent special assessments in a Business Improvement Zone This reliance is
misplaced. as the remedies in the BIZ statute apply only to assessments levied pursuant to that
particular statute. It sets forth an alternative process for collecting delinquent assessments in a
BIZ and allows for the BIZ itself to collect delinquent assessments (those not paid within 90 days)
as well as the authority to pursue civil actions to collect.

The BIZ statute also allows unpaid assessments to either be a lien on the property the
BIZ may return the delinquent assessments to the City to be collected. Most importantly, the BIZ
statute expressly provides that delinquent assessments are subject to forfeiture, foreclosure or sale
cmlyiitlrepggperty also has $31}:on pmperty taxes. MCL 12539011. None of these provisions

 

are contained in the enabling statute for a SAD, however; therefore, none of the BIZ provisions
can be applied to the collection of unpaid special assessments in a SAD. While the model of the
BIZ may in many ways be considered superior to the SAD authorized by MCL 117.5i, .a BIZ
cannot be established for residential propertiesg. Accordingly, the BIZ model cannot be applied
to a SAD unless the legislature expands the concepts embodied in the BIZ statute to residential
properties, or adopts an analogous act for residential or neighborhood areas.

CONCLUSION
Enactment or enforcement of a Detroit ordinance that would control or limit the specific
powers conferred by the General Property Tax Act or the 2012 City Charter to the City Treasurer
relative to the collection of delinquent property taxes or delinquent special assessments would be
in direct con?ict with the statute and. the charter and therefore is preempted by state law.

?0 Role of Heard of" Assessors

The LPD draft ordinance amendment contains language prohibiting the ?Board of Assessors? from
returning unpaid special assessments to the County Treasurer. This appears to be in error as the Charter-
prescribed role of the Board of Assessors under Sec. 8402 is to prepare the tax roll and deliver it to the
Treasurer, who is responsible for collection of taxes and return of delinquent taxes to the County Treasurer.

 

THE GENERAL PROPERTY TAX ACT (EXCERPT)
Act 206 of 1893

211.89c Solid waste fee; treatment as delinquent; applicability of section; "solid waste fee"
defined.

Sec. 89c. (1) In any local tax collecting unit in a city with a population of 600,000 or more, the local tax
collecting unit may treat as delinquent under sections 87b, 87c, and 87d a solid waste fee that is delinquent
under the terms of any ordinance authorizing the solid waste fee, if that solid waste fee was included in the tax
statement under section 44.

(2) If a solid waste fee is delinquent on the March 1 immediately preceding the date that the solid waste fee
is returned as delinquent to the county treasurer under subsection (1), a county treasurer may include that
solid waste fee in the county's delinquent tax revolving fund.

(3) If a solid waste fee is returned to a county treasurer as delinquent under subsection (2), that solid waste
fee shall be a fee treated as a delinquent tax for purposes of sections 87b, 87c, and 87d and the property on
which the fee is assessed is subject to forfeiture, foreclosure, and sale for delinquent taxes as provided in this
act if the local tax collecting unit has also returned to that county treasurer uncollected delinquent taxes levied
on the property on which the solid waste fee is assessed.

(4) If an owner redeems property that is his or her principal residence that is returned to the county
treasurer for delinquent taxes and a delinquent solid waste fee is assessed to that owner's principal residence,
the owner may redeem his or her principal residence without payment of the delinquent solid waste fee. As
used in this subsection, principal residence means property exempt under section 7cc.

(5) This section applies to any fee that was delinquent on or after March 1, 2007 and that was included in
the delinquent tax roll delivered to a county treasurer at the same time as delinquent taxes for a year in which
the fee is assessed.

(6) As used in this section, "solid waste fee" means that term as de?ned in the ordinance or resolution of
the local tax collecting unit authorizing the assessment of the solid waste fee and includes all interest,
penalties, and fees imposed on that solid waste fee.

FROM: David D. Whitaker, Director 
Legislative Policy Division taf
DATE: June 14, 2019
RE: Special Assessment Districts Petitions

The Legislative Policy Division was requested to provide a report regarding the concerns
raised before City Council on June 4th and 11th alleging the petitions circulated by the designated
neighborhood improvement organization (DNIO) for the proposed Special Assessment District
(SAD) for University District were defective and not in compliance with the requirements as set
forth in the City?s SAD ordinance. LPD has obtained copies for several of the petitions for review
and has determined the validity of the allegations. A sample has been attached for your review.

The SAD ordinance under Subdivision B, Petition, sets forth the requirements for the
petitions. Pursuant to Sec. 18-12-125, the ordinance a DNIO may sponsor a petition for a SAD.
The petitions shall be prepared in accordance with the following provisions:

Section 18-12-126 Form of petition; information to be provided with petition.

The administering department shall prepare a form of petition to be used
to initiate a SAD described in this division and shall make the form available upon
request to any certi?ed DNIO. The form of petition shall provide for the inclusion
of all of the following information at the top of each sheet:

(1) The name and address of the DNIO associated with the petition
and contact information for one or more DNIO representatives.

(2) A description of the geographic boundaries of the proposed SAD.

(3) A description of the services to be funded by special assessment.

(4) A preliminary estimate of the assessed cost for the services
described in paragraph The estimate shall be based in part on the 
acquisition of three (3) estimates of the costs of providing the Services to be paid
by special assessment. Such estimates shall be from contractors licensed to
conduct business in the City of Detroit under all applicable laws.

(5) The estimated tax parcel share for the services to be provided
within the proposed SAD. The petition shall state that the estimated tax parcel
share may change after a record owner signs the petition and that any such change
shall not impact the validity of the petition, although a hearing may be required
pursuant to section during the term of a SAD as a result of such a
change.

(6) The proposed term of the SAD.

The remainder of each sheet of the petition shall contain a table with
columns for tax parcel, record owner, record owner's signature, and the date of
such signature. The petition form may contain blank underlined spaces for rows
of data for each column, or the petition may be prepared with the data for tax
parcel and record owner pre-printed on the petition form and blank underlined
spaces for the signature and date.

(0) Each sheet of the petition shall have below the table of signatures a place
for certi?cation by the person collecting the signatures of the record owners on
that sheet, including the printed and signed name of the collector and the date of
certi?cation.

To prepare the form of petition described in subsection for circulation,
a DNIO may request from the board of assessors or any other applicable City
agency or department, as needed, the following information:

(1) A listing of all tax parcels, with ward and item numbers, within the
geographic boundaries of the proposed SAD, the record owner of each tax parcel,
and the area in square feet of each tax parcel.

(2) Identi?cation of each tax parcel that would be exempt from
assessment pursuant to section 18-12-136.

The DNIO shall be responsible for circulating the petition to the record
owners within the proposed SAD and submitting the completed petition to the
city clerk in accordance with the following section. Prior to circulating an
unsigned petition, a DNIO shall submit it to the administering department for
approval as to its form and content. If the administering department denies the
form and content of the unsigned petition, it shall specify any deficiencies. The
DNIO shall then have the opportunity to cure any such deficiencies and resubmit
the unsigned petition for approval.

The petitions as drafted fail to meet ?ve of the six criteria set forth in Sec. The
petitions do not describe the geographic boundaries or the services to be funded, identify the
preliminary estimate of the assessed cost of services or the estimated tax parcel share for services
nor does it state the proposed term of the SAD. The Assessor?s Of?ce, as the administering
department, needs to recreate the form petition itself so that it comports with the SAD ordinance
before it can be utilized by any DNIO to create a SAD.

Additional allegations were made that some of the signatures were not valid because the
petitions were not signed, i.e.certitied. by the petition circulator. LPD, in a previous report,
erroneously indicated no such a requirement existed under the Detroit City Code. That
requirement can be found in Sec. 18-12-126tc]. Therefore. given the defective nature of the
petitions submitted for City Council?s consideration, your l-lonorable Body should not vote on this
matter until such time that the defects are cured.I

If there are any additional questions or concerns, please advise.

 

1 LPD was informed that the DNIO is withdrawing its petition for creation of the SAD, indicating its intention to redo
the petition process so that all concerns with the petitions can be addressed. So, before the DNIO reengages the
community members, the Assessor?s Of?ce should recreate the petitions in accordance with the SAD ordinance.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: AUTHORIZATION TO AMEND THE Y2018?l9 BUDGET FOR THE DETROIT
PUBLIC LIBRARY

The Detroit Public Library (DPL) is requesting authorization to amend its Fiscal Year 2018-19 Adopted
Budget to increase projected revenues and offsetting appropriation by $536,000. The current budget total
appropriation is $32,372,470.

At its May 21, 2019 meeting the Detroit Library Commission approved the budget amendment for capital
outlay. The Library will increase total expense by $536,000. During FY2018, the Skillman Branch
incurred major water damage. The total cost incurred was $636,000 which was covered by insurance.
After the $100,000 deductible, the Library received $536,000 in FY2018 from the insurance company to

Aggraval of Budget Amendment for Capital Outlay

During the FY2019 Budget process, the Commission approved a Capital Outlay budget
line item of $930,822 to cover renovation costs of Franklin and Jefferson branches,
Hubbard branch new HVAC system, and to purchase a new Mobile Library
(Bookmobile). During FY2018, the Skillman Branch incurred major water damage. The
total cost incurred was $636,000 which was covered by insurance. After the $100,000
deductible, the Library received $536,000 in FY2018 from the insurance company to
pay for the repairs. Due to a timing issue within the accounting rules, the expenditures
incurred for the repairs were not recorded until FY2019 and the revenue received from
the insurance company was placed into fund balance.

Administration is requesting approval to amend the FY2019 budget; to decrease fund

balance by $536,000 and to increase the Capital Outlay line item by $536,000. The
increase is needed to pay for the remaining expenditures for the Mobile Library and
planned renovations at the Jefferson branch.
