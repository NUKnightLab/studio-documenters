PROJECTS

Detroit Galley, LLC Casino Loan Program National Retail

Ms. Hundley advised that in March 2018, Pittsburgh-based Galley Group, Inc. ("Galley")
announced that it planned to open a food hall in restaurant incubator in a vacant space on
the ground floor of the Federal Reserve Building in the city's downtown. Galley launched

its first location in 2015 at Smallman Galley and Detroit Galley will be its
fourth location. Detroit Galley has approached EDC for financial assistance under the

September 25, 2018

500 Griswold, Suite 2200 Detroit, Michigon 48226 (313) 963-2940

Casino Loan program designed for National Retail Chains. Financing is being requested
to assist in the buildout and purchase of fixtures, furniture and equipment. EDC will partner
in financing with invest Detroit.

Galley, a food hall development, management and advisory company, partners with
community leaders and industry veterans to create a collaborative space to showcase up
to four innovative food service concepts. Galley creates launch pads for the best new
chef?driven restaurant concepts. The concept was driven by an assessment of the
industry revealing a lack of business and management experience, significant waste,
inability to control cost and the inability to manage front of house and back of house
responsibilities. They provide the infrastructure for chefs to bring their concepts to market
at low-risk and for low-costs.

Galley derives its revenue from food beverage sales and event fees. The sales forecast
for Detroit Galley projects 35% food, 58% beverage and 7% events. The ?rst full year of
operations projects income of 3M. Currently, a November 2018 soft opening date is
planned. Detroit Galley will finance and manage the build out of the space, utilities, and
the marketing and the Detroit location will be operated by Detroit Galley LLC (?Detroit
Galley"), a sole member LLC owned by Galley. Galley?s shareholders include Galley
Group Holdings, LLC (which is wholly owned by Cornwall Capital Management LP)

Small Business and Commercial Corridor Revitalization Program: Community
Development Block Grant Consultant Services

Ms. Pledl reported that the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) of the City of
Detroit currently administers the Motor City Match and Motor City Re-Store programs (the
?Programs?) to revitalize Detroit?s commercial corridors and grow neighborhood business
investment using Community Development Block Grant funds from the City of
Detroit pursuant to a subreciplent agreement with the City.

The EDC had previously approved a professional services agreement to provide CDBG
consultant services for the Programs and it was determined that it was necessary to re?
bid for the CDBG consultant services. On August 20, 2018, the EDC solicited bid
proposals for CDBG consultant services for the services described in Exhibit A attached
to the memorandum for the small business development and commercial corridor
revitalization programs, for a period of one (1) year, with the ability to renew for up to two
(2) additional one-year periods. The basis for EDC contract awards were based on federal
procurement policies set forth in 24 CFR 85.36.

EDC staff received one (1) proposal to the solicitation and questions from a second
company that did not ultimately submit a proposal. Staff has reviewed the proposal from
Hennessey Engineers, Inc. (?Hennessey?) and recommends Hennessey to provide the
Work. Hennessey brings over 40 years of experience and knowledge of municipal federal
program management. Highlights include Hennessey?s leadership role in managing
Wayne County?s CDBG program. for 34 communities and 5 non-pro?ts. They managed
over 200 projects yearly from eligibility to reporting and administered the program for
50% of the allowed administrative cost while increasing spending by 50%. Hennessey is
currently working with the City of Detroit to form the new Office of Grants Management,
which involves creating centralized management, monitoring and reporting of all the City's
grants to increase transparency and efficiency of spending. Hennessey has provided
excellent comprehensive CDBG consultant services for the EDC small business
programs.

The EDC staff requests authorization from the Board to enter into a Professional Services
Agreement between Firm and EDC in an amount that will not~to~exceed One Hundred
Thousand and 00/ 100 

A resolution was included with the board material for your review and approval.

Subsequent to a discussion, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Jackson, seconded by Mr. Osei, Resolution Code EDC 18?
09-91?72 was unanimously approved.

Small Business and Commercial Corridor Revitalization Program: Business
Planning and Financial Planning Services 

Mr. Batten stated that as the Board is aware, the Economic Development Corporation
(EDC) of the City of Detroit currently administers programs, including Motor City Match, to
revitalize Detroit?s commercial corridors and grow neighborhood business investment
using Community Development Block Grant funds from the City of Detroit.

September 25, 2018

The EDC solicited bid proposals on June 19, 2018, for business planning services as the
basis for ?Business Plan ?awards for Motor City Match and for financial planning services
to assist awardees of the ?Design? and ?Cash? award tracks.

EDC staff received seven (7) proposals to the RFP solicited on June 19, 2018.
Respondents included Best Practices Consulting Services, BUILD institute, Diane Walker,
LLC, LifeLine Business Consulting Services, LLC, QT Business Soiutions, The PLLUS
Group, and Tiva Capital. Staff desires to contract with four (4) business pianning service
providers and two (2) financial planning service providers. The business planning
providers are Best Practices Consulting Services, BUILD institute, Diane Walker, LLC,
and LifeLine Business Consulting Services, LLC, The financiai pianning service providers
are LifeLine Business Consulting Services, LLC and Tiva Capitai.

These six (6) providers were both the most quaiified and the most responsive; further,
these providers wilt provide Motor City Match awardees with the best choices in business
and financial planning education and meet the need of educating more than two hundred
fifty (250) entrepreneurs per year on the basics of both deveIOping a business plan and
financial planning services.

The EDC staff requested authorization from the Board to enter into Professionai Services
Agreements, each for a term of one-year, with an option to extend for one-year, for
business pianning services with the providers, and in the amounts, set forth on Exhibit A
and for financial advisory services with the providers, and in the amounts, set forth on
Exhibit B, which were inciuded in the Board material, along with a proposed resolution.

Mr. Jackson stated that these two services are invaluable to the Motor City Match
Program.

Mr. Batten explained how the consultants help someone that has a business idea decide
if it is a good idea for the area and make a decision sooner whether to move forward with
theidea.

Ms. Bruhn asked for an explanation in differences of the cost of the contracts, which range
from $25,200 to $10,862. Mr. Batton stated that he wouid get back to the Board with that
information.

Ms. Ciayson asked if the awardees get to choose the courses that they take. Mr. Batton
responded yes. Ms. Clayson requested a copy of the description of the courses offered.

Subsequent to the discussion, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Jackson, seconded by Mr. Osei, Resoiution Code EDC 18-
09-91-73 was unanimousiy approved.

September 25, 2018


Report of Actions Taken Under Delegation of Authority

Ms. Jensen reviewed the August report of actions taken by staff under the Delegation of
Authority resolution.

Mr. Jackson asked if the Grow Detroit Young Talent Program would continue next year.
Ms. Jensen stated that the program was fairly successful, and they would like to see it
continue next year. Ms. Navin added that there were some philanthropic grant funds
allocated to the Motor City Match Program that were not used for the intended purpose,
and we had to ask the funder for permission to reprogram the funds for this use. So we
will have to look to see what source of funds we could use for continuing the program. Mr.
Osei questioned what the minimum dollar amount per hour the students receive in the
Grow Detroit Young Talent program. Ms. Jenson responded that we will get back to the
Board with that information.

OTHER MATTERS

Ms. Jenson informed that Flex?n?Gate will be hosting their ribbon cutting ceremony on
October 8 from 1:00 -- 2:00 pm. and extended an invitation to the Board members. We
are quite excited that the project is at this point. When we initially started working with
Fiex-n-Gate, the estimated investment amount was $95 miliion. They are up to about
$160 million because they increased the machinery and equipment. It also is great that
they have really focused on hiring Detroit residents.

Mr. Jackson questioned how the community benefits ordinance works when a project
starts off under the dollar threshold and then the investment increases. Ms. Navin
responded that the abatements for Flown-Gate were approved prior to the enactment of
the CBO. They went through an informal community engagement process that wasn?t
mandated by the ordinance, had the ordinance been in piece. With respect to projects
that increase, we need to discuss that with the City and how they are approaching that.
Ultimately it is the City that is responsible for interpreting and enforcing the CBO.

PUBLIC COMMENT
ADJOURNMENT

With there being no further business to come before the Board, Mr. Queries adjourned the
meeting at 9:09 am.
