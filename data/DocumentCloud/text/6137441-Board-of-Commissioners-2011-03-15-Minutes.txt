 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 15, 2011
Resolution and Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2011
WHEREAS, on February 29, 2008, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved an
Ordinance establishing the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (“Enabling
Ordinance”); and
WHEREAS, Section 38-83 of the Enabling Ordinance provides the following with regard to
the County Board’s approval of the Health System’s Preliminary Budget:
WHEREAS, consistent with the powers and responsibilities granted to the Health System
Board by the County Board in the Enabling Ordinance, the Health System wishes to operate
under an enterprise fund model allowing the Health System Board through the Health
System’s Chief Executive Officer to have authority over the expenditure of funds allocated to
the Health System by the County Board, and to be exempt from any limitations on funds
appropriated to the 100 accounts in the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill;
and
WHEREAS, Section 38-83 of the Enabling Ordinance further provides that after approval of
each Annual Appropriation Ordinance, the Health System Board has the authority to make
intra-fund transfers within the Health Fund, if necessary, to accommodate any proposed
revisions by the Health System Board to the line items set forth in the Annual Appropriation
Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for FY 2010 provided
that the Health System is exempt from the provision that all funds appropriated to any
account or sub-account within Category 100 (Personal Services) shall remain fixed and

subject to transfer to any impersonal account, or to any line item other than those within the
100 Series, as listed in the Chart of Accounts; and
WHEREAS, both the Health System Board and the County Board approved a Master Lease
Agreement for the Health System, and the Health System Board subsequently approved a
replacement Master Lease Agreement for the Health System expanding the time frame for the
Agreement, which authorizes the Health System to lease capital equipment through an
operating lease as opposed to acquisition through financing by a bond issuance by the
County; and
WHEREAS, the Health System wishes to lease capital equipment for 2011 through its Master
Lease Agreement, and inasmuch as this action may occur prior to the issuance of a bond by
the County, the Health System wishes to be exempt from any temporary “budget holds” that
might occur at the County level pending discussion and approval of bond issuance for certain
purchases of capital equipment; and
WHEREAS, the Health System receives funds from various granting agencies and wishes to
continue to approve new grants, renewals or amendments to existing grants and receive these
grant funds without further approval by the County Board; and
WHEREAS, on November 19, 2010, the Health System’s Board of Directors approved the
Health System’s Fiscal Year 2011 Preliminary Budget.

65

1.

Consistent with the Health System Board’s authority to make intra-fund

Services), notwithstanding any limitations on funds appropriated to the 100
accounts in the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for
Fiscal Year 2011.

2.

Year 2011 through the Master Lease Agreement notwithstanding any

amendments to existing grants and receive grant funds without further
County Board approval, notwithstanding any limitations on this authority in
the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2011.

This Resolution shall be in full force and effect immediately upon
passage by the Cook County Board of Commissioners.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 12/14/10. It is requested that this matter be

CONTRACTS
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 10, 2011 from
ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
and
PATRICK T. DRISCOLL, JR., Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, State’s Attorney’s Office
Re: Countywide Debt Collection Contract – New Item March 15, 2011 Board Agenda
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Harris & Harris Ltd.,
Chicago, Illinois, for Countywide Debt Collection Services. They will provide comprehensive debt
collection services on outstanding accounts, which have been classified as uncollectible by the various
County agencies.
Reason:

The Countywide Debt Collection Service initiative was led by the Office of the State's
Attorney and Department of Revenue, which formed a Countywide Committee that included
Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, Cook County Health and Hospitals System, Office of
the Sheriff, Office of the County Clerk, Bureau of Administration and Bureau of Finance. A
Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued for these services via the Cook County website. The
committee recommends Harris & Harris, Ltd. after conducting a comprehensive and objective
evaluation of all the proposals submitted based on meeting the conditions listed in the RFP,
overall presentation, responses to clarification and follow up questions and pricing.
Harris & Harris has met the qualifications and has the experience to perform the services
requested through the use of best in class debt collection technology, robust training
programs for their associates, competitive contingency rate, and experience with clients that
are similar in size, nature and demographic of Cook County including health and hospital
systems.
The Countywide committee recommends two agencies instead of one to perform debt
collection for the entire County to ensure adequate coverage to handle the full volume of
work, healthy competition between the contracted vendors, and best practice at other leading
governmental organizations which ultimately results into increased revenue collection.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. (Contingency Fee Basis All County Agencies Year 1 - 17.25%, Year 2 17.25%, Year 3 - 17.25%.) Contract period: March 16, 2011 through March 15, 2014.
