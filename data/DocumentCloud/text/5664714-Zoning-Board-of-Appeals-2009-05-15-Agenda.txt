Premises affected - 4530 N. Hermitage Avenue
Subject Appeal from the decision of the Office of the Zoning Administrator in refusing to allow a
principal residence (the front building) to be demolished and then rebuilt in an RS-3 Residential
Single-Unit (Detached House) District. There are two residential buildings on one zoning lot.
There is a 3 dwelling unit building at the front of the lot and a 1 dwelling unit building with 2
parking spaces at the rear of the lot. The Zoning Administrator states if the front building is
demolished, the rear building becomes a principal use detached building. Section 17-1-1300
states no more than one principal use detached residential building may be located on a zoning
lot and a principal detached residential building may not be located on a zoning lot that contains
any other principal building. Section 17-15-0304-B states when a structure containing a nonconforming use (here 3 dwelling units) is intentionally damaged (demolition) by causes within
the control of the owner, re-establishment of the non-conforming use is prohibited. The new
house will also not have parking.
