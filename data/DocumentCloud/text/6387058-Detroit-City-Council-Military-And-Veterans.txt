Submitting report relative to Review of the 2018 Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR) for the City of Detroit. (Plante & Moran, PLLC, the
City’s independent auditor, issued an unqualified (“clean”) opinion for the
2018 CAFR, including its audited financial statements and related footnotes.
A clean opinion does not mean that the City’s financial condition is
satisfactory. Essentially a “clean” opinion means that the City’s 2018 CAFR
is fairly presented in all material aspects. As a result, investors, creditors,
rating agencies and other interested parties reading the City’s 2018 CAFR
can rely on the audited financial statements and the information contained
therein.)
