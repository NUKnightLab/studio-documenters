PROPOSED RESOLUTION
TO ESTABLISH THE LEAD POISONfNG PREVENTION FUND
Whereas, PA 90-778 authorizes the County Board to determine that funds in excess of the amount
needed to satisfy claims against the Torrens Indemnity Fund exist in the Torrens Indemnity Fund, and
further authorizes the County Board to establish a Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund with such excess
funds; and
Whereas, to determine whether excess funds exist, PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted an
actuarial study of the Torrens Indemnity Fund and issued a report dated October 19, 1999; and

2991

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 4, 2000
Whereas, the Pricewaterhouse Coopers report projects future claims against the Torrens
Indemnity Fund using severa l methodo logies, the most conservative of which, projects future exposure at
$6,556, 173 over the remaining life of the Torrens Fund which ends on July 1, 203 7; and
Whereas, the Pricewate rhouseCoopers re port finds that, as of November 30, 1998, the Torrens
Indemnity Fund had a balance of $35,0 I 1,503, deducting fo r claim reserves, an amount of approx imately
$28,000,000 could be detem1ined as excess of need; and
Whe reas, PA 90-778 provides that should the County Board determine that excess funds exist in
the Torrens Indemnity Fund , the Board may establish a Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund and transfer not
less than 50% of the excess monies to such fund; and
Whereas, PA90-778 provides that the princ ipal of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund be used to
provide financial assistance to owners of residential property within the county to pay costs associated
with lead mitigation and lead abatement through loans, grants, or other assistance as the county deems
appropriate, and further that any interest which accrues on investment of the Fund ' s principal may
additionally be used to fund other lead poisoning prevention activities, such as education, community
outreach and other acti vities the county deems appropriate for prevention of lead poisoning; and
Whereas, establishment of an effecti ve countywide lead prevention program requires the advice
and counsel of community leaders and professionals.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COOK COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
THAT:
1.

Based upon the findings set fo rth in the PricewaterhouseCoopers actuaria l report, it is hereby
determined that $6,556, 173 should be retained by the Torrens Inde mnity Fund to satis fy claims
which may be brought over the remaining life of the Fund which expires July 1, 2037, and that
the balance of the Torrens Indemnity Fund as of November 30, 1998, of $28,455 ,330 be deemed
in excess of the needs of the Torrens Indemni ty Fund.

2.

A Lead Po isoning Prevention Fund be established in accordance with PA 90-778, and that
$ 14,227,665 be transferred as the opening principal amount of the Lead Po isoning Preve ntion
Fund. In addition to the principal amount, a ll inte rest earnings which have accrued on such
amount from November 30, 1998 to date shal l also be transferred to the Lead Poisoning
Prevention Fund.

3.

After deductions fo r the Torrens c laim reserve amou nts and the Lead Po isoning Prevention Fund,
the remaining balances of the Torre ns Indemnity Fund shall be transferred to the County's
Gene ral Fund to be used as the County Board deems appropriate for purposes which benefit
owne rs of rea l property in the county in acco rdance w ith PA 90-778.

4.

The Pres ident of the Cook County Board of Comm issioners is authorized to establish a Lead
Prevention Program and a Lead Prevention Advisory Council. The members of the Council shall
advise the President on Program guidelines a nd make recomme ndations for funding lead
po isoning prevention activities to be funded by the Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Si lvestri, moved that the communication be

PROPOSED ORDINANCE

AN ORDINANCE TO DIRECT COOK COUNTY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A PLAN
TO REDUCE COUNTY WASTE THROUGH REUSE AND RECYCLING.
WHEREAS, Cook County recently evidenced its commitment to recycling by passing an ordinance
mandating the purchase of recycled products; and
WHEREAS, recycling saves energy and natural resources, and reduces the use of toxic chemicals in the
manufacturing process; and
WHEREAS, recycling at a 25% diversion rate would reduce the County's waste disposal costs by 25%;
and
WHEREAS, waste disposal is an enormous expense for municipal governments, costing the City of
Chicago alone $31.2 million; and
WHEREAS, seven landfills in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, representing 21 % of the region's capacity,
will close by the end of the year 2000, raising the cost of waste disposal still further; and
WHEREAS, the success of recycling programs depends on "closing the loop": collecting recyclable
products to create a supply of material, remanufacturing products, and purchasing recycled products to
create a market; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs reports that 600 firm s are
engaged in the business of recycling in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, Cook County can save money while reducing waste by reducing its use of materials and
reusing materials where feasible.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that Cook County develop and implement a plan to reduce
and reuse material, and to recycle material from all County fac ilities; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that such plan be calcu lated for the purpose of achieving a countywide goal of 25% waste diversion and an accompanying 25% waste disposal cost reduction.
