NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This is a request to accept a new grant award for the Healthy Start Initiative, Eliminating Racial/Ethnic Disparities.

The Cook County Healthy Start Initiative (CCHSI) project aims to help eliminate perinatal health disparities in Cook
County by providing case management support for African American women aged 20-35 at risk for poor birth
outcomes, along with their infants and father/partners in the targeted project area, urban communities within Cook
County, Illinois. The program will work to identify and recruit African American women into early and adequate
prenatal care, reduce the percentage of low birth weight and preterm infants, and link participants to the network of

services they need.

 
   
 

 
   
 

 
      
    

By strengthening CCH's prenatal health delivery system and establishing a new model of comprehensive prenatal

African American women that result in maternal and infant mortality, low-birth weight, and pre?term births.

From: James Kiamos, Chief Executive Officer, Managed Care
Re: 12-Month Purchase of Reinsurance for CountyCare Health Plan (MIMI-1213112019)

Since the inception of CountyCare, Cook County Health (CCH) has purchased reinsurance to
offset the risk of its high-cost members. Initially, reinsurance was focused only on members who
received transplant services. Beginning in 2015, general stop-loss reinsurance was secured with a
threshold of $750,000 per member. Claims costs incurred in excess of that amount are reimbursed
to CCH. Coverage is priced on a PMPM basis by population type FHP, SPD, ACA Adults).

The CCH policy is issued under a County-wide insurance brokerage contract with Alliance
Insurance Services, managed by the County's Of?ce of Risk Management.

CCH recommends entering a stop-loss policy coverage for twelve months, through December 31,
2019. Based on the bids submitted, and pricing and risk analysis, the recommended policy would
increase the per member reinsurance deductible from $750,000 to $1,000,000. Terms will include'

a $1,000,000 per member deductible

#1 90% reinsurance once deductible is met; $2 million maximum benefit

a Costs are calculated at 100% of Medicaid for non-CCH providers and at 29% of charges
(comparable to standard Medicaid rates) for services provided at CCH

- Blood factor products, blood derivatives and anti-inhibitor coagulant complex excluded for
certain members

This memo requests the Board?s approval of payment not to exceed $3,571,200 for the purchase
of re-insurance as described above for CountyCare members. The coverage will be provided by
Sequoia, as placed by Alliance Insurance Services, the County?s insurance broker.
