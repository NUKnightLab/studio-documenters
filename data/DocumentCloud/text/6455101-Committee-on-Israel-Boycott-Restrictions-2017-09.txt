Address updates
Chairman Goldberg reported that the committee was contacted by the Israel-American Coalition for
Action, who provided information relative to Danske Bank, previously on the Board’s list of restricted
entities, suggesting that the company is boycotting Israel within the meaning of the Illinois statute. The
activities identified by the Israel-American Coalition for Action included activities identified by the IIPB in
February of 2016, when it was initially placed on the Illinois list of restricted companies. A review of
Danske Bank’s public information confirmed the activity. After a discussion, the Committee voted (4-0;
by Mahoney, seconded by Atwood) to recommend that the IIPB identify Danske Bank as an entity
boycotting Israel, and to send a letter to same requesting a response. Goldberg also reported that ISS
confirmed it made a scrivener error as to identification of The Co-operative Group on its lists provided to
the IIPB which, as a result, was made on the website. That Committee voted (4-0; by Mahoney,
seconded by Atwood) to recommend to the IIPB that the website be corrected.
Other Business
The Committee then had a discussion regarding the vendor (IW Financial) acquisition by ISS (ISS-Ethix) in
January of 2017.
Next meeting Date
The committee will stand to the call of the chairman with no set meeting date.
Adjournment
At 11:45am the meeting adjourned. Motioned by Atwood, seconded by Oberman approved 4-0.
