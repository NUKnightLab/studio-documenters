Action Items
A. Presentation on proposed CCHHS FY2012 Preliminary Budget (Attachment #1)
B. Approval of CCHHS FY2012 Preliminary Budget, including presentation and consideration of any
amendments, pursuant to Section 38-83 of the Cook County Ordinance Establishing the Cook County
Health and Hospitals System (Attachment #2)
Director Carvalho reviewed the process to date for the deliberations regarding the proposed CCHHS FY2012
Preliminary Budget. He noted that the System Board has before them a budget that reflects the work to date;
this identifies the expenditures required to implement the vision with the efficiencies that have been
identified to date in dialogues, both internally and with the County Budget office.
Director Carvalho stated that the work will continue on this budget. Some relatively modest adjustments on
the expenditure side, and some increases on the revenue side, have been made, since the last meeting when
this was presented. The difference between those two, or the subsidy, goes down a little when costs are
reduced, and goes up a little when revenues are increased; this still does not result in a number that has been
publicly identified as the target, so the work will continue.
Director Carvalho stated that it was the sense of the administrative team and Chairman Batts and himself,
that what the Board wanted to see is a budget that is the best estimate of what is required to accomplish the
vision next year, with the revenues that are realistic expectations for next year, without going through any
artificial means to hit a target.
Following approval by the System Board, this product will be presented to the County Board’s Finance
Committee on Monday, October 3rd; approval by the County Board is expected to take place on Tuesday,
October 4th. Following this activity, it will go to the President for inclusion in her budget; the additional
work to make this fit into the entire budget of Cook County will then begin.

Action Items
B. Approval of CCHHS FY2012 Preliminary Budget (continued)
Dr. Terry Mason, System Interim Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Ayres, Consultant to the System
reviewed the presentation (Attachment #1) on the proposed CCHHS FY2012 Preliminary Budget. The
Board discussed the information.
Dr. Mason referenced a discussion held at the September 16th Special Board Meeting regarding the plan to
fund the vacant positions at 20%. He provided further information on the subject. With a 20% vacancy rate,
the salary line gets brought down $51,543,486. If it is funded at the 50% level, it would change that number
to $35,720,257.
Roz Lennon, System Chief Clinical Officer provided additional information regarding nursing positions.
She noted that she focused upon Stroger Hospital, as that is where the majority of positions are. The initial
request was for 366 new nursing positions. Management initially took out 213 between new and vacant
positions; funding that number of positions at 20%, takes it down to only 42.6 positions for next year.
The Board discussed the usage of registry nurses and overtime. Additionally, Ms. Lennon stated that there is
an additional $2.5 million appropriated for the nursing float pool. The proposal for the float pool has been
presented, but the details have not yet been worked out with the unions. Also discussed were the following
subjects: the type of prioritizing with regard to vacancies and budget planning; and the number of vacant
positions (excluding nursing positions) that have been vacant for more than one year.
Director Ansell expressed his concerns with the plan to fund the vacant positions at 20%; he suggested that
these vacancies be funded instead at 50%. Additionally, he expressed concerns with the Ambulatory plan, as
Ambulatory is somewhat decreased in the budget. He noted that issues regarding staffing have been
presented to the Quality and Patient Safety Committee frequently this year; this impacts productivity.
Director Ansell moved to fund the vacancy rate at 50%. The motion died due to
lack of a second.
Director Ansell, seconded by Vice Chairman Ramirez, moved that management
re-examine the vacancy rate and adjust it in order to achieve a 50th percentile
benchmark target in nurse staffing.
Director Ansell noted that, by not specifying a vacancy rate percentage amount, this will allow management
the flexibility to carry this out; he added that nursing is a critical area, but it is not the only critical area in the
System.
Director Golden inquired whether the intent is for this to only apply to nursing positions. Director Ansell
responded that his intent is for it to cover positions within the broad nursing continuum.
On the motion, a voice vote was taken and THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Batts and Director Butler voted NO.

 COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
RESOLUTION

Sponsored by Director David A. Ansell, MD, MPH
WHEREAS, there are unacceptably high waiting lists for basic services within the Cook County Health
and Hospitals System; and
WHEREAS, these wait lists if not shortened can lead to premature morbidity and mortality for the
population the Health System serves; and
WHEREAS, I move that this board in conjunction with the leadership of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System direct funds from this year's budget:

To eliminate the wait list for colonoscopy, the wait list for trans-rectal prostate biopsies, diagnostic
mammograms, eye clinic and other critical services as determined by management.
In addition, the Board directs the Health System to expand screening mammography within the Health
System to be able to accommodate the screening needs of the women, who receive their primary care
within the System; and
To report back to the Board on progress towards these goals on a quarterly basis. It is the spirit of this
resolution that substantial progress toward eliminating these wait lists and expanding screening
mammography occur this fiscal year.
Finally, in order to achieve this goal of improving health, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Board requests that the Cook County Board of Commissioners find the necessary new revenues to
enable the Cook County Health and Hospitals System to fulfill its mission and end the wait lists that
contribute to ill health.
Approved as amended, and adopted this 28th day of September, 2011.
