Mr. Rawls called for approval of the minutes of the June 8, 2016 DBRA-CAC meeting.
The Committee took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. Choske, seconded by Mr. George, DBRA-CAC Resolution
Code 16-10-02-119, approving the June 8, 2016 CAC minutes, was unanimously

Projects
St. Charles School Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the St. Charles School Brownfield Redevelopment Plan. A
PowerPoint presentation provided renderings and maps. Mr. Vosburg responded to CAC
a member question regarding TIF and the developer responded to CAC member
questions regarding the architect, salvaging the school materials, the floor plan, rental
rates, security features, community engagement, green building features and mitigating
lead exposure to those nearby during the redevelopment of the school.
Project Introduction
FSI 4, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails the
rehabilitation of the vacant former St. Charles School, which is next door to St. Charles
Borromeo Catholic Church, into a 27-unit loft-style rental building which will include a new
construction fourth floor. A new construction 11-unit two-story townhome building will be
built directly to the south of the school building on what are four vacant lots. One, two
and three bedroom units will be created, with 8 of the 11 new construction townhomes
reserved as affordable units for renters with incomes below 80% of the area median
income (AMI). The parking areas of the development will be located away from the street
view and have green storm water features.
Approximately 5 permanent full time equivalent jobs and 100 temporary construction jobs
are expected to be created as a result of the project. The total investment is estimated
to exceed $8.3 million. The Developer is requesting $851,295 in TIF reimbursement.

 Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) is located at 1432-1454 Townsend Street, five
parcels on the eastside of Townsend Street between St. Paul and Agnes Streets in the
Islandview Village neighborhood of Detroit, just east of East Grand Boulevard and just
north of East Jefferson Avenue near Belle Isle.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized for a commercial and/or residential purpose; (b) it
is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and
(c) the Property is determined to be functionally obsolete, blighted and/or adjacent to or
contiguous to an eligible parcel and is estimated to increase the captured taxable value
of that property as defined by Act 381. 1454 Townsend, the former school building, has
been certified functionally obsolete by a level 3 or level 4 assessor, a letter to that effect
can be found in Attachment D of the Plan. The three vacant lots identified as 1432, 1438
and 1444 Townsend are owned by the Detroit Land Bank Authority and thus automatically
qualify as blighted per Act 381, the initial determination of blight letter is pending from
Detroit City Planning Commission staff. The parcel identified as 1450 Townsend is
adjacent and contiguous to eligible parcels at 1444 and 1454 Townsend Street.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, infrastructure
improvements, site preparation, and development and preparation of a brownfield plan
and/or work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the
development of the Property and will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority
is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The eligible
activities are estimated to begin in fall/winter of 2016 and complete within eighteen (18)
months.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

governed by the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Other Development Incentives
The Developer of this Plan will seek additional support through a Commercial
Rehabilitation Act Abatement (PA 210).
Attached for review and approval were three (3) resolutions: 1.) a resolution supporting
the Plan Amendment in the event the Committee does not deem it necessary to conduct
a CAC public hearing and 2.) a resolution authorizing a public hearing in the project area
and 3.) a resolution authorizing a public hearing in the project area and to appoint up to
two special CAC members. The public hearing may be held jointly with any public hearing
conducted by the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority.
Ms. Stahl asked what the difference was in holding off recommendation until after the
public hearing, Ms. Kanalos clarified that in the event, there would need to be another
CAC meeting held directly after to vote on the project.
Mr. Rawls called for a motion recommending the St. Charles School Brownfield
Redevelopment Plan.
Mr. George motioned to recommend approval of the St. Charles School Brownfield
Redevelopment Plan without a CAC public hearing and without appointing special
members. Mr. Hill seconded the motion. DBRA-CAC Resolution Code 16-06-24101, recommending approval of the St. Charles School Brownfield Redevelopment
Plan, was unanimously approved.
Other Matters
Mr. Rawls introduced Brad Lutz, who was recently appointed to the CAC. Mr. Lutz briefly
addressed the CAC.
Ms. Stahl asked DBRA staff regarding the Senate Bills 1061-1065. DBRA staff provided
additional information with respect to the bills.
Public Comment
None

 Adjournment
Citing no further business, Mr. Rawls called for a motion to adjourn. Mr. George motioned
to adjourn the meeting. Mr. Hill seconded the motion and it was unanimously approved
