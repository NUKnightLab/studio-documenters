At approximately 10:30 a.m. Commissioner Ivers announced his departure from the meeting in

summer of 2008, the CHA tasked the Prime Design Consultant, CSA Great Lakes to perform a
visual assessment of the facade at Caroline Hedger Apartments. The facade inspection task order
proposal called for visual inspection from the ground, rooftops, balconies, and contractor's
equipment. Contractor's equipment has only become available since the commencement of
construction, permitting close range inspection and discovery of conditions not visible from the
ground with binoculars. Based on the initial inspections of the south and west elevations of the
building from the Contractor's swing stage, the PDC has found additional quantities of slab edge
removal and replacement along with additional quantities of column and wall removal. The
additional quantities have been determined to be approximately 705 linear feet and 1,322 square
feet at $225.00 per linear or square foot.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-105
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 12,
2009 entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE MODIFICATION NO. G-01
TO CONTRACT NO. 9012 WITH JSL MASONRY RESTORATION, INC. FOR
ADDITIONAL WORK RELATED TO THE EXTERIOR FACADE
RESTORATION OF CAROLINE HEDGER APARTMENTS (IL2-073)”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute Contract Modification No. G-01 to Contract No. 9012 with
JSL Masonry Restoration, Inc. in the not-to-exceed amount of $456,075.00 for
exterior façade restoration work at Caroline Hedger Apartments (IL2-073). The
new total contract amount of Contract No. 9012 is $2,209,772.00.
This Contract Modification is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the
CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

(Item B2)
Modification No. G-09 to contract with Friedlar Construction covers additional renovation work
at Cabrini in the amount of $312,763.00 to primarily cover sewer and grease basin work to
replace damaged sanitary lines and the removal of unsuitable sub-grade materials. The existing
sanitary lines were televised and found to be damaged in multiple locations. Upon receiving and
reviewing the video report the Prime Design Consultant directed the Contractor to perform all
replacement of existing sewer lines. The Contractor will also provide compacted fill material for
footings, concrete flatwork and backfill where unsuitable sub-grade materials are encountered as
determined by an independent testing agency. During the review of the sewer work staff
determined that this work needed to be started as quickly as possible in order to avoid delaying
other work which could negatively impact the ability to meet the CHA’s unit count at this
development. In addition, failure to repair the sewer lines could affect sanitation for the

 residents, causing a potential health hazard. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B2 ratifies
Modification No. G-09 with Friedlar Construction.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-106
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 12,

This Contract Modification is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the
CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

(Item B3)
The resolution for Item B3 approves submission of a Demolition Application to HUD for the
CHA property at 3600 S. Vincennes. The property is within the Madden/Wells Revitalization
Area, and is located on a site of approximately 18,000 square feet. The footprint of the former
church building and a later attached 3-story brick building has remained vacant with little or no
maintenance since the time it was purchased. There have been several fires at this site,
weakening the structure. The terra cotta section of the front entry has burned and collapsed. The
primary front wall stands alone with no support. The building is open to squatters and vandals.
Entire sections of the chain link fence have been stolen. Because of the deteriorated condition of
this building and the safety hazard it poses to passers by, it is in the Authority’s best interests to
demolish the structure.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-107
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 12,
2009, entitled “REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION TO SUBMIT A

(Item B4)
The resolution for Item B4 approves extension of contracts with MacGray Services, Family Pride
and Coinmach for the continued supply and maintenance of laundry room equipment at senior
buildings. The base term for the original contract with each vendor was five years, with one, 1year option. Coinmach, Family Pride & MacGray were awarded the contracts October 21, 2003
to service various senior developments, with slightly staggered commencement dates that were
driven by varying construction schedules at sites and laundry facilities within the Senior Housing
Portfolio. These existing arrangements will continue as revenue sharing contracts, under which
the vendors and the CHA mutually benefit from laundry revenues, while enabling residents to
enjoy the convenience and reliability of laundry facilities, amenities and services close to their
residence. Coinmach’s, Family Pride’s & MacGray’s record of quality service has provided
prompt resolutions of customer’s service concerns, efficient use of the debit/smart card systems,
observance of suitable time frames for equipment installation, upgrades and improvements, as
well as the vendor’s favorable performance of regular maintenance and emergency repairs.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-108
