Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety
A. Update on System Quality Dashboard (Attachment # 1)
B. Quarterly Set Targets Achieve Results (STAR) Report (deferred)
Dr. Krishna Das, System Interim Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation, provided an
update on the System Quality Dashboard. Subjects reviewed in the update included the following: objectives;
key dashboard metrics; core measures summary Q3 2012; heart failure composite Q3 2012; heart failure
individual measures; pneumonia composite Q3 2012; pneumonia individual measures; acute MI composite Q3
2012; AMI individual measures; SCIP-Inf composite Q3 2012; SCIP-Inf individual measures; SCIP-Card
measure Q3 2012; SCIP-VTE measure Q3 2012; selected process measures - immunization and Emergency
Department throughput; patient satisfaction with care; selected outcome measures - hospital acquired infections
and mortality and readmissions; and considerations in selection of “Big Dot” quality measures.
Chairman Michael stated that this way of presenting the information is very helpful. He indicated that further
thought should be given to the following: comparing the System to benchmark values or national averages is
helpful, but one of the questions that should be asked going forward is, is the System aiming to achieve the
benchmark value that is the national average, or does it want to do something better than that? Dr. Das stated
that comparisons can be presented in a variety of different ways; she indicated that an internal discussion needs
to be held regarding how the System will do that, and how the System wishes to set the goals.

Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety (continued)
Dr. Das added that she is hoping that this discussion is a spring-off point for that. This data will need to be
reviewed in some detail with the medical staff, and the administration would like to see how the medical staff
wishes to set the targets, as well. Dr. Das stated that if one looks at the top 10% of hospitals, the benchmarks
are 100% in all of these indicators; she noted that it may be worthwhile to make that more explicit on the
dashboard.
Chairman Michael stated that the reason for his earlier suggestion is to get people thinking about this, so people
do not just assume that the benchmark value is what the System is striving for. He stated that the priorities for
the goals and the areas to focus on for improvement should really be coming from the medical staff. With
regard to comparisons, he stated that, in some cases, the benchmark should be the national average, in others,
the benchmark should be comparable to that of the top 10% of hospitals in the U.S.
Chairman Michael stated that there have been a number of organizational changes within the System that have
recently taken place, including the addition of Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of Clinical Integration. He stated
that Dr. Shannon and Dr. Das will need some time to work with the medical staff to reach an agreement or
consensus on those areas that the medical staff believes are the areas of most importance to focus on for quality
improvements. He added that there is also an element of this that has not been directly discussed – it is one
thing to measure, it is another thing to understand how to make the improvements that are needed. The ultimate
goal is to develop a plan to improve in these key areas. To do that, agreement and commitment of the medical
staff, along with the support of the Board, is needed. Chairman Michael stated that it is his hope that progress
will continue.
During the discussion of the data on inpatient immunization rates, Chairman Michael inquired as to the reasons
for the System’s deviation from the benchmarks. Dr. Das stated that each inpatient receives a standing order for
vaccinations, under the directive of the Medical Director. However, one of the problems with this relates to a
process issue with staffing and the ability to get these medications in - because of the shorter and sicker nature
of the inpatient stay, people have a lot of testing done within a short period of time, so the opportunities to give
the vaccine and educate the patient are limited within the hospital. There are also some cultural issues, in which
the patients are extremely reluctant to receive these vaccinations; it can be a struggle for nursing and physician
providers to explain and convince the patients to take the vaccine. There are some processes in place, but she
feels that there is an incomplete understanding of the limitations in the System, both from a practical standpoint
in terms of the process of administering the vaccinations, as well as from a cultural standpoint with the patients
and staff.
During the Committee’s discussion on Emergency Department throughput metrics, Chairman Michael inquired
whether it is possible to go back historically to look at the seasonal numbers to determine from winter to winter
what effect it has, and determine whether the winter season is driving the numbers up 2-3%, and normalize the
numbers for that in some way. Dr. Das stated that staff has looked at the historical data; she noted that there are
other factors that influence the numbers. She stated that she will review the data to see if there is a clear
seasonal fluctuation; she added that the numbers do tend to go up in the winter.
With regard to benchmark comparisons, Director Muñoz stated that he believes it would be more helpful for the
Board to see a comparison to other public safety net hospitals, because they tend to share a similar population
with similar type diseases, along with comparisons of data on the national averages. Dr. Ozuru Ukoha,
President of the EMS of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, noted that, in comparing the System with
similar institutions across the country, one also has to look at the volume of patients and patient-doctor ratio –
other institutions may be doing better than the System because they have access to more resources. Chairman
Michael stated that this is a great point – one of the things that the Committee needs to hear from the medical

Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety (continued)
team and the nursing staff is what additional staff or resources are needed to reach or exceed the benchmarks set
for quality improvements.
Dr. David Barker, Chief Medical Officer of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County, provided
information on quality efforts relating to vaccination of HIV patients at the CORE Center. He proposed a
quality goal for consideration by the Committee and Board, regarding having the System adopt a quality goal of
what proportion of its patients have been tested for HIV in the last two years. This would be started off as a
System measure, then it would be moved down to a clinic and inpatient service measure; he added that,
eventually, it might need to be taken to a provider level. He added that this is something that is very important
for the patients; it is an inexpensive test and does not cost much in terms of additional resources – it takes more
clinician time to ask the patients to be tested, but that is all it takes.
Dr. Linda Rae Murray, Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, provided
information on the Department of Public Health’s activities relating to quality measures. She stated that there
are several quality teams that have measures - they meet regularly to work on those measures. Every month, a
department-wide quality meeting is held; this is followed by a regular report to the System. Around this time,
staff begins discussing what measures that will be used starting December 1, 2013; therefore, as the next fiscal
year begins, those measures are already there.
Dr. Das stated that once a process is targeted for improvement, the way to construct an intervention consists of
looking at the data on the sub-processes and examining all the factors that affect that outcome. There is a fairly
structured way to go about it. In order to improve a process, it does require a multi-disciplinary team, but it also
requires a dispassionate examination of the data that is driving that process. There are myriad teams working in
the System on process improvement; she noted that they are almost all multi-disciplinary teams.
With regard to the information on hospital acquired conditions, Chairman Michael inquired whether there are
other items that would normally be included on this list, beyond infections, falls and ulcers. Dr. Das stated
that there are other rare events that can occur. She indicated that there is a list of “never events” that includes
events like air embolisms, blood transfusion reactions and surgical mistakes. She is hoping that, going forward,
the System will have a way of capturing these better in real time; the System does not currently have an
automated method to do that. Right now, those events are captured from the claims database, so it goes to the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and comes back to the System in claims.
With regard to readmissions, Dr. Das stated that that discussion is fairly complicated; at some point, she would
like to have a detailed discussion regarding the multiple factors that influence readmissions. A variety of
systems issues are rolled in within this one metric. There are very important confounders when viewing
readmissions data; for example, there are very good correlations between the socioeconomic status of patients
and readmissions. Another factor that drives the readmission numbers is the admitting patterns of the hospital.
For example, if there is a significant backup in beds, as the System often experiences, a lot of the heart failure
patients are put in observation status, instead of being actually admitted. Observation patients do not enter into
the readmission metric that CMS has established. System staff puts patients in observation because there simply
are not any beds available; however, that is often not where they should really go. If a patient is put into an
observation stay for a long time, ideally it would be better to create inpatient beds for them. Dr. Das noted that,
if inpatient beds are created, the System would be taking patients that may have a higher risk for readmission
(heart failure) and putting them into the pool, so the readmission numbers may go up.

Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety (continued)
Chairman Michael stated that this might be a subject for future discussion, regarding the reality that CMS is
going to be looking at some of these measures. The Committee and Board needs to understand where the risks
may lie, if the numbers remain where they are. Dr. Das concurred; she stated that, besides having a discussion
on readmissions at a future date, a discussion on value based purchasing and the entire spectrum of pay-forperformance metrics would be useful.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
presented his report. He stated that he recently discussed a matter with Dr. Shannon, regarding the
resurrection of a plan for chronic illness centers of excellence at Provident Hospital. Provident Hospital
staff worked on the plan a couple of years ago with PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants; a document was
put together, but the administration was limited in moving forward due to financial reasons.
Dr. Wakim provided an update regarding an incident that was reported at the last Committee Meeting, which
occurred at Provident Hospital. He stated that the Root Cause Analysis has been completed and will be
forwarded to the members of the Committee.
Dr. Ukoha was introduced and welcomed as the newly elected President of the EMS of Stroger Hospital. He
stated that he will be presenting a formal report at the next Committee Meeting.

New Business: Information Item - Overview of CCHHS Graduate Medical Education Affiliations
(Attachment #2)
Dr. John O’Brien, Director of Professional Education, reviewed an informational presentation regarding
Graduate Medical Education Affiliations. Subjects reviewed in the presentation included the following:
Overview; Affiliation Agreements-Program Addenda; Origin of Residents at Stroger; and Breakdown of
Rotators at Stroger. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
It was noted that the current Master Affiliation Agreement with Rush expires in 2014; with regard to plans for a
new Master Affiliation Agreement that would begin in 2014, Chairman Michael inquired whether any
significant changes are expected in the new agreement. Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, stated that the
overall strategy for medical education going forward is that the System is going to look for a partner whose
vision matches its own vision. Dr. Raju stated that the administration has met with Rush representatives and
they agree with the System’s strategy; therefore, the System’s administration is developing a vision statement
together with Rush. The next question that needs to be addressed, based on the vision statement, is what are the
needs of the County? The System’s clinical needs will be determined by the clinical staff; then, the residency
programs and other things will be driven by that need.

Information Item - Overview of CCHHS Graduate Medical Education Affiliations

Director Muñoz indicated that, as far back as 2006, when he participated in evaluating operations as part of
President Bobbie Steele’s Transition Team, he has wanted to have an outside independent audit of the entire
medical education process. He stated that it is a good idea to look at these agreements to see how they are
functioning, and to see the benefits to the County and its partner. An audit of this type has not been done in the
past – he recommended that before the System enters into any new agreements, an independent audit of this type
should be done. Dr. O’Brien noted that a study on academic affiliations was done in the past by
PricewaterhouseCoopers staff, to examine the financial value. The study did not speak to subjects such as
overall direction and whether the System is getting the appropriate value for its patients, it only looked at the
money aspect of the matter. Director Muñoz stated that it is important to examine the following questions:
How will these relationships work moving forward? What is the best possible relationship for this institution?
He stated that addressing these questions are important to be able to plan and project further into the future and
be able to employ some strategic thought into the process. Dr. O’Brien added that one of the principles of
medical education outcome measures relates to the question of whether the institution is training its physicians
that then stay on to become its attending physicians, its workforce. He recommended that this be added to the
other questions that Director Muñoz would like to have addressed. Dr. Raju stated that the administration is
looking at the subject of the Master Affiliation Agreement in a very different way; it is looking based on the
clinical needs of the population as opposed to medical education needs of the academic institutions. He
proposed to return to the Committee with information on the following: where and what the gaps in service are,
clinical needs, total number of patients to serve, and number of people needed to care for the patients.
