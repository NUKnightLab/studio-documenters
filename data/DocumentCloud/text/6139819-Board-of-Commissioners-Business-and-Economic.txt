WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment Classification
8 that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned commercial facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as buildings and

for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that justify
finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the
property is deemed abandoned; and
