DETROIT CHARTER REVISION COMMISSION

Notice of Meeting Cancellation
Greetings Detroit!
The Governorâ€™s state of the state address has been rescheduled for this
Tuesday, February 12, 2019. Detroit activists worked hard on her
campaign and have expressed an interest in watching her first address,
a number are even attending.
For that reason, there will be no Detroit Charter Revision Commission
meeting on February 12, 2019. The next meeting will occur on February
23rd. You will soon be given the details of that meeting, and the
Committee meetings that will occur in the interim. Thank you for your
involvement!
Signed,

The Detroit Charter Commission
