RE: DIBC EXPANSION

This memorandum is in response to the September 6, 2018 memo submitted by the of?ce of
Council Member Castaneda-Lopez in regards to DIBC Plaza Ezpaonsion. Initally, on May 2,
2018 the of?ce of Council Member Castaneda-Lopez submitted a memorandum to several City
departments with questions pertaining to the approved site plans, the closure of an alley-way
along St. Anne Street, the removal of a sidewalk along W. Fort Street and the legality of the
cement barricades and fencing presently in place.

For several month the Legislative Policy Division has been working with the Michigan
Department of Transportation (MDOT) to obtain copies of the site plans for the Ambassador
Bridge Plaza expansion on W. Fort Street. Regrettably staff has been unable to locate copies of
the site plans for the aforemention expansion, either from MDOT or the Buildings Safety
Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED). In 2017 BSEED conducted a purge of
previously approved site plans in an effort to better utlize available storage space. The MDOT
associate who oversaw the departmental review for this project has since retired and
departmental staff has not been able to locate any rendition of the submitted site plans.

In regards to the legality of the existing cement barricades and fencing, there are no violations or
citations present in the Tidemark system, which is utilized by BSEED for permitting purposes.

Should you have any additional questions, or concerns, please contact our of?ce directly.

Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 1829 Olympia Development of Michigan, LLC, request to encroach into
the public rights-of-way with a private storm water management system on Montcalm
Street.

Petition No. 1829 Giffels Webster on behalf of Olympia Development of Michigan, LLC request
for an encroachment consisting of a private storm water management system. The encroachment is
to be located on the South side of Montcalm Street, 50 feet wide, between Woodward Avenue, 120
feet wide, and Park Avenue, 60 feet wide; also on the East side of Park Avenue, between Columbia
Street (now an easement) 50 feet wide, and Montcalm Street.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation and report. This
is our report.

The request is being made as part of an upgrade to the Fox Theatre. The storm sewer outlet will
redirect a portion of the storm-water to Montcalm Street, and ultimately into the existing sewer in
Park Avenue. The work will be performed in accordance with the following standards: Michigan
Plumbing Code, DPW City Engineering Division and Detroit Water and Sewerage Department.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, and City Engineering Division -
DPW. Traf?c Engineering Division DPW (TED) approves provided that affected curb, sidewalk
and pavement is restored; and that the road closure for the work to be performed is approved by
TED. The TED conditions are a part of the resolution.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) reports being involved, but they have no objection
provided the DWSD encroachment provisions are followed. The DWSD provisions have been made
a part of the resolution.

DTE-Energy Electric reports involvement, but no objection. The storm sewer line must maintain an
18 inch vertical clearance from conduit running north and south at the alley east of Park
Avenue, and south of Montcalm Street. A provision for the required DTE clearance is a part of the
attached resolution.

Company reports involvement, but no objection. Gas Company reports an 8 inch
gas main located 14 feet west of the east line of Park Avenue. A provision for the unimpeded
operation, maintenance and replacement (if needed) of the gas line is part of the attached resolution.

 

All other involved City Departments, including the Public Lighting Authority and Public lighting
Department; also privately owned utility companies have reported no objections to the encroachment.
Provisions protecting all utility installations are part of the attached resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 354 Marathon Petroleum Company request permission to
vacate a section of Oakwood from the intersection of Dix and Oakwood to
the north for 1,872.82 ft and alleys between Sanders and Oakwood.

Correction: Minor error in one part of a legal description.

Petition No. 354 Mannik Smith Group on behalf of Marathon Petroleum LP request City
Council to accept the dedication of certain lands for public street purposes being the
Oakwood Avenue reroute, also requesting the vacation and conversion to easement of
part of Oakwood Avenue and two public alleys, all in the area of Dix Avenue, Oakwood
Avenue, and Sanders Avenue. Additionally the Department of Public Works is
requesting to convert an existing greenbelt into public right-of-way from the Oakwood
Avenue reroute to the Rouge River near Powell Avenue.

The dedication and conversion to easement requested by Mannik Smith Group on behalf
of Marathon Petroleum LP is being preposed in order to integrate a planned new
administration campus into the existing re?nery and for the bene?t of creating a larger
buffer between the traveling public and the existing re?nery.

A resolution granting the petition was approved by your Honorable Body on October 28,
2014 and found in J.C.C. pages 2214- 2228.

However, a review by Engineering has been made and a minor correction to
one legal description is needed and is herewith added as a part of this corrective
resolution. The revised legal description is represented in bold and underlined. All

deletions are represented in be??and?st?ke-through.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 315 Marathon Petroleum Company, LP, request to vacate alleys
between Ormond and Oakwood, and between Norway and existing public ROW.

Petition No. 315 Marathon Petroleum Company, LP requesting the vacation and conversion to
easement of: The east-west public alley, 20 feet wide, in the block of Oakwood Boulevard, 100
feet wide, Colonial Avenue, 66 feet wide, and Omond Avenue, 66 feet wide. Also the east-west
public alley, 20 feet wide, in the block of Oakwood Boulevard, 100 feet wide, Colonial Avenue,
66 feet wide, and Norway Avenue, 60 feet wide and north-south alley, 18 feet wide, ?rst west of
Norway Ave.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility review)
and report. This is our report.

The request is being made to consolidate properties on both sides of the alleys. Currently the alleys
are not improved and are used for utility services only.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, and Traf?c Engineering Division
DPW, and City Engineering - DPW.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the conversion to easement.
The speci?c DWSD provisions for easements are included in the resolution.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies have reported no
objections to the conversion of the public right-of-way into a private easement for public utilities.

Provisions protecting utility installations are part of the attached resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.
