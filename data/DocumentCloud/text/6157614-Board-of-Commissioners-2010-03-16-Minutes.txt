PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CALLING UPON THE GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO GRANT AUTHORIZATION TO
THE HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM BOARD TO LEVY TAXES FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII,
Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and
perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government has the responsibility for providing health care to the
indigent that no other County in the State has; and
WHEREAS, the demand for quality healthcare has increased over the years in addition to the
State of Illinois closing mental health hospital along with high unemployment rates and exoffenders returning to the community puts an overwhelming burden on Cook County to
provide adequate healthcare; and
WHEREAS, the financial problems confronting Cook County and the County’s
responsibility to fund public safety makes it difficult to meet the needs of quality healthcare;
and
WHEREAS, in an effort to ensure quality healthcare to every citizen it becomes necessary
for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board to become totally separate from the
Cook County Board of Commissioners, including financial independence; and
WHEREAS, the legislative body is the only authority that can create a taxing district to fund
the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board in order that it become financially
independent of the Cook County Board; and
WHEREAS, such taxing districts as the Chicago School Board were afforded the
opportunity to improve education, similar authority would give the Health & Hospitals
System Board a greater opportunity to become independent of Cook County thus minimizing
the politics and afford them an opportunity to bring in revenue for the sole purpose of
providing healthcare in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the tax levy shall not exceed the existing amount of taxes collected by the
County Board for the purpose of healthcare; and

12

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010
WHEREAS, a permanent Health & Hospitals System Board with its own consistent revenue
source would be in the best interest of the citizens of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners call upon the Governor and members of the General Assembly to grant
authority to the Health & Hospitals System Board to levy taxes for the sole purpose of
providing healthcare in Cook County.

REQUEST TO APPEND A REVISED LETTER
TO A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED COMMITTEE REPORT
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 9, 2010 from
JOHN P. DALEY, Chairman, Audit Committee
In order to ensure that each member of the Board has had an opportunity to review the contents of the
amended response, I am requesting that the following letter from the Clerk of the Circuit Court be
received and filed. This amended letter from Clerk Brown was received by my office on March 5,
2010, which was subsequent to the approval of the Audit Committee Report of February 9, 2010 at the
meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners held on March 2, 2010 (Agenda Item #6).
AMENDED LETTER FROM CLERK BROWN
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 4, 2010 from
DOROTHY BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
Re: Revised Response to Question 3 of February 8, 2010 letter
Dear Chairman Daley:
On February 16, 2010 the Clerk of the Circuit Court submitted to you a written response
to three questions you presented in your correspondence dated February 8, 2010. This

13

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010
letter is a revision of our response to question number 3 of your letter, regarding
Communication Number 301501, which was on the agenda for the February 9, 2010
meeting of the Audit Committee.
Following is your question and our revised response to the question; changes are
underlined.
Question 3: “What would your position be on a proposal to accept certified checks
and money orders only, to reduce the incidents of NSF checks?”
For customer service reasons, the Clerk of the Circuit Court is proposing that we give the
customers the option of paying by certified checks, money orders, or a personal check
guaranteed by a service. Cook County could enter into a county contractual agreement
with a personal check guarantee service, and/or an immediate bank account debit service
in order to ensure guarantee of available customer funds at the point of service. The cost
of implementing and maintaining a personal check guarantee service partnership could be
borne by check writers opting to tender personal checks. Cook County could then
continue its practice of accepting personal checks and reduce the incidents of NSF
checks, at no cost to the County. This proposal would allow the Clerk of the Circuit
Court, and any other Cook County agency, to continue to provide excellent customer
service to our citizens by allowing personal checks to be used for payment, and not just
certified checks and/or money orders, and also eliminate exposure to NSF checks.
According to our research, the costs involved with various check guarantee services
range from as low as $0.14 per check, to as high as 1.45% of the check amount, plus
$0.28 per check. In addition to the per check fee, there is a monthly account service fee
and a monthly statement fee that would range from as low as $5.00 per month, to as high
as $40.00 a month. After performing a check volume analysis of county agencies
accepting personal checks and selecting a vendor, the County would set a nominal fee to
be paid by each customer to absorb the cost of the monthly fees.

WHEREAS, state, county and local budgets are in crisis, partially because of a recessionary economy
and governments at all levels are experiencing staff, program and service reductions; and
WHEREAS, municipalities and counties across our State have received ten percent of all state income
taxes received for over forty years, since the tax was created; and
WHEREAS, said revenue sharing program was instrumental in the tax being enacted by the State
Legislature; and

14

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010

WHEREAS, Governor Pat Quinn has announced a thirty percent (30%) reduction in the share of the
income tax distributed to counties and municipalities; and
WHEREAS, said announcement contradicts statements made at the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus in
December 2009, and “passes the buck” of the State’s budget problems to counties and municipalities; and
WHEREAS, any reduction will further aggravate the situation local county and municipal governments
are facing with respect to the provision of public safety and health programs for our residents; and
WHEREAS, the Governor’s proposal will create “a hole” of approximately $23 per capita in the budgets
of every community in Illinois at a time when these county and municipal governments are experiencing
uncontrollable reductions in revenues; and
WHEREAS, this reduction will create a shortfall for Cook County and a $65.7 million shortfall for the
City of Chicago; and
WHEREAS, the recessionary economy has resulted in a 12% reduction in sales taxes for counties and
municipalities and an 15% reduction in the local share of the state income tax.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County implore the Governor and the State Legislature to oppose any reduction in the local share
distribution of the state income tax.

WHEREAS, there are entities that significantly contribute to the quality of life in a community and are
crucial to the success of that community and its citizens, one of the most important being its educational
system; and
15

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010

WHEREAS, a key component of a quality education is a proper learning environment that is protected
from external noise and distraction; and
WHEREAS, the O’Hare Noise Compatibility Commission (ONCC) is aware that Ridgewood High
School in Norridge, Elk Grove High School in Elk Grove Village and Carpenter Elementary School in
Park Ridge qualified for sound insulation in 2004 and that, despite the continuing noise imposed by the
air traffic from O’Hare International Airport, none of these schools has joined the ranks of the 117
schools that have been awarded sound insulation under the ONCC School Sound Insulation Program; and
WHEREAS, the eligibility requirements for sound insulation were changed in 2005 and despite having
qualified previously, Ridgewood, Elk Grove and Carpenter schools were eliminated from the eligibility
list by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); and
WHEREAS, since that time the ONCC, as well as several municipalities in Cook County, have
consistently and diligently worked for the reinstatement of Ridgewood High School and have also worked
to obtain sound insulation for Elk Grove High School and Carpenter Elementary School. The ONCC and
its membership believe the students of these schools deserve the same freedom from airplane noise as the
117 other schools surrounding O’Hare that benefit from sound insulation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County do hereby urge the FAA to reverse its position and grant the much needed sound insulation to
Ridgewood High School, Elk Grove High School and Carpenter Elementary School to give their students
a setting that is conducive to learning success.

misdemeanors and Class 4 felonies and which are nonviolent. The State's Attorney may seek a prearraignment investigation which may include, but need not be limited to, assessment by a mental health
and substance abuse service provider to determine whether the suspect is eligible for diversion. If a
diversion plan is agreed upon by all parties involved, it may include a requirement that the diverted
detainee adhere to an individualized treatment and service plan developed by an appropriate clinician,
provision for restitution with respect to injuries or property damage caused by the diverted detainee and
may identify a case manager who shall monitor the diverted detainee's compliance with the diversion plan
and report on such compliance as required in the diversion plan.
(3) Pre-trial diversion to special courts. This level shall continue to emphasize proper assessment and
speedy trials for those detainees who have been diagnosed by the appropriate clinicians as being mentally
ill or mentally ill with co-occurring substance abuse disorders. If a detainee has been diagnosed as being
mentally ill or diagnosed with mentally ill with co-occurring substance abuse disorders and is held over
for trial the detainee shall have immediate access to the appropriate treatment services. The case should
be referred to the appropriate special courts for a speedy trial. This category of diversion is subject to the
approval of the court.
(4)

Post-adjudication diversion.

a. This category of diversion is for persons adjudicated guilty of an offense by the courts. In cases where
a person has also been found, by a licensed clinician, as being mentally ill and suffering with substance
abuse it has been agreed on by the courts that a diversion plan may be developed, that person shall be
eligible for immediate treatment.
b. This category of diversion consists of dispositions in the Juvenile Court and the misdemeanor courts
within the jurisdiction of the District 4, Maywood Courthouse of the Circuit Court of Cook County and
the Mental Health Court. In appropriate cases as ordered by the court, a diversion plan may be developed
as a condition of a defendant's probation or supervision. The court may consider assignment of a case
manager to monitor the defendant's compliance with the diversion plan and may require notification of
the arresting law enforcement agency or other parties prior to the defendant's release from custody or
discharge from hospitalization for mental health or substance abuse treatment.

45

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010
(a)
This Jail Diversion pilot Program is designed to strengthen existing jail diversion efforts

This Jail Diversion Pilot Program will include four types of diversion, each of which
shall be subject to the approval of the appropriate authorities and have agreed-upon conditions by all
parties involved, the agreement shall be tailored to particular circumstances, for which diverted detainees
shall be held accountable. The four categories of diversion are as follows:
(1)

(2)

Pre-booking diversion. Pre-booking diversion may be sought by local law enforcement
for mentally ill detainees and substance abuse, booked for Class B and C misdemeanors,
as often as possible. The arresting officer shall be the first line of contact and shall be
encouraged to take the following basic steps prior to any official charges for minor and/or
nuisance crimes:
a.

Attempt to resolve any crisis without harm to the suspect, general public, or law
enforcement officials.

b.

Refer directly to a hospital or treatment center when appropriate.

c.

Contact parent or guardian if mentally ill and substance abuse detainee is under
17.

d.

Evaluate the situation and determine if the suspect is potentially divertible.

e.

Determine if detainee can be sent to his or her residence under conditions agreed
upon by law enforcement, detainee, parent(s) or guardian, and the victim of the
crime.

f.

Contact a community based mental health and substance abuse service provider
when appropriate for proper assessment and referral for services.

g.

If no community based mental health and substance abuse service provider is
available contact the 24-hour regional crisis center for crisis intervention.

h.

In cases where the detainee has caused injury to a person or damage to one's
property, the appropriate authorities shall be encourage to explore all efforts for
restitution as a condition of pre-booking diversion.

i.

Complete a detailed incident report.

Post-booking diversion. This category of diversion may be sought by the State's
Attorney for mentally ill and substance abuse detainees who are detained for crimes that
constitute Class A misdemeanors and Class 4 felonies and which are nonviolent. The
State's Attorney may seek a pre-arraignment investigation which may include, but need
not be limited to, assessment by a mental health and substance abuse service provider to
determine whether the suspect is eligible for diversion. If a diversion plan is agreed upon
by all parties involved, it may include a requirement that the diverted detainee adhere to
an individualized treatment and service plan developed by an appropriate clinician,
provision for restitution with respect to injuries or property damage caused by the
diverted detainee and may identify a case manager who shall monitor the diverted

55

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010
detainee's compliance with the diversion plan and report on such compliance as required
in the diversion plan.
(3)

Pre-trial diversion to special courts. This level shall continue to emphasize proper
assessment and speedy trials for those detainees who have been diagnosed by the
appropriate clinicians as being mentally ill or mentally ill with co-occurring substance
abuse disorders. If a detainee has been diagnosed as being mentally ill or diagnosed with
mentally ill with co-occurring substance abuse disorders and is held over for trial the
detainee shall have immediate access to the appropriate treatment services. The case
should be referred to the appropriate special courts for a speedy trial. This category of
diversion is subject to the approval of the court.

(4)

Post-adjudication diversion.

Sec. 46-206.

a.

This category of diversion is for persons adjudicated guilty of an offense by the
courts. In cases where a person has also been found, by a licensed clinician, as
being mentally ill and suffering with substance abuse it has been agreed on by
the courts that a diversion plan may be developed, that person shall be eligible
for immediate treatment.

b.

This category of diversion consists of dispositions in the Juvenile Court and the
misdemeanor courts within the jurisdiction of the District 4, Maywood
Courthouse of the Circuit Court of Cook County and the Mental Health Court. In
appropriate cases as ordered by the court, a diversion plan may be developed as a
condition of a defendant's probation or supervision. The court may consider
assignment of a case manager to monitor the defendant's compliance with the
diversion plan and may require notification of the arresting law enforcement
agency or other parties prior to the defendant's release from custody or discharge
from hospitalization for mental health or substance abuse treatment.

(c)

Resumption of prosecution. Failure to comply with the diversion plan shall
subject the diverted detainee to further prosecution.

Crisis intervention training.

The intergovernmental agreement shall explore funding and promotion of training opportunities
for law enforcement and service providers with respect to crisis intervention involving persons with
mental illness and substance abuse which shall include recognition of mental illness and substance
abusers, knowledge of available local resources and the use of less than lethal force.

Transmitting a Communication, dated March 11, 2010 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
LETTER
Dear Ladies and Gentleman:
In June of 2009, the Cook County Tax Reactivation Project was unable to continue to
perform services. This was a result of failure to obtain additional funding from the State

64

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010
of Illinois for the longstanding project (previously known as the “South Suburban Tax
Reactivation Project”) despite the many successes achieved in areas of the County that
suffer from underdevelopment and blight.
In order to continue to promote commercial and industrial development and further
revitalize Cook County, the Cook County Stimulus and Revitalization Project shall be
created (CCSRP). The CCSRP represents a re-tooling and refocusing of the original
South Suburban Tax Reactivation Project and an effort by the Assessor’s Office to staff
and support initiatives by the South Suburban Mayors and Managers Association, the
Metropolitan Planning Council, the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus and Chicago
Metropolitan Agency for Planning.
The CCSRP will target areas close proximity to public transportation and major
thoroughfares, with the goal to revitalize in these communities. With a more limited
scope, the CCSRP will be able to leverage the work of other projects, and work with
these organizations, as we move toward the goal to revitalize the County. Also, the U. S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development through the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program will be seeking to invest in the County’s Southland and this project will provide
the necessary assessment data and coordination in its efforts. Goals of this effort include
the need to ameliorate foreclosure/abandonment rates, target the neediest populations to
be served and to eliminate blight. Implementing this project will stimulate opportunity
and enhance the community and public safety.
It is requested that the County provide an initial grant in the amount of $205,000.00 to
integrate services and programs and participate in development projects. It is the intent
of the CCSRP to seek permanent funding sources to ensure continued operation of the
project. The CCSRP would report to the Assessor’s Office and make recommendations
for programs and initiatives where appropriate.
In order to fund the initial grant for this important project, it is requested that the County
Board authorize a transfer in the amount of $205,000.00 from the 499 account to the 764
account.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Aunt Martha's Youth
Service Center, Inc., Olympia Fields, Illinois, to operate the Circuit Court of Cook County's Juvenile
Court Evening Reporting Centers.
Reason:

Aunt Martha's Youth Service Center, Inc. is recommended based upon a Request for Proposal
(RFP) (09-50-1053P). Aunt Martha's Youth Service Center, Inc. was the only vendor to
respond to the RFP.
Evening Reporting Centers have been established as community-based alternatives to
detention for a target group of minor respondents who would otherwise be detained in the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC). Aunt Martha's Youth Service Center, Inc. is
designed to provide structured supervision of each adolescent after school and through the
early evening hours to minimize the opportunities the participating adolescents might have to
otherwise engage in activities that are not lawful and allow the adolescent to remain in his or
her home/community. The Centers are also designed to teach social/life skills, to provide
reinforcement for pro-social behaviors, to provide support to each adolescent on school work,
and to collaborate with the Juvenile Justice System to increase positive/productive behaviors
and reduced negative/destructive behaviors.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,971,160.00 (FY 2010 - $1,073,633.00; FY 2011 - $1,332,560.00; FY 2012
- $1,341,400.00; and FY 2013 - $223,567.00). Contract period: February 1, 2010 through January 31,

COOK COUNTY LAW LIBRARY
PROPOSED CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
BENNIE E. MARTIN, Executive Law Librarian, Cook County Law Library
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Innovative Interfaces, Inc.,
Emeryville, California, to lease its Millennium system, an automated integrated library management
system, and for services from the company associated with installation of the system, including project
management, software configuration, training, implementation, consulting, data loading and maintenance
services.
Reason:

The Millennium system will replace the existing system, which was installed in 1992, and is
no longer supported by its vendor, and is inadequate for the Library's needs. The new system
will integrate the library's processes for acquisition, check-in, cataloging, and payment of

80

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010
library materials, not all of which are currently automated. It will also produce a web-based,
online public access catalog of the library's holdings.
Innovative Interfaces, Inc. was selected through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process per
County requirements. This vendor can fulfill the specialized automation requirements of a
large county law library, migrate the bibliographic data for this large collection from the
current system to theirs, and grow with the changes in the legal publishing and legal research
worlds to continue to meet the needs of the Cook County Law Library and its patrons.
Innovative Interfaces, Inc. has worked with other county law libraries.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $335,904.00 (FY 2010 - $112,730.00; FY 2011 - $70,476.00; FY 2012 $70,476.00; FY 2013 - $70,476.00; and FY 2014 - $11,746.00). Contract period: May 1, 2010 through
April 30, 2015. (530-579 Account). Requisition No. 05300001.
Sufficient funds are available through the Cook County Law Library Fund.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with the technical aspect of this
recommendation.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

WHEREAS, 55 ILCS 5/5-39001 authorizes the clerk of all civil trial courts at the county seat of
government to collect a filing fee to defray the cost of operating and maintaining a county law library; and
WHEREAS, P.A. 96-0227, effective August 11, 2009, authorizes counties in Illinois to increase the
County Law Library Filing Fee to defray the cost of operating and maintaining law libraries, from the
current maximum of $13, to maximums of $18 in 2009, $19 in 2010 and $21 in 2011; and
WHEREAS, P.A. 96-0227 was supported by many other counties around the state including: DeKalb,
DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, Madison, McHenry, McLean, St. Clair, Tazewell, Will and Winnebago
Counties; and

81

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010

WHEREAS, prior to enactment of P.A. 96-0227, the General Assembly only increased the maximum
filing fee by three dollars, during the previous 20 years, which is less than half of the CPI increase during
that same time period; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board last authorized an increase in the filing fee for the Law Library in
2004; and
WHEREAS, thirteen dollars has been inadequate in defraying the costs of operating and maintaining the
County Law Library; and
WHEREAS, the Law Library’s budget has decreased by $1.8 million (25%) which has led to a
reduction in the Library’s staff by 15 positions (24%) over the past five years; and
WHEREAS, a misperception exists that all relevant legal information is freely available online to the
average citizen, when, the average citizen does not have subscriptions to online legal publications; and
WHEREAS, county law libraries provide the general public with access to justice, which includes both
print and electronic legal information and research assistance they would not be able to access anywhere
else; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s Law Library is a National Hub Law Library which provides citizens with
access to over a quarter of a million print titles and several online legal databases and with seven branch
libraries, it is the only law library in the area that is freely available to all people without restriction; and
WHEREAS, other counties, law library filing fees are much higher than Cook County’s, for example:
Los Angeles’ filing fee, a similarly sized county, is $24, Sacramento, California ($50); San Francisco,
California ($42); San Diego, California ($38); Alameda, California ($37); El Paso, Texas ($35); King,
Washington ($20); and Wayne, Michigan ($20); and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Law Library has the vision of being able to more efficiently reach our
constituency through technology and is in the process of migrating to a new online integrated library
management system.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
32 Fees, Section 32-1 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 16, 2010
LETTER REGARDING THE CLOSURE OF DIVISION 2 - DORM 4
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 4, 2010 from
THOMAS J. DART, Cook County Sheriff

LETTER
Dear President Stroger:
I wanted to make you all aware of some encouraging developments we are set to
announce at the Cook County Jail that, if present trends hold, could lead to millions of
dollars in savings to county taxpayers.
Due to a continuing decline in inmate population, we have closed a 600-bed building on
the jail campus (Division 2 – Dorm 4). And absent a sudden spike in the inmate count,
we plan to close a separate 300-bed building (Division 3) sometime next month.
Combined, those two moves will reduce our total bed availability from 10,000 to 9,100.
It seems hard to believe that just a few years ago – 2002 to be exact – we were averaging
more than 11,000 detainees per day at our jail. Keep in mind, our capacity is only 10,000.
Today, our population is about 8,600 – a level we’ve not seen in 15 years.
The closures of these jail buildings have the potential to save millions of dollars in
personnel and maintenance cost. We are redeploying the officers assigned to these posts
which will result in an immediate reduction in overtime cost. The Department of
Facilities Management has informed us that they will realize substantial cost savings due
to the “moth-balling” of the buildings.
As you all know, we are awaiting federal court approval for the creation of an
administrative hearing process for our electronic monitoring program. The existence of
an administrative release mechanism is crucial if we are to maintain low population
levels.
As we make these moves, I want to thank each of you for your ongoing support
throughout the first four years of my administration. As we all move forward into
difficult budgetary times, I vow to continue to work with each of you to find ways to
operate my jail more efficiently and responsibly.

Sincerely,
Thomas J. Dart
Cook County Sheriff
