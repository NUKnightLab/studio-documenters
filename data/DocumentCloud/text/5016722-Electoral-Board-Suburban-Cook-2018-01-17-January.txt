PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
PROPERTY TAX INCENTIVE - PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENT
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 74 TAXATION, Section
74-71 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-71. - Laws regulating the payment of wages.
(a) Living wage requirement.
(1) Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that receives
a property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9
multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living Wage, as defined in the Cook
County Procurement Code (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. IV, Div. 1 ยง 34-121), to each of
its onsite Employees, unless such Employees' Wages are governed by Federal or State prevailing
wage law. For purpose of this Section, the term "Employee" shall mean an Employee who
performs duties or services for an Employer on average at least 30 hours per week in any twoweek period for which the Employee is paid; "hours per week" shall mean hours for which an
Employee is paid or entitled to payment by the Employer for a period of time during which no
duties are performed by the Employee due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity, jury duty,
military duty or approved leave of absence.
(2) On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive shall
notify all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this Section.
Upon commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a property that receives a property
tax incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the municipality or the Cook County
Board, as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such lessee is paying a Living Wage to its
Employees in compliance with this Section. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
requirements of this Section shall not apply to an Employer who was a lessee and not an owneroccupant of a property that receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.
(3) This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-profit organizations or funded by Federal
grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a property that receives
a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance. Further, this Section shall
not apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County Board that compliance with the
requirements of this Section would cause such Employer to be in violation of the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and a labor union.
(4) Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living Wage
requirements and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the Living Wage.

 In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee contends that the
Employer is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this section, that Employee may
file a complaint with the Cook County Commissioner on Human Rights ("Commission"). The
Commissioner shall investigate alleged violations of the Living Wage Ordinance and is authorized
to adopt regulations for the proper administration and enforcement of its provisions. If at the
conclusion of the Commission's investigation, the Commission finds that the Employer has
violated this section, it shall (i) in the case of an Employer receiving a property tax incentive,
notify the Assessor; or (ii) in the case of a Contractor or a subcontractor required to pay the Living
Wage, notify the CPO, who shall exercise such remedies as are in the best interest of the County,
including ordering the Employer to pay back pay and penalties, as provided in this section.
(5) If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required to pay
back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be fined by the County up to $100.00 for each
affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such penalties will not be
imposed on any Person except after a hearing (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 2, Art. IX). Further,
if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, the property tax incentive for this property
is subject to revocation.
(6) If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer's property
tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer appropriately reinstates or compensates
such Employee.
(7) For the purposes of this Section:
Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2 of this
Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily residential
property. "Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted to supportive living
facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing home care for low income older persons and persons
with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certified by the State Department of Public Aid pursuant to
Division 2 of this Article; and
Sales tax means the Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax.
(8) Living Wage Affidavit. Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a Resolution
or Ordinance or authorized officer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant for a Class 6b
industrial property or a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive shall maintain in its files and
records documentation that such municipality or the County Board received and filed the Living
Wage Affidavit submitted by the owner or lessee of such property stating that such owner or lessee
is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in compliance with this Section. Further, an applicant
or lessee of a Class 9 multifamily residential property tax incentive shall provide the municipality
or the Cook County Board, as the case may be, a Living Wage Affidavit which shall be maintained
by such municipality or the Cook County Board in its files and records.
(b) Prevailing wage requirement.
(1) Any owner of real estate that on or after January, 2018 is an applicant for, or recipient of, any
Property Tax Incentive under any Assessment Class as set forth in Division 2 of this Article for
which a Resolution or Ordinance from the municipality or the County Board is or was required,
or where an authorized officer letter is or was obtained in lieu of such Resolution or Ordinance,
shall pay all laborers, workers and mechanics engaged in Construction work within, or relating to
Construction projects within, the subject property not less than the prevailing rate of wages paid

 for work of a similar character on public works in Cook County. This requirement extends to all
contractors, subcontractors, and lessees who perform such Construction work, whether or not at
the direction of the owner.
(2) The prevailing rate of wages shall be the same as the then-current rate for Cook County determined
pursuant to the Illinois Prevailing Wage Act (820 ILCS 130/0.01 et seq.).
(3) (a) Unless otherwise defined herein, the definition of any terms used in this Section which are also
used in the Illinois Prevailing Wage Act (820 ILCS 130/0.01 et seq.) shall be the same as that set
forth in the Illinois Prevailing Wage Act.
(b) For the purposes of this Section:
Property Tax Incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2 of this
Article for any property regardless of the Assessment Class.
Construction means all work on any newly constructed building or structure, or any alteration,

Property Tax Incentive under any Assessment Class as set forth in Division 2 of this Article for

or where an authorized officer letter is or was obtained in lieu of such Resolution or Ordinance,
shall:
(a) keep, or a cause a contractor, subcontractor, or lessee performing the Construction work to keep,

Construction work has occurred. The certified payroll shall consist of a complete copy of the records
identified in this subsection (a), but may exclude the starting and ending times of work each day. The
certified payroll shall be accompanied by a statement signed by the owner or an officer, employee, or agent
of the owner which avers that: (i) he or she has examined the certified payroll records required to be

does not knowingly rely upon a false certification. Cook County shall keep the records submitted in
accordance with this subsection (b) for a period of 5 years from the date of the last payment for Construction
work. The records submitted in accordance with this subsection (b) shall be considered public records,
except an employee's address, telephone number, and social security number, and made available in

 accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. Cook County shall accept any reasonable submissions
that meet the requirements of this Section.
(5) The recipient must provide credible evidence that, at all times after it receives and maintains any
tax incentive designation under Division 2 of this Article, if any Construction, occurs at the subject

in an active apprenticeship and training program approved and registered with the United States
Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeship, if the contractor or subcontractor employs people
in a covered occupation.
(6) Prevailing Wage Affidavit. Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a
Resolution or Ordinance or authorized officer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant for, or a

shall pay, or cause a contractor, subcontractor, or lessee to pay, the prevailing rate of wages in
compliance with this Section and comply with subsections (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this Section. The
failure to file such affidavit and supporting documents within the time established by the
Assessor's rules shall result in the loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing or
revocation under Section 74-73.
(b)(c) State or Federal Laws.
(1) Except where a Person has requested an exception from the Assessor and the County Board
expressly finds that granting the exception is in the best interest of the County, such Person

incentive classification, then, after notice from the Assessor of such violation, the Person or
Substantial Owner shall have 45 days to cure its violation and request an exception or waiver from
the Assessor. Failure to cure or obtain an exception or waiver of ineligibility from the Assessor
shall serve as grounds for revocation of the classification as provided by the Assessor or by the
County Board by Resolution or Ordinance. In case of revocation or cancellation, the Incentive
Classification shall be deemed null and void for the tax year in which the incentive was revoked
or cancelled as to the subject property. In such an instance, the taxpayer shall be liable for and
shall reimburse to the County Collector an amount equal to the difference in the amount of taxes
that would have been collected had the subject property not received the property tax incentive.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

INSPECTOR GENERAL
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 2 Administration, Article
IV Officers and Employees, Division 5 Inspector General, Section 2-285 and Section 2-287 of the Cook
County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 2-285. Cooperation.
(a)
It shall be the duty of all County employees, officials, agents, contractors, subcontractors,
licensees, grantees or persons or businesses seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of
eligibility for County contracts, to cooperate with the OIIG in the conduct of investigations undertaken
pursuant to this division. Every County contract and every bid, proposal, application or solicitation for a
County contract and every application for certification of eligibility for a County contract or program shall
contain a statement that the person, individually and on behalf of the applicant, will abide by all provisions
of this division. It shall be unlawful for any person subject to this Section to refuse to cooperate with the
Independent Inspector General as required by this Section. The penalty for such violation shall be governed
by Section 2-291.
(b)
All persons with whom the OIIG requests an interview are required to comply in a timely
fashion. Within constitutional limitations, failure by any County employee, official, agent, contractor,
subcontractor, licensee, grantee or person or business seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or
certification of eligibility for County contracts, to cooperate with any reasonable request by the OIIG carries
the threat of sanctions and/or criminal contempt proceedings, and any other penalties the County Board has
within its scope to assess.
(c)
Nothing in this compliance section may be interpreted to allow the OIIG to violate any
individual's constitutional rights, including the 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.
(d)
It is the duty of every employee, department and elected official to cooperate with the
Independent Inspector General in any investigation or hearing. Each department's premises, equipment,
personnel, books, records and papers shall be made readily available to the Independent Inspector General.

 (e)
If the Independent Inspector General issues a recommendation of corrective action to the
head of a County department or bureau, that department or bureau head must respond to that
recommendation within 30 45 days with a written response to the Independent Inspector General and Chief
of the Bureau of Human Resources. This response must include either (1) a description of any corrective
action the department or bureau head has taken or (2) a request for a 30-day extension of the 30 45 day
decision period if additional time is needed by the department or bureau head to review the recommendation
of corrective action. If the head of that department or bureau did not take any corrective action, or took a
different corrective action than that recommended by the Independent Inspector General, the department or
bureau head must describe the different action and explain the reasons for the different action in the written
response. This response must be submitted to the Independent Inspector General and Chief of the Bureau
of Human Resources within the 30-day decision period. The Independent Inspector General may approve
a request for an extension of this 30 45-day decision period for a period of time not to exceed 30 days if
additional time is needed by the head of the department or bureau to review the recommendation of
corrective action. If a department head, bureau chief, or separately elected official fails to meet the 45-day
requirement or, if approved, the 30-day extension the Independent Inspector General shall notify the Chair
of the Litigation Sub-Committee and the President when there is a failure to reply. The chair of the
Litigation Sub-Committee may then call the department head, bureau chief, or representative of the
separately elected official to appear before the Litigation Sub-Committee to explain the lack of response.
(f) It shall be the duty of all County employees, officials, agents, contractors, subcontractors,
licensees, grantees or persons or businesses seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of
eligibility for County contracts to report, directly and without undue delay, to the Independent Inspector
General any and all information concerning conduct which they know to involve corruption, allegations of
political discrimination in nonexempt positions or other criminal activity, by another County employee or
official, which concerns his or her office of employment or County related transaction. The knowing failure
of any employee to report as required above shall constitute cause for discipline up to and including
termination. For purposes of this Section, a report made to the Inspector General Hotline shall be considered
a direct report.

Sec. 2-287. - Quarterly reports.
No later than the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year, the Independent Inspector
General shall submit to the President and the County Board a publicly available report, accurate as of the

federal property. It is the intent of this Cook County Ordinance to provide the same priority to licensed
blind vendors on County property by requiring County Departments to give priority to licensed blind
vendors in the operation of vending facilities on County property and preference to licensed blind vendors

County employees, County contractual employees, and the general public. The determination shall be based
upon a site survey or any other reasonable means enabling an accurate assessment of the location. If the
property has an existing private vendor, bottler, or vending machine operator, then the property shall be

number of people using the location is or will be insufficient to support a vending facility, then the BEPB
shall determine the property to be not satisfactory. Upon a determination by the BEPB and the Committee
that the new property or building is satisfactory for the operation of a blind vendor vending facility, the the
Director of County Real Estate shall inform the County Department to comply with the priority established

 for the operation of vending facilities by blind persons under this Ordinance. All County departments shall
fully cooperate with the BEPB to ensure that priority is given to blind vendors in the operation of vending
facilities on County property. This includes notifying the Department prior to the expiration of existing
contracts or agreements for vending facilities or when such contracts or agreements are considered for
renewal options. The notification must be given no later than 6 months prior to the potential expiration or
