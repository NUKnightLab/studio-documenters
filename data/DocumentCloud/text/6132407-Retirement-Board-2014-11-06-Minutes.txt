Election Report
a. Report of Independent Election Administrator
Nickol R. Hackett, Executive Director, presented the Final Report of the Independent
Election Administrator about the results of the election that was held on October 29, 2014,
for a Cook County Employee Member Trustee. The IEA report reflected that two individuals
filed nominating petitions for the position and were placed on the ballot. The election was
conducted according to the rules adopted by the Board. After the ballots were processed, the
IEA determined that Mr. Brent Lewandowski received a majority of the votes cast. The
deadline for contesting the results of the election was November 4, 2014, and no petition to
contest the results was filed. The IEA requested that the Board declare Mr. Brent
Lewandowski the winner of the election. Ms. Hackett further stated that in 2015, three
trustee positions will be open and that an election will be conducted to fill the positions for a
County Employee Member Trustee, a County Annuitant Member Trustee and a Forest
Preserve District Employee Member Trustee.
It was moved by Trustee Janura and seconded by Trustee Richardson that the Final Report of
the Independent Election Administrator dated October 31, 2014, be accepted as a true and
accurate report of the results of the election held on October 29, 2014, and consistent
therewith, that Brent Lewandowski was elected as the Cook County Employee Member
Trustee.
b. Proclamation and Declaration of the Winner of the Cook County Employee Member Election
held on October 29, 2014
The trustees then considered the “Proclamation of Election and Declaration of the Winner of
the Cook County Employee Member Election Held on October 29, 2014”, as presented with
the IEA’s election report and in which Mr. Brent Lewandowski was declared the winner.
It was moved by Trustee Janura and seconded by Trustee Richardson that the Proclamation
of Election and Declaration of the Winner of the Cook County Employee Member Election
Held on October 29, 2014, be accepted and, consistent therewith, that Brent Lewandowski be
declared the winner of that election and that he be administered and execute the Oath of
Office. It is further moved that the Fund’s staff take all action necessary to file a copy of the

Illinois Pension Code.

3. Benefit Matters
a. Spouse Annuity Application – Lepolean Redmond
Mr. Paul Rzeszutko, Director of Benefits, then reported on the status of the review
undertaken by the Fund staff concerning the application for a spouse annuity filed by Mr.
Lepolean Redmond, following the death of Ms. Barbara Rhames. Mr. Rzeszutko reported
that the death certificate the Fund received in 2001, provided that Ms. Rhames was never
married and that the Fund had paid out child annuity and death benefits accordingly. In
2014, the Fund was contacted by Mr. Redmond who claimed that he had been married to Ms.
Rhames. He then filed an application for a spouse annuity and he submitted a marriage
certificate showing that he and Ms. Rhames were married in 1997. He also produced a
corrected death certificate for Ms. Rhames which showed that she had been married to Mr.
Redmond at the time of her death. The Fund received confirmation from the County Clerk’s
office that the documents were true and certified copies and match their records. Mr.
Rzeszutko also reported that the Fund’s independent investigation of divorce records and
Social Security Administration records did not show that Ms. Rhames and Mr. Redmond had
been divorced.
The trustees also considered that if Mr. Redmond were eligible for spouse annuity benefits,
whether the benefits should be paid as of the date of Ms. Rhames death or upon Ms.
Redmond’s application thirteen years later. The Fund’s counsel, Mary Pat Burns, reported
that under Sections 9-118 and 9-137 of the Pension Code, relevant case law and the Fund’s
regular practice, that the annuity should begin one month after Ms. Rhames’ date of death.
After careful review of Mr. Redmond’s application for a spouse annuity, including the
supporting documentation submitted, and consideration of the applicable provisions of the
Pension Code, it was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode that the
Board find that Mr. Redmond is eligible for spouse annuity benefits pursuant to Section 9146.1 of the Pension Code and that the approved benefit should commence as of August 1,
2001.

b. Spouse Annuity Application – Elizabeth Hudson
Mr. Rzeszutko next reported on the status of the application for a spouse annuity filed by Ms.
Elizabeth Hudson which had been deferred from consideration at the Board’s meeting on
October 2, 2014. Trustee Herrera recused herself from all discussion and deliberation about
the spouse annuity application Ms. Hudson filed. Ms. Hudson’s spouse died in September,

 2014, and she filed an application for a spouse annuity based upon his County service. Ms.
Hudson had also been a County employee and had received annuity benefits based upon her
service record. In 2010, she was convicted of a felony and the Board determined that the
facts giving rise to her conviction were related to her service as a County employee. The
Board then revoked Ms. Hudson’s annuity benefits pursuant to Section 9-235 of the Pension
Code. The Board needed to determine whether Section 9-235 also precluded Ms. Hudson
from receiving a spouse annuity based upon her husband’s service record.
Upon review of a similar case involving the Municipal Employees’ Annuity & Benefit Fund
of Chicago (“MEABF”), the Illinois Appellate Court decided that applicant’s forfeiture of
annuity benefits due to a felony conviction did not extend to her eligibility for benefits based
her spouse’s service record. (Cirignani v. MEABF, 317 Ill. App.3d 732 (1st Dist. 2000)) The
Board weighed the costs of denying the application for benefits with the likely result that
such a determination would be reversed on appeal because of the decision in Cirignani.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Richardson that the Board find
that Ms. Elizabeth Hudson is eligible for the spouse annuity benefits in accordance with case
law.

 ii. Walter Peppers
Ms. Fahrenbach and Mr. Gary LeDonne, Senior Benefit Advisor then reported that the
Fund had denied an application for ordinary disability benefits filed by Mr. Walter
Peppers based upon Section 9-159(b) because he had been receiving disability benefits
from the State University Retirement System (“SURS”) for the same period during which
he had requested disability benefits from the Fund. Mr. Peppers had requested an
administrative hearing. Mr. LeDonne stated that the Fund had attempted to resolve the
matter with Mr. Peppers without success, but that it could continue those efforts.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board
appoint Mr. Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr. as the hearing officer for the administrative hearing
requested by Mr. Peppers to determine whether, under Section 9-159(b), he is eligible for
disability benefits from the Fund for the same period of disability during which he
received disability benefits from SURS.

4. Investment Matters
a. Consideration of October 30, 2014 Investment Committee Recommendations
The Executive Director then presented the recommendations made by the Investment
Committee at their meeting on October 30, 2014. She reported that the Fund’s Investment
Consultant, Callan Associates, had reviewed the core real estate rebalancing strategy and had
outlined specific implementation steps for the Board to consider.
It was moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board
adopt the recommendations made by the Investment Committee at their meeting on October
30, 2014, to increase the County Fund’s total PRISA SA allocation by $127 million, to
amend PRISA SA’s mandate to include a Forest Preserve Fund allocation of $5.5 million and
to increase the County Fund’s total J.P. Morgan Strategic Property Fund allocation by $127
million, the funding of which shall be made as presented. It was further moved that the
Fund’s staff be authorized to take all action reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing
including the execution and delivery of related written agreements on behalf of the County
Fund and the Forest Preserve Fund by the Executive Director.
It was moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board

5. Old Business/New Business
Mr. Rzeszutko then reported on the status of the County’s new payroll system. He stated that the
problems the Fund had been experiencing in the reports received from the County had been
substantially resolved and that the Fund was able to process annuity and benefit applications. Mr.
Rzeszutko reported that the last three payrolls received from the County were both timely and
accurate. He noted an increase in the number of annuity applications filed in November as
compared to earlier years. Mr. Rzeszutko also stated that the County’s new payroll system would
address the issues under Section 1-117 of the Pension Code so that the Fund would not receive
contributions in excess of the amounts allowed by that section.
6. Adjournment
There being no further business before the Board, it was moved by Trustee Janura and seconded by
Trustee Richardson that the trustees adjourn the meeting.
