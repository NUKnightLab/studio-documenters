Side Guard Ordinance

 

• Passed July 2017, Side Guard Ordinance requires
City contractors (over $2 million) to install side
guards and convex mirrors on large vehicles (over
10,000 lbs.)
• Side guards have been proven to reduce the severity
of injuries in side-impact collisions between
vulnerable road users and large trucks and convex
mirrors drastically increase the range of vision for a
driver.
• Currently working to ensure compliance with the
ordinance and increase the number of large vehicles
with these safety features even if not covered under
ordinance
