RE: NEZ HOMESTEAD (N EZI-I) UPDATED PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS

Find attached the map, dtd. July 2, 2019, which re?ects the proposed modi?cations of Council
Member Scott Benson, Council President Pro-Tem Mary Shef?eld and Council Member Janee Ayers
combined.

As council members engage the community and educate residents of the NEZ Homesteads, I urge you to
keep in mind that the NEZs were created to stabilize neighborhoods. They are a powerful tool capable of
both assisting in the revitalization of Detroit?s middle class and retaining residency.

As a Detroit City Council initiative, the designation of NEZ Homestead jurisdictions rely on the valuable
input of each individual council member, as such the attached map identi?es the modi?cations pr0posed
by council members who have submitted recommendations to date as additional modi?cations are
awaited.
