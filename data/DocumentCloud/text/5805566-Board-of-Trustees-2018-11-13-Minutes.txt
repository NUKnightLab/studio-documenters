(Investment Summary Report)

 NOVEMBER 13 459 2018

Chairperson Padilla moved the Report of the Committee on Investments to the omnibus.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CLAIMS AND SERVICE CREDITS
2019 Medicare Part B Premium Subsidy
Ms. Rosemary Ihejirika, Chief Benefits Officer, reported that there has been an increase in the 2019
Medicare Part B Premium as compared to the 2018 Medicare Part B Premium. She stated that since the
current subsidy is based on the 2018 Medicare Part B premium amount, the premium amount increase has
resulted in a $1.50 differential between members with and members without Medicare Part B coverage and
creates a burden to submit documentation for a subsidy differential of $0.75 per month. Staff recommends
subsidizing all members enrolled in the Medicare Part B premium in 2019 at 50% of the $132.50.

Review of 20% Billing under 40 ILCS 5/17-116(c)(1)
Ms. Ihejirika reported that CTPF bills CPS for a member who commenced employment before August
31, 1979 and who receives salary during any year after September 1, 1983, for the present day value of
the additional service retirement pension resulting from salary in excess of 20% of the preceding year’s
annual full-time salary rate, as required pursuant to 40 ILCS 5/17-116(c)(1). She stated that there are cases
in which the administrative cost of billing CPS exceeds the amount to be recouped. She presented for consideration the establishment of a de minimis billing threshold for billing the Employer. Staff recommends a
$100.00 de minimis threshold for billing. Ms. Ihejirika addressed questions raised by the Trustees.

Re-Retirement with Additional Service Compensation
Ms. Ihejirika reviewed the interpretation of 40 ILCS 5/17-149(c) wherein a retiree who returns to permanent employment for a period of less than 3 years, would make contributions during that time and would
have that time of service added to their previously determined pension benefit, but would receive no other
benefit changes. For retirees who return to permanent employment for a period of 3 years or more, their
entire benefit is recalculated, as if they had not previously retired. Retirees with less than three year of
return, permanent employment keep any previously accrued automatic annual increases, while retirees with
3 years or more of return, permanent employment would lose any previously accrued automatic annual
increases as part of their new pension recalculation.
Based upon this distinction, staff will review re-retirement cases for any possible overpayments in the case
of a retiree who did not complete an additional 3 consecutive years of service and may have received benefit changes beyond making contributions and receiving the additional service credit.

Motion to Adopt the Claims and Services Committee Report and Recommendation,
Approved
Ms. Padilla made a motion, seconded by Mr. Cavallero, to adopt the November 5, 2018, Claims and Service
Credit committee report and recommendation. The motion passed by the following vote:
Ayes: Mr. Blackwell, Mr. Cavallero, Ms. Padilla, Ms. Price Ward, Mr. Redfeairn, Ms. Reilly – 6
Abstentions: Ms. Rodriguez – 1

 NOVEMBER 13 460 2018

APPLICATION FOR PENSIONS

the persons, hereinafter listed, with the recommendations that they be approved and granted in the amount

DISCUSSIONS
Status Update Regarding FY 2018 External Audit
Representatives from Plante Moran presented an external audit status update report via telephone.
They stated that they are on track and ahead of schedule.

Status Update Regarding CPS Agreed Upon Procedures Report
Ms. Alise White, Chief Financial Officer, stated that staff received another reiteration of updates to the
original AUP report where they found a large variance for pensionable wages for the scope period of the
current audit. She stated that in the original drafts, Baker and Tilly had identified 705 exceptions. Staff
provided Baker and Tilly with additional information, which reduced the number of exceptions to 339.
CTPF staff has found inconsistences in the data provided by CPS. Staff is going to ask Baker and Tilly and
CPS to re-review the data.

Report on Employer Delinquencies and Payroll Audit Adjustments
Ms. White presented and reviewed the Monthly Aging Report for employer payroll delinquencies. She
reviewed a list of various schools which received a first and second notice. Ms. White announced that
Noble Charter School has paid their late fees in full.
Ms. Janet Camacho, Accountant, presented the Charter School Late Fees – Conditional Grace Period.
With the implementation of a new ERS system, the Board adopted and agreed with INCS to provide a
conditional grace period for late submission of payroll records and pension contributions. This includes
schools and charter holders who meet the conditions through evidence of timely and good faith efforts
to submit payroll records and make pension contributions due between July 9, 2018 and October 9,
2018.
CTPF staff is seeking the recommendation of the committee to take the waiver (in whole or in part) and
denial of waiver actions are detailed below.

Motion to Accept Staff Recommendation
Trustee Redfeairn made a motion, to make the recommendation to the full Board.
Due to a lack of a quorum of the committee of the whole, this acts as an informal recommendation of
the Committee.

Recommendations Regarding Waiver Requests for Lighthouse Charter
Chicago Lighthouse Charter provided additional information and documentation for the original waiver
submitted which was previously denied. Chicago Lighthouse Charter failed to mention there was a
change in management where they were required to immediately move from their location. The
employer secured a private loan to use towards the security deposit, but could not pay rent until further
funding arrived. ISBE remittance advice shows initial funding for the school arrived 9/5/2017. The school
is requesting the full amount of $10,101.21 be waived or reduced.
Chicago Lighthouse Charter did not receive funding from the State of Illinois until 9/6/2017 and that
contributed towards the late submissions. However, there was nothing preventing the Employer from
setting up their calendar in ERS. Staff recommends billing all the delinquent pay periods based on the
fact that there were no system failures.
3

 NOVEMBER 13 499 2018

Recommendations Regarding Waiver Requests for Sullivan House Charter
Sullivan House Charter (Youth Connection Charter holder) is claiming the reason for untimely payroll
submission is due to the ERS site. The ERS site prevented employer to continue the sign up because ERS
was requesting the upload of the YCCS charter agreement coveringSullivan House. Sullivan House did
not receive charter agreement from YCCS until 8/14/2018. After receiving the charter agreement, the
employer could not report until 8/21/2018 because the school was closed. The school is requesting the
full amount owed of $1,372.72 be waived.
Sullivan House Campus has never been delinquent in previous years. Untimely payroll submission is out
of character for Sullivan House Campus. CTPF had a copy of the requested charter agreement that
delayed submission. Staff recommends waiving statutory penalties, liquidated damages, and interest.

Recommendation Regarding Waiver Request and Payroll Audit of Henry Ford Power House
Charter School
David Bea, an attorney for HFLI Academies of Illinois, speaking on behalf of the dissolved charter’s
board, states the employer ceased operations and has not had any staff for over three years. In addition
to this, it is stated that the school’s only remaining asset is a bank account with approximately $5,000.
Because of this, and the condition and availability of the records necessary to complete an audit of the
school, Bea is proposing to settle outstanding late fees and cancel any planned audit of the school,
providing CTPF the remaining $5,000, the stated only remaining asset. The school currently owes
$45,218.10 in delinquencies.
Staff recommends conditionally accepting the $5,000 payment, subject to an analysis to make sure
there is no reasonable basis to recover from the parent company. However, subject to Henry Ford’s
acceptance, the $5,000 should be simply in satisfaction of the outstanding late fees and staff
recommends still having the Fund’s payroll auditors travel to the Dearborn warehouse to see if
documents can be secured to facilitate a full or partial payroll audit to ensure that Henry Ford’s
reporting and its employees’ contributions were accurate.

Executive Session
Motion to go into Executive Session
Trustee Redfeairn made a motion, seconded by Trustee Rodriguez, and unanimously passed, to go into
Executive Session for the purpose of discussing litigation and internal controls.
The executive session lasted from 3:05 p.m. to 4:06 p.m.

Motion to go into Open Session
Trustee Rodriguez made a motion, seconded by Trustee Redfeairn, and unanimously passed, to go into

related to the same.
