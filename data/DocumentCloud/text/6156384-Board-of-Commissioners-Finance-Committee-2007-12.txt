Commissioner Maldonado moved the approval of an amendment to exempt senior citizens to the

second.
Commissioner Peraica asked Michael Prinzi, Assistant State’s Attorney and Division Chief of the
Transactions, Municipal Litigation and Real Estate Taxation Division of the State’s Attorney’s Office, to
address the issue of the constitutionality of the proposed substitute ordinances (Communication
Numbers 289098 and 289099) sponsored by Commissioner Beavers.
Mr. Prinzi responded that based upon their review, it was believed that the Board’s authority to pass
these ordinances was well grounded under Home Rule authority established by the 1970 Constitution,
and under the Counties Code. He added that a position had been prepared by the Office of the State’s
Attorney in writing, and that he would get back to Commissioner Peraica on that point.
Commissioner Beavers, seconded by Vice Chairman Sims, moved that the Substitute Ordinance
(Communication Number 289098) be approved and adopted. Commissioner Peraica called for a
Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

Chairman Daley noted that there had been an interest expressed by members to bring in the elected
officials of Cook County and bureau chiefs/department heads under the President to further review the
proposed budget recommendations for their departments. He indicated that if it was the will of the
Committee to do so, he would call a meeting for such purpose.
After the members were provided with a report which listed Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007 appropriations
by department, highlighting the percent change from year to year, Commissioner Gorman requested a
more detailed breakdown of the reductions made by Commissioners to their individual office budgets;
Commissioner Schneider requested a more detailed breakdown of reductions made by business unit.
Jarese Wilson, Director of the Department of Budget and Management Services, responded that she
would provide the information to the Committee.
