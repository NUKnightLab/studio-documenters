Report from System Chief Medical Officer
Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, on behalf of Dr.
Terry Mason, System Chief Medical Officer, provided an update on the responses prepared and submitted to
The Joint Commission (TJC) regarding their recent survey at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County. She
stated that the administration has submitted all of the data to TJC and is waiting to hear back from them. She
noted that TJC indicated that they are a little behind in their responses due to the holidays and weather; it is
expected that a response should be received from TJC within a couple of weeks.
Dr. Fegan provided an overview of some of the follow-up items resulting from TJC’s survey. They involved
the following subjects: cleaning and storage of laryngoscopes; timely initial assessment of nursing admission
history and physical within twenty-four hours; documentation of operative notes and high-risk procedures; and
documentation of the lot numbers for fluid that is used to rehydrate tissues.
Dr. Fegan provided a brief introduction of a short video that addressed the subject of transparency; this video
was received at a recent National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems (NAPH) conference.
Following the video, Dr. Raju stated that currently, the administration is working on two initiatives relating to
transparency. The first initiative is regarding an adverse event disclosure policy. Under this policy, the System
staff will disclose the adverse event when it happens and will tell the patient that they are sorry; the effect of this
is to give the patient the confidence that all things will be done to make sure that such a thing does not happen
again. Secondly, he has indicated that he would like to quickly start putting the System’s quality data on the
public website.

Report from System Chief Medical Officer (continued)
In order to tie this subject back in to the discussions that have been held regarding the dashboard, Chairman
Michael stated that, at the next meeting, if possible, he would like to have a review of the data from 2012 of all
of the quality metrics that have been tracked, to highlight areas and focus on where there are some issues or if
there is a need for improvement. That can be used as a jumping off point to conclude the discussion in the next
couple of months about what the “big dot” items are going to be, for a focus on improvement over the coming
year. Tying that in with the transparency goals, as Dr. Raju has articulated, will put the System in a good setting
to move forward with the improvements that are desired in the quality and patient safety areas.

IV.

Report from System Interim Chief Nursing Officer
Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief Nursing Officer, provided an update on staffing. She stated that there
were not as many retirements as were expected, so with the recruiting efforts in Human Resources, nursing is
actually ahead in staffing. That was good news, as the administration was able to keep the floors open and
shut-downs were not experienced.
Ms. Russell provided an update regarding the flu season. She stated that daily flu clinics are being held at
Stroger Hospital in order for those staff who have not yet received their flu vaccine to come and receive their flu
shots. She noted that, although the Emergency Department is seeing an increase in their numbers of patients
presenting with the flu, she stated that she has not heard of any significant staff illnesses that have impacted
staffing.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Quality report from the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County (Attachment #1)
Dr. David Barker, Chief Medical Officer of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County, provided
an overview of the information contained in the quality report. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.
During the presentation, Chairman Michael inquired regarding electronic health records (EHRs) and their
implementation. He asked whether usage is starting to get easier and less burdensome, as people become
more familiar with the software and more accustomed to using it. Dr. Barker stated that, while providers
deliver quite good care, the documentation is not ideal. He believes that the root of the problem is that the
clinics have never been fully staffed; there are far too many providers versus medical assistant personnel. In
order to get more efficient, the System is going to need to hire more medical assistants to help out the nurses
and providers; in the long-term, this could have a lot of beneficial effects in terms of productivity and
decreasing overtime.
Dr. Fegan stated that this is a national problem. She stated that, if one was designing an EHR to further
clinical care, a different tool would have been developed; however, most EHRs were developed to improve
billing. This is an issue that she’ll be addressing before a Senate Committee Meeting next week in
Washington, DC, about the burden this creates on primary care in this country.
Dr. Linda Rae Murray, Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, indicated
that this technology is in its infancy. There are improvements and changes on a regular basis, which is
good; however, the improvements and changes are implemented in a disjointed way. The minute that the
EHR is changed, that impacts flow and process – and it is not always changed in a coordinated fashion. So
this is something upon which the System could internally improve.
Following the presentation by Dr. Barker, Dr. Murray suggested that a good example of a System-wide
indicator for the dashboard would be one of the indicators used by the CORE Center involving HIV testing.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
B. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. David Goldberg, President of the EMS of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, was unable to
attend this meeting as he had an unavoidable conflict; he will provide a report at the next Committee
Meeting.
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
presented his report to the Committee regarding the subjects that were discussed at recent EMS meetings.
Dr. Wakim stated that there was a quarterly medical staff meeting held on January 8th – the only material
questions that surfaced at that meeting related to the subject of the future of Provident Hospital and the role
it plays for the System. An Executive Medical Staff meeting was held on January 11th – there was a
discussion with Dr. Mason regarding launching a working group to determine how Provident Hospital can
play a more significant role for the community. In response to Chairman Michael’s question regarding the
timetable for the working group to make recommendations to the Board, Dr. Wakim stated that the working
group has been working in two-week increments for execution of each member’s duties and responsibilities
relating to the plan’s steps. Once the group has the final product, it will be brought to this Committee for
final approval and discussion.
Dr. Wakim stated that there was one Sentinel Event at Provident Hospital. The Root Cause Analysis was
started immediately, and was well attended. So far it was believed to be an unexpected result that staff was
not able to control. Once the final Root Cause Analysis is approved by the Executive Medical Staff and the
department responsible (Emergency Medicine) a summary of the matter will be provided.
