Premises affected - 4530 W. Hermitage Avenue
Subject Appeal from the decision of the Office of the Zoning Administrator in refusing to allow a

Single-Unit (Detached House) District. There are two residential buildings on one zoning lot.
There is a 3 dwelling unit building at the front of the lot and a 1 dwelling unit building with 2

demolished, the rear building becomes a principal use detached building. Section 17-1-1300
states no more than one principal use detached residential building may be located on a zoning
lot and a principal detached residential building may not be located on a zoning lot that contains
any other principal building. Section 17-15-0304-B states when a structure containing a nonconforming use (here 3 dwelling units) is intentionally damaged (demolition) by causes within
the control of the owner, re-establishment of the non-conforming use is prohibited. The new
house will also not have parking.
