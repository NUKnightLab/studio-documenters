CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60602
312/603-4304 Office 312/603-9988 Fax

FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIP DISCLOSURE PROVISION
Nepotism Disclosure Requirement:
Doing a significant amount of business with the County requires that you disclose to the Board of Ethics the existence of any
familial relationships with any County employee or any person holding elective office in the State of Illinois, the County, or in any
municipality within the County. The Ethics Ordinance defines a significant amount of business for the purpose of this disclosure
requirement as more than $25,000 in aggregate County leases, contracts, purchases or sales in any calendar year.
If you are unsure of whether the business you do with the County or a County agency will cross this threshold, err on the side of
caution by completing the attached familial disclosure form because, among other potential penalties, any person found guilty of
failing to make a required disclosure or knowingly filing a false, misleading, or incomplete disclosure will be prohibited from doing
any business with the County for a period of three years. The required disclosure should be filed with the Board of Ethics by
January 1 of each calendar year in which you are doing business with the County and again with each bid/proposal/quotation to do
business with Cook County. The Board of Ethics may assess a late filing fee of $100 per day after an initial 30-day grace period.
The person that is doing business with the County must disclose his or her familial relationships. If the person on the County lease
or contract or purchasing from or selling to the County is a business entity, then the business entity must disclose the familial
relationships of the individuals who are and, during the year prior to doing business with the County, were:






its board of directors,
its officers,
its employees or independent contractors responsible for the general administration of the entity,
its agents authorized to execute documents on behalf of the entity, and
its employees who directly engage or engaged in doing work with the County on behalf of the entity.

Do not hesitate to contact the Board of Ethics at (312) 603-4304 for assistance in determining the scope of any required familial
relationship disclosure.
Additional Definitions:
“Familial relationship” means a person who is a spouse, domestic partner or civil union partner of a County employee or State,
County or municipal official, or any person who is related to such an employee or official, whether by blood, marriage or adoption,
as a:
Parent
Child
Brother
Sister
