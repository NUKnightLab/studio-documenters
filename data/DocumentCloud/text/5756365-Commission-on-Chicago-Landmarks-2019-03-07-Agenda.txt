Proposed new, eight-story, commercial building with rooftop decks, a new curb cut off
Carroll, and underground parking
Applicant:

328 Carpenter LLC, owner
Paul Alessandro, Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture, architect

Staff Recommendation: Staff recommends that the Committee find that the project, with the
following conditions, meets the criteria set forth in the
Commission’s Rules and Regulations, the Commission’s
Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings and New
Construction, and therefore, the project will not have an adverse
effect on the significant historical and architectural features of the
landmark district and approve the project with the following
conditions:
1. The height and massing of the building as shown in drawings
dated 1/18/19 is approved as proposed;
2. The new 21’-wide curb cut proposed along Carroll Street to
access the two-way ramp for below-ground parking is
approved as curb cuts in general are part of the character of
secondary streets in the district;
3. The recessed terraces at the 5th-7th floors are approved as
proposed, with glass railings mounted to the inside face of the
walls;
4. Enlarged brick facade, window, railing, and storefront details

with spacer bar;
5. Exterior wall samples shall be reviewed for approval by

mullions (rather than butt glazing) similar to those used for the
lower portion of the building and all glass shall be clear vision;
7. Windows shall be incorporated into the south elevation at the
6th and 7th floors; and
8. The cladding for the upper floors shall be a dark metal panel
system with reveals to be detailed on the permit drawings.

Commission’s Rules and Regulations, the Commission’s
Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings and New
Construction, and Standards 6, 9, and 10 of the U.S. Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings
and therefore, the project will not have an adverse effect on the

property and district and approve the project with the following
conditions:
1. Historic Preservation staff shall review for approval all
dimensioned window and storefront details with the permit
submittal;
2. Historic Preservation staff shall review for approval all
material samples prior to order and installation;
3. As proposed, salvaged limestone shall be reused for the coping
of the one-story front façade; and
4. The proposed storefronts for the one-story portion shall be

Commission’s Rules and Regulations, the Commission’s
Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings and New
Construction, and Standards 6, 9, and 10 of the U.S. Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings
and therefore, the project will not have an adverse effect on the

 property and district and approve the project with the following
conditions:
1. As proposed, the rooftop parapets and garage cladding shall
match the existing Chicago common brick;
2. As proposed, the skylights shall be low profile, with
dimensioned details to be submitted with the permit plans for
