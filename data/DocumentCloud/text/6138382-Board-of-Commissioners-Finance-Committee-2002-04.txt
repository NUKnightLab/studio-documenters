REAL
PROPERTY ASSESSMENT
CLASSIFICATION
ORDINANCE
(PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT). Transmitting a Communication,
dated March 18, 2002 from James M. Houlihan , Cook County Assessor:
I am presenting to you for the consideration of the County Board of
Commissioners, proposed language amending the Cook County Classification
Ordinance relating to Class 9, Section 8 building units, reduction of the
assessment level for Class 3 properties, and expanding Class L (Landmark)
designation.
The language relating to Class 9, Section 8 will help to prevent the
displacement of critical Section 8 units that, without this assistance, might
otherwise be converted to condominiums. It applies to multi-family build ings
where at least 20% of the units are Section 8 and is applicable only to the units
in those buildings that are Section 8.

 FINANCE AGENDA
APRIL 9, 2002
PAGE 42

The supply of Cook County multi-family rental housing has diminished by over
5,000 units in the last 10 years and no market rate; non-subsidized affordable
rental housing is currently being developed. In order to maintain housing
options for middle class families and to attempt to reverse the 32% decline in
Class 3 multi-fam ily parcels, it is recommended that the assessment level for
these properties be 30% in tax year 2003 and 26% in tax year 2004, these
amounts reflecting the recalibration during the next assessment cycle.
Lastly, because it is desirable to encourage not only the preservation and
rehabilitation of individually designated commercial and industrial historically
and architecturally significant buildings, but also multi-family and not-for-profit
buildings and the contributing buildings within landmark districts; the definition
of landmark properties has been expanded to include such parcels.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
