LEGISLATIVE POLICY DIVISION
4.
Submitting report relative to Income Tax Reporting Regarding Non-Detroit
Residents Earning Income in the City. (President Pro Tem Sheffield directed the
Legislative Policy Division (LPD) to consult with the Office of the Chief
Financial Officer (OCFO) and draft an ordinance that mandates periodic
reporting to the City by employers of non-Detroit residents who earn income
in the City, which is therefore taxable by the City at the rate of 1.2%. Due to
the City’s well-documented fiscal challenges, the importance of collecting
every single potential revenue dollar cannot be overstated. And because state
laws limited mandatory withholding and other factors, it has been widely
alleged that many nonresident workers who actually earn income by work
performed in the City may nevertheless not be paying local income tax on those
earnings. Therefore this is a problem that cries out for solutions to benefit the
City and our residents.)
