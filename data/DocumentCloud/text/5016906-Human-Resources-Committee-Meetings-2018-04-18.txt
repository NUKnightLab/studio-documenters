Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
Barbara Pryor, Deputy Chief of Human Resources, provided additional information during the discussion of the
HR Strategies relating to fostering fiscal stewardship, in reference to implementing the Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) project. She stated that the payroll component is scheduled for rollout in early May, and expects
that it will take place sometime in May. The first paychecks from the new system are anticipated to be issued in
early June. Board Chairman Hammock stated that, from personal experience, he encourages staff to be
enormously rigorous in testing, particularly with overtime and with any unusual pay arrangements. He also
suggested that a Plan B be developed in case an employee for some reason does not get paid for whatever
technical reason. Ms. Pryor responded in the affirmative; she stated that the County’s ERP and Bureau of Human
Resources staff, along with CCHHS HR staff, are doing extensive testing around the payroll component, and will
be ready to be responsive to any issues as fast as they can be.
Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether payroll records are located on the County’s computer server. Ms.
Lopez responded that the County’s server houses all of the employee data. With regard to the server’s backup
features and disaster recovery, Board Chairman Hammock recommended that Ms. Pryor and Donna Hart, CCHHS
Chief Information Officer, discuss the matter further to ensure that Ms. Hart is satisfied that they have adequate
backup and disaster planning in place.
Chairman Richardson-Lowry stated that this is the last meeting and presentation for Ms. Lopez, as she will be
leaving the organization at the beginning of May. She and the Directors thanked Ms. Lopez for her tremendous
efforts and successes in her tenure. She stated that Ms. Lopez has shown that she values her work, her colleagues,
and the System. In turn, she values Ms. Lopez and her professionalism; her ability to lean in when there were
headwinds did not go without notice. She has no doubt that Ms. Lopez will be successful in her next endeavor.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, commented on Ms. Lopez’ departure. He stated that, during her
tenure, she has been a stabilizing force and source of constancy for the System. Under her leadership, the System
has greatly reduced the number of vacancies to a historic low, and has greatly reduced the time to hire and fill
positions. She is the single most responsible executive to bring the System to substantial compliance with the
Shakman Consent Decree; she was not only responsible for drafting and getting the Employment Plan accepted,
but also for drafting the policies and procedures that go along with it. Ms. Lopez thanked the administration and
Board for the rewarding opportunity to serve the System for the past eight (8) years, and thanked her HR team for
the outstanding work they have done during her tenure.
