the leadership of Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, a prominent African-American surgeon.
• Provident Hospital was the first African-American owned and operated hospital in America.
• Provident Hospital established the first nursing school for black women in Chicago.

remained unchanged, providing quality health care to the medically underserved.

invested more than $50 million to renovate the facility and upgrade clinical systems and equipment.

hospital. The hospital is an affiliate of Cook County Health, one of the largest comprehensive public

New Provident Facility

Debra Carey, Deputy CEO

COOK COUNTY


The New Provident Facility
A $240M investment, the replacement facility will allow Cook County Health to provide the community
with comprehensive, high-quality health care in a modern facility.

An eight story, 48-bed
hospital with comprehensive
outpatient primary and
specialty care, including
comprehensive emergency
room services will be built
immediately west of the
existing hospital. The current
facility will not close until the
new facility is opened in
2023.

 Provident - New Campus
Providing CCH and CountyCare Patients and Enrollees with
community health campus on Chicago’s Southside
• Original proposal new regional outpatient center, retaining existing inpatient
facility
• Need/demand assessment of area indicates lack of access to surgical services,
outpatient specialty care and diagnostic services
• Current facility not capable of supporting existing and new technologies
• Current outpatient setting not optimal for efficiency and patient experience
• Need services designed for managing care in prospective pay, risk-based
environment

 Medical Village Concept
Comprehensive array of services at one location convenient for
CCH/CountyCare patients & enrollees in catchment area
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

primary care medical home
specialty surgical and procedural care
diagnostic services
preventative (e.g., dental, lifestyle) programs
inpatient care
multidisciplinary care teams, led by CCH physician practice
community and home-based care coordination
co-location for certain social agencies (future)

 Updated Facility
•
•
•
•
•
•

Current facility requires millions of dollars to update
Creates appropriate physician office space
Supports state of art equipment such as MRI, monitoring
devices, other modern technologies
Reduced number of licensed beds
Creates efficient inpatient footprint designed for shorter stays
Creates surgical and procedural spaces efficiently designed
for ambulatory cases

 Patient Centered Focus
•
•
•
•
•

Providing patient choice in community facility designed for ease of
access and efficiency for surgical, diagnostic and inpatient care
Single room setting for privacy, infection prevention
Near park setting
Easily accessible via public transportation and ample parking on site
CCH / CountyCare patients and enrollees in catchment area can access
services near their communities

 Provident Inpatient
• Decreases bed footprint
- 42 medical/surgical beds
- 6 intensive care beds
- 8 operating rooms and 4 procedure rooms - 18-bay comprehensive emergency dept
• Reduces significantly transfers out to Stroger
• Targets admissions that are shorter stays, observation patients
• Increase number of admissions due to resumption of ambulance service
• Establishes Provident as CCH destination location for specific service lines provided for
the entire system
• Provides expanded services to retain CCH medical home patients in CCH network
• Facilitates contracting with other managed care plans at competitive rates with separate
provider number
• Provides ongoing safety net presence as transitions continue in health system market,
especially on South Side

 Volume Drivers
Fewer transfers from Provident ED to Stroger & other facilities
Increased admissions from ambulance runs
Preferred location for short stay admissions now going to Stroger
Retain services now leaving CCH due to insufficient CCH capacity e.g.,
endoscopy, orthopedics
• Create new centers of excellence based at Provident
o Joint Center
o Women’s Health (GYN, Breast Center, Heart Services)
o Senior Services/Geriatrics
o Men’s Health Services
o Capture admissions from 40- 50 % of Provident area patients currently
admitted to Stroger
•
•
•
•

 Stroger Impact
• Transfers to Stroger when decreased, gives more bed capacity at
Stroger:
Improves throughput, reduce time to assign inpatient bed
Expansion of complex service volume
Retain services now leaving CCH due to insufficient CCH capacity
Facilitates narrowing CountyCare network, transferring patients in who are out
of network
o Facilitates ability to contract with other MCOs for services
o
o
o
o

• Facilitates structuring surgical services to optimize facility capabilities:
o
o
o
o

Addresses Stroger OR cases per room (exceeds state standards)
Allows more ambulatory, less complex cases to move to Provident
Stroger ORs increased capacity for complex cases
Reduces time to schedule surgical and other procedures
