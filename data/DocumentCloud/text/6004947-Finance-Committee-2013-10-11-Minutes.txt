III. Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
With regard to request number 10, Mr. Oder inquired regarding the contract history.
responded that she can provide the information to him after the meeting1.

Ms. Besenhofer

With regard to request number 12, Director Hammock inquired as to the number of vendors that submitted a
response to the Request for Proposals (RFP) for this contract2. Ms. Besenhofer responded that she can provide
this information after the meeting. Director Ramirez inquired as to the length of the contract extension; he
asked whether staff can be recruited and on-boarded faster. John Cookinham stated that one of the problems
that the System will have with recruitment relates to the movement to the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Mr. Cookinham stated that
everyone in the area is going to have the same problems with recruiting and implementation of ICD-10. With
the complexity of ICD-10, it is expected that institutions may experience a nearly 50% decline in productivity.
There are already a limited number of coders in the Chicago area, so from that standpoint, with this proposed
contract, the System is just protecting itself to make sure that bills can continue to be issued and collected.
Director Ramirez inquired whether the in-house staff will be trained for this. Mr. Cookinham responded
affirmatively. He stated that there are currently twelve in-house coders; ten are certified and two are not
certified. The coders have begun to receive additional anatomy and physiology training, so that they can be
capable of doing the ICD-10 activity. There are open positions in the 2013 budget and additional positions
requested in the 2014 budget, and the administration intends to recruit for all of them; this would bring the
total number of in-house coding staff to approximately 26 to 29 individuals. Gladys Lopez, System Chief of
Human Resources, provided additional information on recruiting for these positions. She stated that positions
have been posted and potential candidates have been identified; however, the exam that is required to be taken
is an outdated version. Staff is working to address the issue, and is working with representatives from
AFSMCE, which is the union associated with those positions.
With regard to request numbers 24 and 25 (using those as examples), Director Hammock stated that, from the
information provided on the transmittals, one cannot get a sense of what the volume is3. Ms. Besenhofer
responded that she did not have the statistics with her, but could provide the information to him after the
meeting.
Director Ramirez, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 25. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Proposed Seventh Amendment to the Interagency Agreement between the Illinois Department of
Healthcare and Family Services and the Cook County Board of Commissioners (Attachment #2)
Joy Wykowski, System Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, and Mr. Cookinham provided an overview of
the request presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.
Director Ramirez, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of the request to
execute the proposed Seventh Amendment to the Interagency Agreement between the
Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

F. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare (Attachment #5)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver
Demonstration Project/CountyCare. He stated that, at the end of September, nearly 107,000 CountyCare
applications have been initiated – this represents an increase of almost 10,000 from the number reported last
month.
The majority of applications (65%) continue to be initiated through the call center, on-campus application
assistors and other program vendors; 30% have been initiated from CountyCare network partners, and the
remaining 5% have been initiated from the work within Cermak Health Services.
Over 76,000 applications have been submitted to the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) for
processing. The approval rate continues to hover around 85%.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on CountyCare (continued)
The average number of applications submitted to DHS per day remains right around 500. The State was
processing an average of 531 applications per day in September. This is the first time DHS has surpassed the
average number of applications submitted per day. This resulted in a slight decrease in pending applications
from last month, yet over 27,000 applications still remain unprocessed. In October, this trend reverses as DHS
trains staff to implement its new on-line systems.
A couple of months back, staff were asked to review maps of service providers and members to assess what, if
any, gaps in care exist throughout the County. After working with the GIS office downtown, they were able to
provide a map of applications submitted by zip code (Attachment #5).
The map illuminated a few key points:
• With only a few, small un-shaded zip codes, it is clear to see that applications have come from every
corner of the County. The administration is very proud of this accomplishment.
• There are areas of the County where applications would be expected to be submitted from at a higher rate
than what is actually happening – primarily in the near western suburbs and far southern suburbs.
• In areas with the heaviest concentration of applications, fewer access points for members are seen.
Because of this mapping, the administration is now looking at partners to ensure that capacity is sufficient
to serve the needs of CountyCare members.
The Committee received and filed the report without objection.

B. Update on Meaningful Use (Attachment #6)
Dr. Bala Hota, System Chief Information Officer, provided an overview of the information contained in his
update on Meaningful Use. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Following the update, Chairman Butler stated that he was in a meeting yesterday with the County Board’s
Finance Chair, and with representatives from various County agencies and elected officials, including those
from the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, Sheriff’s Office, and Judiciary; the purpose of the meeting
was to discuss the subject of spending $40 million to put an information system together. He inquired whether
System Information Technology staff was involved in the matter. He indicated that it is important that the
System be able to communicate any concerns or suggestions in the planning part of the process. Dr. Hota
stated that he was not aware of the meeting, but noted that he has a very good working relationship with the
County’s Chief Information Officer, Lydia Murray - he will contact her for more information on the matter.

Report from Chief Financial Officer
A. Financial Reports – through August 2013 (Attachment #7)
This item was taken out of order.
Mr. Cookinham presented the Financial Reports through August 2013.
discussed the information.

The Committee reviewed and

Mr. Oder discussed the subject of receiving budget comparison statements on a monthly basis. He stated that,
early in the fiscal year, Finance Chairman Heather O’Donnell asked him and Director Michael to review the
monthly financial report; as part of that review, Mr. Cookinham provided them with a copy of the monthly
budget. He thought that the monthly budget was good; he added that when one calculates a monthly budget,
what one thinks might hit in one month might actually hit before or after, but those budget variations are easy
to explain. He stated that the monthly financial report is excellent; however, he had a suggestion for one of the
schedules, which is the top income and expense report. Right now, the report has the year-to-date (YTD) of
the previous month, plus the current month, to get the YTD for the current month; his suggestion for that page
is to instead include the actual for the current month compared to budget for the current month, and the actual
YTD for the current month compared to YTD budget - this would allow the Committee to get that snapshot at
that point in time, compared to seeing where the System thought it would be. He asked whether management
would think about this for the next year.
Mr. Cookinham responded that the Finance team has made some adjustments to try to get closer to what Mr.
Oder is suggesting. He noted that one of the problems relates to getting monthly information from the County
source. The System keeps its records somewhat differently than the County, but it is dependent on getting
information back from County. He stated that staff can take a look at this and see what can be done.
Mr. Oder noted that the monthly budget information he received in the past was good – he wondered why it
was not regularly presented. Mr. Cookinham stated that part of his reasoning for not presenting it on a monthly
basis is because the information that the System receives from the County is somewhat behind – this is not a
traditional situation where invoices are captured and accrued when received. What would be produced on a
monthly basis would likely contain a lot of fluctuations that may end up being timing differences, rather than
fluctuations. His staff might be able to do something that provides a comparison, if they again took the
approach taken here where they are doing it on a YTD basis. Another aspect to this issue relates to the fact that
the County does not budget for depreciation or for the total cost of insurance expense, but the System does;
therefore, there will automatically be variances - they can be pointed out, but there will always be differences
in that sense. Staff can take a look at the YTD matter and hope that most of those fluctuations would take care
of themselves on a YTD presentation; however, for a monthly presentation, he believes that it will generate a
number of questions and will not really provide much more information.

VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Butler declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

Subject: Lease Schedule under replacement Master Lease Agreement with Banc of America
Leasing Corp and Capital Corp., LLC

In August 2010, pursuant to the authorization by this Board, the entered into a replacement
Master Lease Agreement with Banc of America Leasing and Capital Corp., LLC (?Banc of America?) for the
purposes of leasing capital equipment beginning in 2010. Under the Master Lease the parties may enter
into Lease Schedules with respect to specific items of equipment to be leased.

Under the Master Lease, the interest rate for each Lease Schedule is based upon the three-year United
States Treasury Maturity SWAP rate. The amounts payable under each lease schedule may therefore vary
depending upon changes in this indicator.

We are requesting you to permit to lease four pieces of equipment for the Ophthalmology
Department. The lease schedules will not be presented to the Chairman for execution until all proper
Procurement processes have been completed including the responsiveness of County Compliance for
participation.

The acquisition cost for these items is $457,414.37. This equipment will be leased pursuant to four
lease schedules under the replacement Master Lease Agreement. The lease schedules shall have a
term of 60 months and interest shall be based on the then-current SWAP rate. In the event Banc of
America is required to make certain interim payments to the manufacturer at the time of the
purchase and equipment delivery, a related agreement will be entered into with Banc of America,

in addition to the applicable Lease Schedule, or will be included in the amounts due under the
applicable lease schedule at the rate of PRIME minus 

Under the lease schedules, control and use of the equipment will rest entirely with the Health System. The
equipment is being acquired by Banc of America based on the Health System?s specifications and
acquisition pricing secured by the Health System.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended August 31, 2013. This discussion focuses
on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month.
It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the nine months with overall
revenue of $655,466 and overall expenses was $728,455.
Net Patient revenue for the nine months was $408,428.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
EHR incentive program revenue was $6,577.
Other revenue was $4,233. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
August-2013 reduced by 14 to 108 days. Additionally, there was a 5 day increase in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including 1115 waiver
and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $41.272M (14.0%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure increased by $20.791M (6.9%).
The growth in this figure indicates more accounts are moving to a billed status, but a
decreasing number of accounts are completing the collection process, which includes
charity care and bad debt write-offs.
6
Page 67 of 97

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of August-2013 increased by
$2.596M (29.4%), as compared the November 30, 2012 balance and increased by
$2.559M (22.3%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that
fewer inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of August-2013 increased by $26.374M (16.9%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure grew by $10.821M (6.7%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates more inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed”
status, but fewer accounts had the collection process completed than in the previous
month. This growth results in a lower number of accounts are being removed from
active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $3.810M (-22.0%) by the end
of August-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2012.
7
Page 68 of 97

 This balance, as of the end of this month, was $0.648M (5.4%) larger than the previous
month’s balance. This indicates that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed”
status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of August-2013 grew by $14.899M
(10.7%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is $9.970M
(7.2%) greater than last month’s figure.
The growth in this figure indicates that fewer Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

written-off directly to charity care.

Operating Expenses at the end of nine months was $728.455M broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $379.984M
Benefits - $104.153M
Supplies - $80.637M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $122.462M
Insurance - $8.817M
Depreciation - $25.464M
Utilities - $6.939M

Page 69 of 97

 Nonoperating Revenue was $235.066M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
cigarette tax in the amount of $87.026M and property tax in the amount of $59.689M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.
