INVOCATION
Chair Bell called upon Commissioner Baydoun, for the introduction of Reverend Fran
Hayes, Pastor of Littlefield Presbyterian Church, who gave the following invocation:
“Oh God of many names, lover of all nations and all peoples, you are the one
God to be worshipped by all. Oh compassionate and merciful God, to you belong praise and
glory and blessing. You, oh God, are the creator and sustainer of all that makes for goodness
and justice and peace. We give you thanks, oh God, for the diverse communities in which we
live and work here in Wayne County and for the blessings and challenges we know here. We
thank you, God, for simple things, for daily blessings that you give us that we so often take for
granted. Give all citizens strength of purpose and concern for others, that we may nurture a
society of peace and justice. Give us wisdom and goodwill and concern for all people. Work in
all our hearts to heal division and distrust and help us to work together to build communities
and a nation where each person has access to basic needs and to a life of dignity. We lift
before you this meeting of the County Commission; help them to use their authority to serve
faithfully and to promote the welfare of all who live within our County. Guide their decisions,
that they may be good stewards of all of the resources entrusted them. May everything that is
said here today and every action which is taken be for the good of our local communities and
the welfare of each person who lives and works in Wayne County. This we pray in the name
of the one God. Amen.”
