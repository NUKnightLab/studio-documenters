eighteen (18) months.
Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer, provided an overview of the metrics. During the discussion of
the quality metrics on Operating Room Efficiency for Stroger Hospital, she stated that a group has been
convened to address this subject; the group is meeting regularly and their work is fairly extensive. They

the subject of pressure ulcers, Dr. Shannon noted that the organization’s new chief nurse for hospitalbased services, Mohammed Abu Realh, has updated him on what the administration is doing regarding
hospital-acquired pressure ulcers; Mr. Abu Realh can go into some detail on that subject at the next
update to the Committee on Nursing Services.
Dr. Shannon noted that the focus for the March Committee meeting will be on Ambulatory measures; the
