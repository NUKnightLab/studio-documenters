Justice Assistance Grants
New Designations
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated September 16, 2016, on
FFY14 Justice Assistance Grant plan adjustments. He said that at the May 12, 2016,
Budget Committee meeting, the committee set aside $800,000 in FFY14 Justice
Assistance Grant (JAG) funds to support the Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent
Crime Notice of Funding Opportunity. The goal of the Illinois Partnerships to Reduce
Violent Crime Program is to reduce violent crime and strengthen the relationship between
law enforcement and communities by completing the Problem-Oriented Policing

and evaluation capacity, and implementing procedural justice and focused deterrence.

The differences in funding levels and budget line items of the proposed designations and
the two designations made for the same program at the August 18, 2016, Budget
Committee meeting were discussed.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY14 JAG designations. Mr.
Delfino seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote. Clerk
Brown abstained because she arrived at the meeting after the discussion on this topic had
taken place.
Matching Funds Requirement Waiver Request
Associate Director Givens said that since approval of the designation to the Rockford
Metropolitan Agency for Planning (RMAP) at the August 18, 2016, Budget Committee
Meeting for its Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime Program, the agency has
requested a JAG match waiver. The request was based on the loss of state fiscal year
2017 general revenue funding. No change in the federal designation was requested.
Ms. Northcott explained RMAP was short of funds due to the state’s budget impasse but
still incurred staff costs relating to existing obligations supported by federal and other
fund sources. A discussion ensued regarding matching funds requirements and
procedures to determine waivers of those requirements.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY14 JAG designations. Mr.
Delfino seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice vote with an
abstention from Ms. Hora.

Re:

Summary of Draft Lead Entity Policy

As staff drafts a policy that codifies and enhances long-standing effective practices, we ask
for the Authority Board’s input. The following draft summary of policy is an attempt to
create a transparent and competitive funding model that maximizes the use of Federal and
State funds and promotes accountability in each phase of the grant-making process. We
present it for the Board’s review and look forward to a productive discussion.
Lead Entities are used to pass through funds to sub-grantees to implement federal- and statesupported programs. The Authority may be designated as a Lead Entity by either a federal
funding source or a state appropriation, and directly funds and monitors the grantees that will
ultimately operate the grant-funded programs. In other instances, specific Lead Entities are
designated by statute or, for particular programmatic purposes, by the Authority. When a
Lead Entity is designated by the Authority, the Lead Entity is responsible for the fiscal
oversight and quality assurance of its sub-grants; Lead Entities conduct structured monitoring
of and provide subject matter expertise and technical assistance to sub-grantees. The
Authority monitors its grant to a Lead Entity through periodic progress reports.
Despite the Authority’s history of partnering with Lead Entities, the Authority lacks an
explicit policy governing how it designates and monitors Lead Entities to ensure compliance
with Authority principles and priorities, Federal and State law, and various policies.

6

 Draft Lead Entity Policy
I.

Designation of Lead Entities by the Authority

In evaluating the need for a new or existing Lead Entity, the Authority will determine
whether it is able to efficiently and effectively administer funds based on its own monitoring
capacity, its available resources for sub-grantee capacity building, and cost-effectiveness. If,
based on these considerations, the Authority determines that it cannot administer the funds as
effectively as required by its own policies and applicable statutes and regulations, then the
Authority will consider using a Lead Entity to administer those specific funds.
The Authority will weigh whether an organization is both versed in the services it will be
overseeing (in order to provide sub-grantees with technical assistance) as well as equipped to
function in an oversight capacity. Consideration will be given to the organization’s
established 1) subject matter expertise and record of providing services specific to the
federal/state grant, 2) network of direct service providers, and 3) monitoring capacity to
oversee its sub-grantees. All Lead Entities must comply with the Grant Accountability and
Transparency Act.
The Authority will conduct a periodic review of all existing Lead Entities to determine if
continued use of each Lead Entity is warranted. The review may consist of analyzing the
Authority’s administrative capacity, the community need for a Lead Entity, the Lead Entity’s
program outcomes, and input from peer service-providers and community stakeholders. A
review may be initiated by the Authority at any time if a fiscal management or programmatic
issue is raised.
II.

Grantmaking

Lead Entities shall utilize a competitive bidding process open to all service providers, with
limited exceptions. Each Request for Proposal (RFP), restricted RFP (open only to certain
applicants), and sole source Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) must be reviewed and
approved by the Authority prior to being published. The Lead Entity must provide a written
justification as to why each restricted or non-competitive funding process is warranted. The
Authority may require a Lead Entity to revise a RFP or NOFO or withhold approval.
To foster capacity building and innovation, Lead Entities may be required to designate a
specific percentage of their grant to RFPs for innovative pilots, demonstration projects, or
programs for underserved areas or populations. Additionally, Lead Entities shall be required
to make fiscal and programmatic technical assistance available to all sub-grantees and may
also be required to attend trainings hosted by the Authority.

7

 Each fiscal year, the Lead Entity will provide the Authority its RFP review panel conflicts of
interest protocol and objective scoring system for approval. Lead Entity RFP review panels
shall include stakeholders from varied backgrounds and may include subject matter experts
not affiliated with the Lead Entity, survivor network representatives, grant administrators,
researchers, and community stakeholders, among others.
Prior to notifying applicants of their awards, Lead Entities shall present to the Authority a list
of all the applicants, identify the chosen applicants, and detail how the Lead Entity will
monitor the sub-grantee and what technical assistance will be provided. The Authority will
perform a preliminary vetting of the sub-grantees and may deny a sub-grantee, impose
special conditions to the sub-grantee agreement, or reduce the amount awarded.
The Authority may choose to review a random cross-section of the proposals to ensure
applicants are appropriately scored. The Lead Entity shall make all proposals and scoring
documents available to the Authority upon request.
III.

Monitoring

Lead Entities are subject to the same monitoring requirements that the Authority applies to its
other grantees, including the submission of quarterly data and fiscal reports and regular site
visits by the Authority. Site visits will entail an analysis of the Lead Entity’s own program
outcomes and fiscal management as well as their monitoring of sub-grantees.
Lead Entities shall monitor sub-grantees to ensure compliance with State and/or Federal
statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the sub-award. All sub-grantees must
comply with Grant Accountability and Transparency Act requirements and submit quarterly
data and fiscal reports to their Lead Entity.
Sub-grantees are subject to site visits by both Lead Entities and the Authority and must make
available all fiscal, personnel, and programmatic data to the Lead Entity and the Authority at
either’s request. Prior to the execution of its grant agreement, each Lead Entity shall submit
their sub-grantee monitoring protocol to the Authority for approval. As the Lead Entity
awards each sub-grant, the Lead Entity shall forward a site visit schedule to the Authority
along with any increased monitoring provisions. Any future site reports created by Lead
Entities that require a corrective action by a sub-grantee shall be submitted to the Authority
along with verification of the corrective action. All unspent sub-grant funds must be returned
by the Lead Entity to the Authority at the end of the sub-grantee’s period of performance.

8

 Finally, Lead Entities shall conduct periodic program evaluations under the auspices of the
Authority. Program evaluations will be done by, or under the supervision of, an independent
program evaluator and submitted to the Authority.
The Authority will conduct periodic community needs assessments to identify shifts in
community needs and gaps in service.

SFY17 Funding Bullying Prevention Programs

At the August 18, 2016 Budget Committee meeting, $62,700 was designated to Goodcity as
fiscal agent for Prevent School Violence Illinois (PSVI) to conduct a two-day bullying
prevention training. Since that time, Authority staff have determined that the fiscal agent is
currently ineligible to receive state grant funds. Therefore, PSVI has selected Illinois Balanced
and Restorative Justice Project as their fiscal agent.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Chicago Survivors of Homicide Victims

Funding Source:

SFY17 Death Penalty Abolition Fund: $476,767

Program Description
In partnerships with the City of Chicago, Chicago Citizens for Change dba Chicago Survivors has been providing
crisis response and recovery services to family members of Chicago homicide victims under a non-Authority
administered federal discretionary grant since 2014. Thresholds has provided fiscal management and capacity
building support to Chicago Survivors. This project has been successful, serving Chicago Police Districts 004,
005, 009, 011, 015, and 025 since May 2015 and all police districts since September 2015. The Chicago Police
Department relies on Chicago Survivors to respond to a homicide within four hours under a joint protocol. In one
year, Chicago Survivors provided 357 homicide responses; 98 homicide crime scene de-escalations; more than
500 follow-up hours with families; and more than 2,500 hours of family support services. In addition, Chicago
Survivors provides training to Chicago Police Department detectives, state prosecutors, and other law
enforcement professionals on crisis response to survivors. The programs discretionary federal grant period ends
December 31, 2016. The recommended designation will support continued operation of this program from
January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2017. A sole source Notice of Funding Opportunity identifying Thresholds as the
only eligible applicant will be posted.
Program Activities
This funding opportunity will require Thresholds to issue a subcontract to Chicago Survivors for program
services, to continue to act as fiscal agent for Chicago Survivors, and to be responsible for program compliance
with all Authority requirements, including, but not limited to, fiscal and progress reporting, site visits, and
subcontractor site visits.
Through the sole source subcontract, Chicago Survivors will provide crisis response services, including provision
of immediate, on-site crisis responders to assist with de-escalation of retaliatory action or suicidal responses, and
needs such as temporary relocation; emergency childcare; crime scene clean-up; assistance with victims’
compensation; and assistance dealing with media, police, and medical examiners.
In addition, Chicago Survivors will provide recovery support, including a “warm transfer” from the crisis
responder to a family support specialist who will provide ongoing, regular case management; funeral planning
assistance; accompaniment to court proceedings; and linkage to other support services, including mental health
care. Chicago Survivors will provide individual support to each survivor family.
Finally, Chicago Survivors will conduct hands-on training to ensure the protocol is clear to all first responders
such as police, emergency medical personnel, medical examiners, hospital trauma center staff, and other pertinent
entities, such as prosecutors, school staff, and community-based social service providers. Trainings will be
designed to promote a trauma-informed approach and provide insight on how to appropriately respond to victims
experiencing trauma and complicated grief.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

National Forensic Science Improvement Act

Funding Source:

Federal Fiscal Year 2016 National Forensic Science Improvement Act

Program Description
National Forensic Science Improvement Act (NFSIA) funding is determined by federal formula. Staff proposes
use of federal fiscal year 2016 NFSIA funding to support ongoing improvements at the Cook County Medical
Examiner’s Office and nine crime labs across Illinois. These improvements will be made through agreements
with the DuPage County Crime Lab, Northeastern Illinois Regional Crime Lab, Office of the Cook County
Medical Examiner’s and the Illinois State Police. To develop this application, the Authority solicited proposals
for the use of FFY16 NFSIA funds including detailed budgets and information on agency planning,
management and the data collection processes.
Program Activities
NFSIA funds are principally used to purchase new lab equipment and to support required proficiency testing,
lab accreditation, and conference travel. In addition, funding for staff overtime and contractual toxicology
testing will help labs keep up with the demand for testing.
Priorities
NFSIA application guidance indicates the purpose of the program is to “help improve the quality and timeliness
of forensic science and medical examiner services. Among other things, funds may be used to eliminate a
backlog in the analysis of forensic evidence and to train and employ forensic laboratory personnel, as needed, to
eliminate such a backlog.”

FFY15 Victim Assistance Discretionary Grant Training Program
Introduction

The purpose of the Victim Assistance Discretionary Grant Training Program is to provide each
state and territory with funding to support training and technical assistance for victim assistance
providers and others who work with crime victims. States are encouraged the use of the funds to
enhance existing State Victim Assistance Academies or to establish new ones. These funds also
support statewide training initiatives, crime victim-related conferences, basic training for new
programs for underserved victims, and scholarships to service providers and others who work
with crime victims. As with all VOCA awards, states are given a time period of the fiscal year of
the award plus three years to spend the funds.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Illinois has an extensive network of coalitions and statewide issue groups supported by
legislation dedicated to victim rights and services. However, Illinois is a large, diverse state that
still has many unmet needs in the victim services field. Local agencies throughout the state
struggle to meet the training and staffing needs for their services. Issue-specific training is
available in some areas and increasingly required for some positions, but the availability of
training that is affordable and the opportunity to hear state and national experts in many fields is
often beyond the reach of local agencies.
Recommended designations will be used to expand training opportunities for victim service
advocates throughout Illinois. One such opportunity is available through the Illinois Victim
Assistance Academy (IVAA) of the Illinois Office of the Attorney General. Following the lead
of the National Victim Assistance Academy and the U.S. Office for Victims of Crime State
Victim Academies Cluster group, IVAA follows a curriculum and provides sessions that reflect a
more skill-based approach.
The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) also provides leadership in coordinating Illinois’
efforts to serve sexual assault survivors. Through the Illinois Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner
(SANE) program, the OAG coordinates 40-hour SANE educational component training on a
statewide basis and provides two-day advanced SANE and 40-hour pediatric SANE trainings.
Other training opportunities are provided through the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic
Violence (ICADV) and the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA). These agencies
20

provide training for victim service advocates through a network of partner agencies throughout
Illinois.
Since ICADV’s inception, its trainings have played an important role in helping advocates,
counselors, and criminal justice professionals across the state develop their skills. The trainings
also informs participants about emerging and topical issues in the field.
It is recommended that ICASA also receive funding through this program. In order to be most
effective in their work, counselors and advocates need training to ensure their information is
current. Changes in the law and turnover among advocates have created the need for annual
training. Sexual assault counselors also require training to stay abreast of new counseling
techniques to practice skills and to receive clinical consultation.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Victim Services Training Program

Funding Source:

FFY15 Victim Assistance Discretionary Grant Training Program

Program Description
The Office for Victims of Crime made $25 million available to eligible state victim assistance programs to
support training and technical assistance for victim assistance service providers and others who work with crime
victims.
Program Activities
The Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) will develop and implement a leadership academy
for professionals who serve domestic violence victims and their children. Individuals who complete this
academy will receive a solid foundation in leadership skill building within their organization and within the
violence against women movement, with a focus on the area of cultural diversity. ICADV will finish the first
cohort of the Leadership Academy which began in September 2016, a continuation of the current VOCA
training project. Additional cohorts of the Leadership Academy will be supported under this project. In addition,
ICADV is currently in the planning phase of an Advocacy Training series also supported by the current VOCA
training project. Planning will continue and training sessions will be held under this training project. Individuals
who complete this academy will have better focus on advocacy skills as related to inclusive, welcoming, and
client-centered services; have a deeper understanding of how trauma affects a person’s (both client and
advocate) ability to envision a different path, respond to multiple demands, and to present as what is often
described as a “good client.”; and better understand the barriers advocates and domestic violence agencies put
in front of survivors. This advocacy training will take a two-pronged approach – training of front lines staff and
training of managers/directors to support buy in and administrative support in this approach to service delivery.
Goal
The goal of ICADV is to develop inclusive and accessible services for all victims of domestic violence and their
children by raising the voices of diverse leaders within ICADV and within local domestic violence service
providers throughout Illinois. This will be done through the Leadership Academy and Advocacy Trainings.
Priorities
At the 2013 Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee meeting, training was established as a priority.

Funding Prospectus
Staff anticipates funding this project for three years. Year 1 allowed ICADV a planning period of 6-8 months to
develop the agendas for the six-session academy, develop curricula, and identify experts in leadership areas to
present. The academy was launched with its first cohort of leaders in September 2016. Years 2 and 3 will allow
ICADV to complete education of the first cohort, complete education of the second cohort from September
2017 to July 2018, and begin educating the third cohort September 2018. Throughout the process, ICADV will
evaluate and refine the curricula to meet the needs of each cohort of individuals. Each cohort will complete a
one year, six session academy.
The first sessions of the Advocacy Training will be held in Spring 2017 during Year 2 of the grant (January
2017 to December 2017) and include one two-day session for advocates and a one-day session for supervisors,
managers, and directors. Additional sessions of each will be offered in Year 3 of the grant (January 2018 and
December 2018).  
Past Performance
ICADV has a history of successfully providing training to domestic violence professionals and with positive evaluations.

complex trauma; two 20-hour trainings for rape crisis center advocates; and one 20-hour training for rape crisis
center personnel regarding program development to reach underserved populations, including victims of
prostitution and trafficking, runaways, and LGBT individuals, and a portion of the Illinois Coalition Against
Sexual Assault’s leadership development trainings.
Goals
The funding will result in several key outcomes for rape crisis center staff:


Enhanced capacity of counselors to work with sexual assault victims who have complex trauma that is
difficult to resolve.



Enhanced capacity of rape crisis center advocates to address violations of victim rights, engage in
systems advocacy and conduct professional training with medical personnel, law enforcement personnel,
and prosecutors.



Enhanced capacity of rape crisis center staff to build and deliver services to those who are prostituted or
trafficked, runaways, and LGBT youth. Additional services may include temporary shelter and case
management to address the spectrum of barriers faced by these survivors.

Priorities
This funding fits within the Authority’s goal of serving victims of violent crime, specifically sexual violence.

FFY15 Victim Assistance Discretionary Grant Training Program

Program Description
The Office for Victims of Crime made $25 million available to eligible state victim assistance programs to
support training and technical assistance for victim assistance service providers and others who work with crime
victims.
Program Activities
The Attorney General’s Office (AGO) will offer several training programs for advocates and nurses with
various levels of training and experience during the second and third years of a three-year training effort.
Year 2
Illinois Victim Assistance Academy (IVAA): Coordinated by the Illinois Office of the Attorney General, IVAA
offers a 40-hour course for victim advocates with two to five years of experience. Sixteen hours of training
occur online and the rest are classroom-based. The IVAA is an intensive course of study in victimology, victim
compensation, victims' rights and services, and issues specific to working with victims of crime in Illinois. This
funding will be used to conduct one IVAA training in Bloomington/Normal.
Advanced Illinois Victim Assistance Academy: The Advanced Illinois Victim Assistance Academy is a 1 ½ day
course on how trauma affects the brain. The Office of the Attorney General currently conducts an Advanced
Academy in Bloomington/Normal every other year. The topics of the advanced trainings vary to cover
emerging trends and respond to the training needs of Illinois’ advocates. One training will be provided during
this grant cycle. (Another training will be provided in Year 3.)
Foundation to Provide Sexual Assault Patient Care in the Emergency Room: This one-day training is for
emergency room nurses, mid-level providers, physicians, law enforcement, advocates, and first responders on
best practices for the multidisciplinary approach to caring for sexual assault patients. Ten trainings will be
provided during this grant cycle.
Adult/Adolescent Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) Training: This 40-hour training is for registered
nurses, mid-level providers, and physicians who provide medical-forensic examinations to sexual assault
patients. Attendees must be licensed in good standing, have a minimum of one year of clinical experience,
acknowledge the requirements of the training, and complete 16 hours of online training prior to taking the class.
Three trainings will provided during this grant cycle.

the age of 18. Attendees must be licensed in good standing, have a minimum of one year of clinical experience,
acknowledge the requirements of the training, complete 14 hours of online training and homework prior to the
first class, and have a mentor who has received specialized training in the care of both acute and non-acute
sexual assault patients and performs exams on a routine basis. One training will be provided during this grant
cycle.
Advanced SANE Training; This eight-hour training is for the practicing SANE or nurses who have completed
either the 40-hour Adult/Adolescent didactic SANE training or the 40-hour Pediatric/Adolescent didactic SANE
training. This training will cover a topic essential to the SANE Nurse at a higher level of understanding than
was provided during the Adult/Adolescent and Pediatric/Adolescent training. One training will be provided
during this grant cycle.
Adult/Adolescent SANE Clinical Training: This two-day training is for medical professionals who have
previously completed a 40-hour didactic Adult/Adolescent SANE training. This training will provide clinicians
with classroom and hands-on experience. Clinicians will be monitored throughout the training by medical
professionals who are certified as either SANE-A or AFN-BC. Two trainings will be provided during this grant
cycle.
Year 3
Illinois Victim Assistance Academy (IVAA): Coordinated by the Illinois Office of the Attorney General, IVAA
offers a 40-hour course for victim advocates with two to five years of experience. Sixteen hours of training
occur online and the rest are classroom-based. The IVAA is an intensive course of study in victimology, victim
compensation, victims' rights and services, and issues specific to working with victims of crime in Illinois. This

training. This training will cover a topic essential to the SANE Nurse at a higher level of understanding than

with classroom and hands-on experience. Clinicians will be monitored throughout the training by medical
professionals who are certified as either SANE-A or AFN-BC. Two trainings will be provided during this grant
cycle.
Goals
The goal of IVAA training is to provide victim advocates with 1 ½ to 5 years of experience will refresh their
core competency skills, learn about substantive criminal law and procedure and new laws, learn about providing
services to specific populations and participate in a mock trial.
The goal of the Advanced Illinois Victim Assistance Academy is to provide experienced advocates with indepth training on the effects of trauma on the brain and how that knowledge can improve the provision of
victim services.
The goal of the SANE Program is to increase the number of practicing SANEs throughout Illinois. This goal
can only be achieved by a multi-faceted approach to the educational needs that exist throughout different
regions and professions.
The eight-hour Foundation to Provide Sexual Assault Patient Care in the Emergency Room training gives law
enforcement, advocates and healthcare providers a better understanding of the extensive needs that a sexual
assault patient has when they seek emergency room care. This basic training is a great opportunity for
healthcare providers to gain knowledge about SANEs and determine if becoming a SANE is a profession that
they would like to pursue.
The Adult/Adolescent and Pediatric/Adolescent 40-hour didactic SANE trainings are the first steps to becoming
a practicing SANE. Once healthcare providers complete the 40-hour didactic training, they then begin to work
on their clinical training requirements. The Illinois SANE Program and other SANE training programs
throughout the country have had low completion rates;.prior to 2015, only 13 percent of nurses that attended the
didactic training completed their clinical training.
With the addition of the two-day Clinical SANE training, the number of clinicians submitting their clinical
training logs for completion has already increased. The two-day Clinical training allows healthcare providers
the opportunity to see and practice ano-genital assessments, specialized equipment utilization, and medical
forensic examinations with expert SANEs and standardized patients. This hands-on experience prepares the
clinicians to return to their hospitals with the skills required to practice as a SANE.

The Advanced SANE training provides the latest information on current practice guidelines supported by the
International Association of Forensic Nurses, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, A National Protocol
for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations Adults/Adolescents and Pediatrics, and the American
College of Emergency Physicians Sexual Assault Ebook. The Advanced SANE training will also focus on
moving SANE programs forward to provide services for other types of victims, including victims of
interpersonal violence, human trafficking, child abuse, and elder abuse.
Priorities
These trainings support the Authority’s priority of addressing the needs of victims and supporting their rights.
Funding Prospectus
The Authority expects to fund these programs for three years. The Authority aims to increase the number of
advocates in Illinois. As a result, there will be a continued need for these training programs over the three year
scope of the grant.
 
Past Performance
As this is a first-time funding initiative, no past performance can be measured.

VAWA FFY16 INTRODUCTION
The FFY16 VAWA award to Illinois is $5,253,742 with an expiration of June 30, 2018.
After setting aside 10 percent of the award for administrative purposes ($525,374), the
remaining funds must be distributed as follows: 25 percent of to law enforcement, 25
percent to prosecution, 30 percent to service providers, and five percent to the courts. The
remaining 15 percent can be allocated at the state’s discretion amongst the other
identified disciplines. A total of $4,728,368 is available for program purposes.

1. RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc
Committee to review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA
funds. The committee recommended using FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds to continue to
support programs previously funded through VAWA. The following are continuation
designations for previously funded VAWA programs deemed successful by staff. The
designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with
the priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY13-FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
A. Multi-disciplinary Team Response Programs
At the 2013 ad hoc committee meeting, multi-disciplinary team (MDT) response
programs were identified as a funding priority. In July 2015, the Authority sought
proposals for the development or enhancement of sexual assault or domestic violence
MDTs. Five of the eight submissions met the requirements and were recommended for
funding by the review panel. The projects began January 1, 2016. Initial awards resulting
from the funding initiative were for 12 months of activity with the possibility of up to 24
months of continuation funding based on satisfactory performance. Staff now
recommends designating continuation funds to entities and programs as described below.
All recommended continuation designations are for 12 months.
Staff will make recommendations for the final 12 months of funding based on program
performance reviews at a future date. Further details are provided in the attached Grant
Recommendation Reports.

B. Domestic Violence/ Sexual Assault Services
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) and Illinois Coalition Against
Sexual Assault (ICASA)
In the past, the Authority has designated all of each federal fiscal year’s allocated Service
Provider funds to ICASA and the ICADV in equal amounts. These funds were then
subcontracted to their program agencies for services to underserved areas or victim
groups.
Staff recommends that the Authority continue designating service provider funds in this
manner and that designations of FFY16 Service Provider funds in the amount of
$709,255 be made to both ICASA and ICADV.
C. Centralized Training for Chicago Area Domestic Violence Agencies
Each quarter, the Chicago Metropolitan Battered Women’s Network provides five 40hour domestic violence training services to between 25 and 35 service providers and 15
advanced and specialized training services to between 150 and 200 service providers.
Staff recommends a designation of $21,194 in FFY10 discretionary funds to the Chicago
Metropolitan Battered Women’s Network to continue this program for an additional 12
months.

Program Description
MDT programs are designed to bridge the gaps in service for victims of domestic violence
through the establishment and implementation of model protocols and model guidelines to
enhance the criminal justice response to victims. MDT programs are multi-disciplinary and
require, at minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service
agencies; and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine
the operation of team response to victims.
Program Activities
The overall focus of this Domestic Violence MDT expansion project are to identify households
that are at high-risk for future violence, proactively connect families to services, strengthen
investigation and prosecution of domestic violence offenders, provide inter-disciplinary
trainings, and to conduct ongoing self-evaluation to ensure that our pilot program continues to
benefit victims of domestic violence in the communities served.
The MDT partners will be responsible for ongoing monthly case reviews identifying trends from
case reviews that inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long
term planning and assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to
the MDT approach for addressing domestic violence in the City of Chicago. Various cases will
be reviewed, including cases where charges were not filed, cases that have reached disposition
and cases that have ongoing involvement with Adult Probation. During case review, team
members will have the opportunity to discuss what other evidence may have been considered,
what other questions may have been included in the victim and witness interviews, what other
sanctions may have been effective in terms of sentence and court monitoring as well as
additional services that could have proved beneficial to the survivor. These meetings will be led
by the designated Assistant State’s Attorney on the project and will be confidential in nature.

leadership as well as a broad based multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach through the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) Sexual Assault Advisory Group. The core team will
function as a steering committee for the project and will be made up of the SAO, Rape Victim
Advocates (RVA), Chicago Police Department (CPD), The Cook County Probation Department,
Life Span and a designated SANE Nurse. This team will be responsible for ongoing monthly
case reviews (led by the Assistant State’s Attorney), identifying trends from case reviews that
inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long term planning and
assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to the MDT approach
for addressing sexual assault in the City of Chicago with a primary area of focus on Area North.
This core team will be responsible for ensuring a proactive, results-oriented process that
purposefully achieves the goals of the MDT model.

The success of the Kankakee County Sexual Assault and Stalking Response Team (SART)
lies within the responsibilities of its core funded and match funded team members who meet
monthly to discuss issues related to sexual assault and stalking, problem solve, conduct case
reviews, network to build relationships and explore training needs. The focus of the Kankakee
County SART is to heighten sensitivity to victims of sexual assault and stalking while
improving the initial response, evidence collection, victim interviews, victim referrals, and
prosecution and conviction rates. The SART follows the Model Guidelines for Sex Crimes
Investigation Manual for Illinois Law Enforcement which has been updated and expanded on
to accommodate each discipline participating in the SART.

Program Activities
The Peoria County Domestic Violence Multi-Disciplinary Team (PCDV-MDT) is a
coordinated community response to domestic violence in Peoria County. The PCDV-MDT
will be comprised of 17 funded and match positions which will be utilized to assist victims
and deal with domestic violence offenders. The PCDV-MDT has team members co-located
in downtown Peoria, at The Peoria County Family Justice Center. Located across the street
from the Peoria County Courthouse, it co-locates partner agencies creating a confidential,
secure, neutral "One Stop Shop" for victims of domestic violence to access to receive
services and emotional support. The PCDV-MDT initiates contact with victims of domestic
violence as soon as possible after the incidents occur. From the time the domestic violence
occurs, until resolution of the case in civil or criminal court, as well as for the duration
offenders are participating in domestic violence counseling, or on probation, the PCDVMDT provides extensive one on one follow up to victims of domestic violence in Peoria
County. The PCDV-MDT also actively network with community agencies to assist victims

Program Description
MDT programs are designed to bridge the gaps in service for victims of domestic violence
through the establishment and implementation of model protocols and model guidelines to
enhance the criminal justice response to victims. MDT programs are multi-disciplinary and
require, at minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service
agencies; and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine
the operation of team response to victims.
Program Activities
The overall mission of this Domestic Violence MDT expansion project is to strengthen
investigation and prosecution of domestic violence offenders, provide inter-disciplinary
trainings, and to conduct ongoing self-evaluation to ensure that our pilot program continues to
benefit victims of domestic violence in the communities served. The MDT will put in place a
dramatic expansion of both funded and unfunded partners, including Call for Help, Inc., the
Illinois Department of Corrections, Regional Board of Education, Corrective Solutions, St. Clair
County Juvenile Justice Council, St. Clair County Elder Justice Council, East St. Louis Housing
Authority, local colleges and universities, and law enforcement associations.
Through this program expansion, the State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) will, for the first time,
incorporate sexual assault and related offenses into the MDT grant. All misdemeanor classified
sexual offenses will be transferred to the courtroom that previously only handled domestic
violence and violations of orders of protection misdemeanors to facilitate the targeted
prosecution by attorneys specifically trained in the unique aspects of prosecuting sex crimes.

Additionally, a comprehensive training program by prosecutors will be implemented by the SAO
for law enforcement agencies throughout the county on the protocols of investigating cases of
this nature. In addition, law enforcement training will incorporate a partnered approach with
Violence Prevention Center staff and Call for Help, Inc. staff to afford victims of domestic and
sexual violence immediate services whenever possible, which is critical to not only the victims’
safety, but also their continued cooperation in the prosecution of cases.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:
Services for Underserved Areas or Victim Groups
Funding Source:
FFY16 VAWA, $709,255, Match N/A
Program Description
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to
review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The VSAHC recommended that
FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to support programs previously funded through
VAWA. In the past, the Authority has designated all of each federal fiscal year’s allocated Service Provider
funds to ICASA and the ICADV in equal amounts. These funds were then subcontracted to their program
agencies for service to underserved areas or victim groups.
The following are continuation designations for previously funded VAWA programs which staff deem
successful. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.

Program Activities
ICADV is requesting STOP VAWA funds to support the continuation of 16 local domestic violence programs
that are currently implementing VAWA funded projects. These subrecipients will maintain or secure
approximately 15.7 full-time equivalent employees to execute goals and objectives as described in this
narrative. The projects address the needs of three categories of underserved victim groups: rural women,
Latinas, and chemically dependent victims. Funded projects will provide:
• Crisis intervention
• Legal advocacy and safety planning
• Individual and group counseling
• Access to safe housing
• Information and referral
• Assistance in utilizing other community resources
• Outreach and education in the targeted communities
• Institutional advocacy, particularly in law enforcement and civil and criminal courts
• Culturally appropriate support (for Latinas)
• Translation and assistance with documentation, self-petitioning and immigration issues (for Latinas)
• Collaborative work with substance abuse agencies (chemical dependency projects)

 VAWA FFY16
November 17, 2016

Goals
Developing, enlarging, or strengthening victim services programs, including sexual assault, domestic violence,
and dating violence programs, developing or improving delivery of victim services to underserved populations,
providing specialized domestic violence court advocates in courts where a significant number of protection
orders are granted, and increasing reporting and reducing attrition rates for cases involving violent crimes
against women, including crimes of sexual assault and domestic violence.
During the first three quarters, the funded projects served approximately 1,189 clients with 2,907 hours of
service. With 75 percent of the grant year completed, the projects have exceeded their objective for clients
served and provided 69 percent of the projected client service hours.
Priorities
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) to
review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The VSAHC recommended that
FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to support programs previously funded through
VAWA.
Funding Prospectus
As per the VSAHC funding for these core services is expected to continue. The program provided essential
services to underserved areas of the state for victims of sexual assault.
Past Performance
There have been no programmatic or reporting concerns during the past reporting period.
Budget Detail

Contractual: To subcontract with ICASA centers who have developed satellite services for
underserved areas or victim groups.

review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The VSAHC recommended that
FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to support programs previously funded through

funds to ICASA and the ICADV in equal amounts. These funds were then subcontracted to their program
agencies for service to underserved areas or victim groups.
The following are continuation designations for previously funded VAWA programs which staff deem
successful. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.

Program Activities
These funds will be used to support the continuation of 14 satellite offices of sexual assault programs and core
services in two developing sexual assault crisis centers. In order to broaden the availability of sexual assault
crisis services throughout the state, ICASA has used VAWA funds to support these satellite programs since
FY96. The support to new centers has occurred more recently to establish rape crisis centers where none
previously existed. The satellite offices and new centers are located in previously unserved geographical areas
or underserved neighborhoods.
Services provided by satellite programs include a minimum of a 24-hour hotline and 24-hour access to
individual medical and criminal justice advocacy. The primary focus of these offices is to provide these 24-hour
crisis counseling and advocacy services. Additionally, the satellite offices provide on-going counseling,
professional training, prevention services, institutional advocacy and information and referral.

Goals
During SFY 2015, 1,239 clients were served at the 14 satellite offices and two developing centers. Of these
clients, 88 percent were female. The client population was 76 percent white, 18 percent black and 20 percent

Hispanic or Spanish. Of the 1,239 clients served, 40 percent were under age 18, 27 percent were 18 to 29, 15
percent were 30 to 39, 10 percent were 40 to 49, and 7 percent were 50 and older. One hundred clients disclosed
some disability (e.g. vision impairment, deaf/hard of hearing, physical disability, cognitive disability, mental
illness). Centers served 102 clients whose primary language is Spanish and 106 with limited English
proficiency.
VAWA-funded staff provided 5,820.82 hours of direct service to victims of sexual assault and their significant
others during SFY 2015. A total of 3,982.49 hours were counseling, and 1,515.90 hours were advocacy.
Another 168.78 hours were devoted to non-client crisis intervention. Staff also provided 1,312.10 hours of
institutional advocacy and 168.90 hours of professional training.

Priorities
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the VSAHC to review past priorities and define new ones
for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The VSAHC recommended that FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used

In 2014, the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council (IFVCC) under the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority was awarded renewal funding through the US
Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women Grant to Encourage Arrest and
Enforcement of Orders of Protection. This grant amount is $900,000, and the grant period
is from October 2014 through September 30, 2017. On December 5, 2014 the ICJIA
Budget Committee approved a designation for this funding.

Recommended Designations
To date, the IFVCC and Local Family Violence Coordinating Councils (LFVCCs) have
created a training curriculum and provided training on the existing protocols (domestic
violence, elder abuse, and abuse against people with disabilities) for law enforcement and
prosecutors. They have also developed training toolkits for First Responders (emergency
medical personnel) and Court Personnel (probation, court security and circuit clerks),
which have been distributed statewide through the local FVCCs. Pre and post-test
evaluations and training team surveys have been developed and distributed to LFVCCs to
evaluate these protocol and toolkit trainings. In addition, the IFVCC Statewide Arrest
Advisory Committee created a work group to discuss the increasing need to engage
military personnel.
The Authority is requesting permission to increase funds and extend current grants for
salary support and training costs so that the IFVCC and local councils can update the
existing protocols; provide continued training on protocols and toolkits; and conduct
training follow-up and training evaluation activities.
These funds will also allow IFVCC to create a statewide resource directory for military
personnel; develop webinars that address family violence issues in military families; and
create a veterans court workgroup to develop recommendations on family violence cases
in the criminal justice system and veterans courts. Local councils will disseminate the
resource directory, engage local military personnel, engage and invite local military
personnel to join local Arrest Grant Training Teams, and participate in and invite local
military and criminal justice personnel to participate in webinars.
IFVCC programs have been funded from April 1, 2014 through March 31, 2017 for the
entities described in the table below. Staff recommends designating $233,400 in
additional FFY14 funds, as described in the table below in the Year 3 /SFY17 Column, to
allow these programs to continue through September 30, 2017.

Program Summary (State the intent of the program, the target population and intended consequences. Briefly
summarize what will be done. Who will do it? How it will be done? Where? When?):
The Illinois Integrated Protocol Initiative is funded by OVW through the Grants to Encourage Arrest and
Enforcement of Protection Orders program (FFY14 award). The 23 Local Family Violence Coordinating
Councils and 2 additional contracts (Macon Resources/Blue Tower Training and the Illinois Law Enforcement
Training and Standards Board) were previously funded by OVW through the Grants to Encourage Arrest and
Enforcement of Protection Orders program (FFY11 award). The funds requested on this recommendation are to
allow the grantees/contractors to continue expand upon the work from the FFY11 grant and the first year of the
FFY14 grant.
The IFVCC Integrated Protocol Initiative (IPI) has as its goal the statewide adoption and implementation of
protocols for law enforcement, prosecution, and victim services on domestic violence, elder abuse, and abuse
perpetrated against women with disabilities. The renewal FFY14 grant allows this work to continue and expand
to working with emergency medical services, 911 personnel, probation, and court personnel. Additionally,
evaluation will be done to measure the effectiveness of the protocol trainings that occurred in the prior grant.
This goal will be achieved through utilization of the existing statewide Illinois Family Violence Coordinating
Councils and local Councils in 12 judicial circuits, to provide localized training and technical assistance for the
adoption and implementation of each of the protocols. Through this process it is anticipated that the formal and
informal relationships among the systems (criminal justice, social services, law enforcement, etc.) will be
strengthened with the resulting improvement in response for victims, including an increase in arrests and
prosecutions.
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Goals for the Program (Goals are a broad statement of what will be achieved.)
The IFVCC Integrated Protocol Initiative (IPI) has as its goal the statewide adoption and implementation of

Evidence Based / Promising Practices (Describe briefly any EBP/PP incorporated within your program
strategy)
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils and the Illinois Integrated Protocol Initiative is based on
the Coordinated Community Response model for addressing violence against women. “Since 1995, The
Violence Against Women Act has provided grants that support a wide range of activities that emphasize “a
coordinated community response from advocacy organizations in partnership with the criminal justice system
[as] critical to reducing violent crimes of violence against women and enhancing victim safety and offender
accountability.” Program Overview, Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcement of Protection Orders
Program, Office on Violence Against Women http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/arrest_grant_desc.htm
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Designations were approved for the first two years of funding (April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2017). Grants
will be amended to extend the grant period to September 30, 2017 and to add these funds to each grant.
Costs will be determined based on the individual circuit’s needs. Generally the funds may pay for the time of a
part-time coordinator, materials for trainings, meetings and outreach activities, travel for the coordinators,
stipends for victim service programs, trainings and/or other supportive costs for the individual councils.

RE:

FFY16 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Sexual Assault Service
Program (SASP) Plan Introduction

This memo describes the VAWA SASP FFY16 Plan Introduction.
VAWA SASP FFY16 INTRODUCTION
The FFY16 VAWA SASP award to Illinois is $533,742, with $26,687 set aside for
administration purposes. The designations recommended in this memo and future designations
will be consistent with the priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY14 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATION
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee
(VSAHC) to review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA funds. The
VSAHC recommended that FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to
support programs previously funded through VAWA. The following are continuation
designations for previously funded VAWA programs which staff deem successful. The
designations recommended in this memo and future designations will be consistent with the
priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY13 – FFY16 Multi-Year Plan.
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA): The Sexual Assault Services Formula Grant
Program (SASP Formula Grant Program) directs grant dollars to States and Territories to assist
them in supporting rape crisis centers and other nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations that
provide core services, direct intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual assault.
Rape crisis centers and other nonprofit organizations such as dual programs providing both
domestic violence and sexual violence intervention services play a vital role in assisting sexual
assault victims through the healing process, as well as assisting victims through the medical,
criminal justice, and other social support systems. As in previous years, staff recommends that
the FFY16 VAWA SASP award’s grant-use funds ($507,055) be designated to ICASA to be
subgranted to ICASA’s partner agencies through a request-for-proposals process.
Due to the delayed receipt of this federal award, staff requests that this designation be made
retroactive to August 1, 2016. Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

Program Summary (State the problem and supporting data; identify target population and intended
consequences)
The Sexual Assault Services Program (SASP) was created by the Violence Against Women and Department of
Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005, and is the first Federal funding stream solely dedicated to the provision of
direct intervention and related assistance for victims of sexual assault. Women and men of all ages, as well as
children, can be victims of sexual assault. The perpetrator can be a relative, acquaintance or a stranger. Nearly
half of all women and one in five men have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime. Also,
nearly one in five (18.3 percent) women and one in 71 men (1.4 percent) in the U.S. have been raped at some
time in their lives.
For many victims, it may take years to recover from the physical and psychological trauma caused by rape and
other forms of sexual violence. To heal from the trauma, survivors often need support from family and friends,
as well as critical direct intervention and related assistance from victim-centered social service organizations
such as rape crisis centers, through 24-hour sexual assault hotlines, crisis intervention, and medical and criminal
justice accompaniment.
SASP directs grant dollars to states to assist them in supporting rape crisis centers that provide core services,
direct intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual assault. Rape crisis centers and other nonprofit
organizations such as dual programs providing both domestic violence and sexual violence intervention services
play vital roles in assisting sexual assault victims through the healing process, as well as assisting victims
through the medical, criminal justice, and other social support systems. Funds provided through the SASP
program are designed to supplement other funding sources directed at addressing sexual assault.
In Illinois, VAWA SASP funds are distributed to local sexual assault service providers through an interagency
agreement between the Authority and the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA). Under the SASP
program, ICASA will make funds available to 32 member agencies for the provision of hotline, advocacy,
counseling and outreach services to adults and children. The funded agencies will be selected through a
competitive application process in which applicants will be evaluated based on demonstrated need in the service

DESIGNATION REDUCTION
At the May 12, 2016 Budget Committee meeting, the Budget Committee designated $80,084 to
the Prospect Heights Police Department to continue its Law Enforcement Prosecutor-Based
Victim Assistance Services program. The current grant program performance period ends on
May 31, 2017. Staff recommends rescinding this designation because awardees of a new Request
for Proposals for Law Enforcement Prosecutor-Based Victim Assistance Services programs will
receive funding by July 1, 2017 and it is not clear at this time that Prospect Heights PD will be
among those recipients.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
At the 2013 Victim Services Ad-Hoc Committee (VSAHC) planning meeting, Multi-disciplinary
Team (MDT) Response Programs were identified as a funding priority. In July, 2015, the
Authority issued a Request for Application (RFA) seeking proposals for the development or
enhancement of sexual assault or domestic violence MDTs. The approved projects began
January 1, 2016. Staff recommends designating funds to entities and programs as described
below. These designations are for 12 months of continued activity with the possibility of another
12-month continuation based on satisfactory performance. Further details are provided in the

Program Description
MDT programs are designed to bridge the gaps in service for victims of domestic violence
through the establishment and implementation of model protocols and model guidelines to
enhance the criminal justice response to victims. MDT programs are multi-disciplinary and
require, at minimum, the involvement of prosecutors; law enforcement; probation; victim service
agencies; and an MDT Coordinator who convenes regular meeting of team partners to examine
the operation of team response to victims.
Program Activities
The overall focus of this Domestic Violence MDT expansion project are to identify households
that are at high-risk for future violence, proactively connect families to services, strengthen
investigation and prosecution of domestic violence offenders, provide inter-disciplinary
trainings, and to conduct ongoing self-evaluation to ensure that our pilot program continues to
benefit victims of domestic violence in the communities served.
The MDT partners will be responsible for ongoing monthly case reviews identifying trends from
case reviews that inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long
term planning and assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to
the MDT approach for addressing domestic violence in the City of Chicago. Various cases will
be reviewed, including cases where charges were not filed, cases that have reached disposition
and cases that have ongoing involvement with Adult Probation. During case review, team
members will have the opportunity to discuss what other evidence may have been considered,
what other questions may have been included in the victim and witness interviews, what other
sanctions may have been effective in terms of sentence and court monitoring as well as
additional services that could have proved beneficial to the survivor. These meetings will be led
by the designated Assistant State’s Attorney on the project and will be confidential in nature.

The Sexual Assault Multidisciplinary team will utilize a model that encompasses a core team for
leadership as well as a broad based multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach through the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) Sexual Assault Advisory Group. The core team will
function as a steering committee for the project and will be made up of the SAO, Rape Victim
Advocates (RVA), Chicago Police Department (CPD), The Cook County Probation Department,
Life Span and a designated SANE Nurse. This team will be responsible for ongoing monthly
case reviews (led by the Assistant State’s Attorney), identifying trends from case reviews that
inform practices of all agencies involved, identification of training needs, long term planning and
assuring that leadership from all agencies remain involved and committed to the MDT approach
for addressing sexual assault in the City of Chicago with a primary area of focus on Area North.

The overall mission of this Domestic Violence MDT expansion project is to strengthen
investigation and prosecution of domestic violence offenders, provide inter-disciplinary

dramatic expansion of both funded and unfunded partners, including Call for Help, Inc., the
Illinois Department of Corrections, Regional Board of Education, Corrective Solutions, St. Clair
County Juvenile Justice Council, St. Clair County Elder Justice Council, East St. Louis Housing
Authority, local colleges and universities, and law enforcement associations.
Through this program expansion, the State’s Attorney’s Office will, for the first time, incorporate
sexual assault and related offenses into the MDT grant. All misdemeanor classified sexual
offenses will be transferred to the courtroom that previously only handled domestic violence and
violations of orders of protection misdemeanors to facilitate the targeted prosecution by attorneys
specifically trained in the unique aspects of prosecuting sex crimes. Additionally, a

comprehensive training program by prosecutors will be implemented by the State’s Attorney’s
Office for law enforcement agencies throughout the county on the protocols of investigating
cases of this nature. In addition, law enforcement training will incorporate a partnered approach
with Violence Prevention Center staff and Call for Help, Inc. staff to afford victims of domestic
and sexual violence immediate services whenever possible, which is critical to not only the
victims’ safety, but also their continued cooperation in the prosecution of cases.
