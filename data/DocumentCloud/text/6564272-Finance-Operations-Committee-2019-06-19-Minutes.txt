4. Fentanyl Awareness Campaign
Beth Zietlow-DeJesus, Director of External Affairs, spoke to the devastating effects of the opioid crisis especially in the past
month and the deadly impact of the synthetic opioid, fentanyl. According to the Medical Examiner’s Office, she noted that
between May 20th and May 31st there were approximately 19 overdose deaths; half of this number were African American
males whose deaths were related to fentanyl being in cocaine.
Board staff recommends approval of providing collateral materials for grassroots distribution along with Fentanyl Test Strips,
purchased with funding from Cuyahoga County. Ms. Zietlow-DeJesus shared a sample of the materials produced that will
accompany the Fentanyl Test Strips to be disseminated throughout the community. Recommended radio spots targeting
African American and Hispanic males have been tentatively secured and vendors were asked to reduce the cost or provide
an added value in light of this serious epidemic.
Board member input:
▪ Rev. Gohlstin asked if Board staff could share a complete list of barbershops and other businesses that have
committed to accept the Fentanyl Test Strips so that Board members can also help to spread the word and not
duplicate efforts. Ms. Zietlow-DeJesus concurred.
▪ Mr. Shannon shared that recent efforts by the County have been made to simplify the messages for the target
groups and are working on TV spots; these messages will be ready soon for previewing and should be better
received.
▪ Rev. Gohlstin suggested contacting the station manager at WOVU for a potential of 3 free public announcements.

worked very hard to obtain the metrics reflected in the attachments to the agenda process sheet and will continue to do so
in the future.
With respect to Workforce Development, Ms. Rosenbaum noted that there are quite a few white papers on the subject of
workforce development in Cleveland and suggested that this would be a good place to start. Mr. Osiecki noted that both the
state of Ohio and the Board Association are interested in this topic. Jeffrey Johnson noted that the model to be used will
focus on outreach to provider agencies to learn about their hiring needs, barriers and/or challenges.

and the Vice Chair recommended Mr. Johnson due to his skills as practicing attorney and his political experience; it is felt
