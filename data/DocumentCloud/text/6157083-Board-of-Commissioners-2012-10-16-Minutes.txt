aforementioned guidelines must be returned to Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Director of the Cook County Board of Ethics is charged with determining compliance

source of controversy, misunderstanding and purported misuse; and

amended numerous times, and faces the recommendations of additional corrective action from the
Independent Inspector General by further amending said ordinance; and

appropriate funds for expenditures presently envisioned and permitted via the contingency funds; and

other reporting entities and will provide for greater transparency as the result of both more clearly defined
budgetary line items for Commissioners as well as the regular reports issued by the office of the
Comptroller; and

VOTEC CORPORATION (PROPOSED CONTRACT). Transmitting a Communication,
dated September 12, 2012 from David Orr, County Clerk by Clem Balanoff, Deputy County
Clerk and Maria De Lourdes Coss, Chief Procurement Officer:
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a
contract with Votec Corporation, San Diego, California, for implementation of an electronic
poll book system.
Reason:
A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued for electronic poll book and software
services (e-pollbook) via the Cook County website. Votec Corporation offered the best value
by meeting the requirements and offering the best price. They have extensive experience
with such implementations. The e-pollbook is a software application residing on personal
computing hardware, built with data from the Cook County Election Division’s voter
database. The application will help ensure that, in all precincts, voters are uniformly
processed by election judges, and that voters who appear at the wrong precinct can be
directed to the correct polling location, thus preventing disenfranchisement. Other benefits
include expediting of voter intake on election day and access to accurate, up-to-date voter
history and turnout data. In addition, e-pollbooks enable us to electronically capture data
from the polling place, including data on affidavit and provisional voters, election judge
timekeeping reports, statements of ballots and survey information. Further, the e-pollbook
provides a two-way instant communication platform with our office to help the judges better
administer the election. In addition to these benefits cost savings will be realized in the
following areas: printing, election morning deliveries of updated lists of early/mail voters to
each precinct, and personnel costs associated with manually updating voter history postelection. The total contract amount is funded in its entirety by Help America Vote Act
(HAVA) and other grant funds.

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
90

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 16, 2012

Transmitting a Communication, dated September 25, 2012 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $16,000.00 from Account
335-245, Advertising for Specific Purposes to Account 335-268, Court Reporting, Steno or Transcription
Services for court reporting and transcription services.
Reason:

Funds are needed to satisfy operational needs for court reporting and transcription services
for the remainder of the fiscal year.

From Account 335-245

Total

$16,000.00

To Account 335-268

Total

$16,000.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On August 22, 2012 it became apparent that Account 268-Court Reporting, Steno or Transcription
Services would require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations. At that time the
balance in the account was $13,894 and 30 days prior to that it was $24,515.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 245-Advertising for Specific Purposes was identified as the source of transferred funds as
the account is expected to have a surplus at the end of the fiscal year due to the excess savings
achieved from advertising through the Countywide Advertising Contract.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 335-245.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account 245-Advertising for Specific Purposes is expected to have a surplus at the end of the fiscal
year due to the excess savings achieved from advertising through the Countywide Advertising
Contract.

The Budget Department has reviewed and has no objection to this transfer.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook

Data Processing Equipment for two (2) months maintenance of the Kiosk System located at the Criminal

To Account 528-441

Total

$15,891.00

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On September 17, 2012 it became apparent that Account 441-Maintenance and Repair of Data
Processing Equipment would require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations. At
that time the balance in the account was $116,188 and 30 days prior to that it was $163,602.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 440-Maintenance and Repair of Office Equipment was identified as the source of
transferred funds to Account 441-Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment as a
surplus is expected in this account at the end of the fiscal year as maintenance for equipment that is
no longer needed will not be renewed, hence, the availability of funds for transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 528-440.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account 440-Maintenance and Repair of Office Equipment was identified as the source of
transferred funds to Account 441-Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment as a
surplus is expected in this account at the end of the fiscal year as maintenance for equipment that is
