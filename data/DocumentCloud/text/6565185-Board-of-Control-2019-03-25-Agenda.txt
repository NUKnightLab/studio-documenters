V – OTHER BUSINESS
Item of Clarification
On December 17, 2018 the Board approved the following item. The Fiscal Officer asked during the
Executive Review Meeting and then again via e-mail if any of the 25k being requested will be used to pay
invoices for services provided in 2018 or is it all for services to be provided in 2019. Jeanelle Greene
responded on both occasions by stating the expenses were for 2019 only.
The Department used $9,000.00 to pay for invoices for 2018.
The Fiscal Officer would like the Department to clarify to the Board that expenses were for 2018 and 2019,
as it is important for the Departments to be clear on what additional funds are being used for when the
Board is considering items for approval.
BC2018-914
Department of Information Technology, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1200571 with iData
Consulting Services, Inc., for maintenance and support services on the Synapse Publisher Web Content
Management System for the period 8/20/2012 - 8/19/2019 for additional funds in the amount not-toexceed $25,000.00.
Funding Source: General Fund
31

 Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology, presented. Joseph Nanni asked if remaining
unspent funds for this amendment will cover services through 2019 and if another contract will be
submitted upon contract expiration. Nan Baker asked for clarification on the amounts paid in 2018 and
2019, as the materials provided to Board members indicate that $9,000.00 was used for 2018 expenses,
not $6,000.00 as stated in Ms. Greene’s presentation. Matt Carroll confirmed that the statement
regarding 2018 funds, provided to the Board members, reads $9,000.00, not $6,000.00. Joseph Nanni
asked for confirmation if 2019 funds were being used to pay 2018 invoices and asked Ms. Greene to review
and confirm whether the document detailing the expenses given to the Board was accurate or not.
Ms. Greene indicated these numbers were not accurate and restated that approximately $6,000.00 was
paid for 2018 services and the remaining balance of $19,000.00 would be used for 2019 costs; however
other funds may have been encumbered for 2018 services separate from the $25,000.00 amendment.
Matt Carroll stated that the materials say that the $25,000.00 was to be used for 2019 and that further
discussions may be held outside of the meeting since this item does not require a vote. Joseph Nanni
stated for the record, that the document provided to the Board members, appears to be incorrect and
conflicts with what was being stated in Ms. Greene’s presentation.
Mr. Carroll asked for further review of this matter and asked the department to provide a response to the
Board members confirming actual payment amounts made for 2018 and 2019 expenses. Andria
Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control, indicated that the amount listed in the materials provided to
the Board, which lists the 2018 amount as $9,000.00, was provided by the Fiscal Officer.
This item did not require a vote.

Department of Information Technology
This procurement is for access control on two openings at Courthouse Square to secure the TASC Offices
on the 5th Floor. An electric strike, CPU, dual reader module, and related equipment are being purchased
along with the installation. There is only one protective services officer assigned to the Courthouse Square
Building. The installation of these two card readers will provide a higher level of security for the TASC
employees and visitors to their office. The installation of the card readers provides a higher level of
security for those working in and visiting the TASC Offices. In addition, the card readers allow for
immediate disabling of cards of former employees without the need to change locks and reissue keys.
This is an expansion of the security system in Courthouse Square and throughout the County.
The installation of the card readers provides a higher level of security for those working in and visiting the
TASC Offices. In addition, the card readers allow for immediate disabling of cards of former employees
without the need to change locks and reissue keys. This is an expansion of the security system in
Courthouse Square and throughout the County. These recommendations are based upon reviewing
existing security architecture throughout the County. Having conducted interviews with departmental
stakeholders, drawings and schedules have been created, reviewed, and revised, resulting in the existing
proposal. Additional security staff could be added to the facility. However, this is cost prohibitive. Keys
could be issued, but this is inefficient and not cost effective and has potential to leave a larger security
issue if staff copy and distribute keys without being tracked. This will be used on the 5th Floor of
Courthouse Square.
An RFP exemption is needed as this purchase will be made off a State Contract. This procurement is
part of the capital plan whereby the County vacated leased space at the Marion Building. The initial
investment for this equipment is $3,459.01. Once year of repair/replace maintenance is included, per
the state term. Included with this purchase is a one-year repair/replace warranty.
Integrated Precision Systems, Inc. (IPS) is able to provide the needed Access Control solutions under
Ohio STS #800545 which expires on January 31, 2021. In order to provide consistency in the
management of the large enterprise networked security system, it is essential that a single vendor
provide and maintain any equipment that is being added to this system. Had another vendor been
selected, the County would be running multiple independent security camera systems. Such a decision
would have returned the County to the Balkanized nature of the security systems that are being
upgraded and replaced.
The cost, customer service level, systems knowledge, among other characteristics were considered in
evaluating the services and equipment provided by IPS. The equipment and services provided meet the
County standards for such equipment as defined by DoIT. Similar equipment was put out to bid in 2001.

Title: Office of Innovation & Performance; 2019 Approval of Alternate Procurement Method for Startup
in Residence Program
Scope of Work Summary
Office of Innovation & Performance requesting approval of an Alternate Procurement Method for the
Startup in Residence Program (STIR).
The STIR Program is run by City Innovate and works to connect governments with startups to solve
government-led civic challenges using a challenge-based RFP process. The challenge-based RFP process
includes two key innovations: 1) defining a project by describing pain points and goals rather than vendor
and solution requirements, and 2) building in time for a 16-week demonstration period after the
government selects a startup but before the RFP is officially awarded. The Office of Innovation &
Performance is requesting approval of this alternate procurement method for the STIR Program.
The STIR Program Year starts with selecting and scoping of challenges from government entities.
Government subject matter experts identify key challenges they are facing that have dedicated support
to move to solve. The government entity then works with the STIR team to properly scope the challenge
to include what may be accomplished during a 16-week project period. A key difference for a challengebased RFP process, from a typical RFP process, is government clearly defines the challenge but does not
create the proposed solution with detailed specifications.
In addition to identifying projects, each government prepares associated documentation for a formal
procurement process during this initial program phase. An RFP process is typically used for STIR projects,
with the two key differences included in the process. Issuing an RFP allows the governments to enter into
a contract with the startup at the end of the program if the solution build effectively meets the
government’s needs. In most jurisdictions, standard RFP language will need to be updated to include the
performance of the startup during the 16-week project period as a required evaluation before making a
final award of the RFP. As part of the agreement STIR will provide template language that other
jurisdictions have used in past cohorts to conduct these challenge-based RFPs.
Following the project and procurement identification process, government challenges from all
participating communities are collected, organized and posted electronically by the STIR team in a
challenge-based RFP. The challenge-based RFP is an open and competitive RFP process. The STIR team
recruits startup participants from across the globe to apply through their electronic system for the various
government challenges.
Following the closing of the RFP, STIR provides an online dashboard for government participants to review,
evaluate and rank startup participants that applied to solve the specific government challenges.
Governments are then provided an opportunity to interview top startups. The government entity then
selects a startup to work on the specific government challenge.
The challenge-based RFP process leads to a 16-week project period with the startup and government
entity. To start out the 16-week project period, that government entity and startup establish a scope of
work with objectives. Governments and startups then collaborate over the 16 weeks on user research,
design, build and testing of a solution to the challenge.

43

 At the end of the 16-week project period, if the objectives of the scope of work are met and if there is a
positive working relationship between the startup and government, the government entity then can move
into a contract for the solution to the challenge.
In Cuyahoga County, if the department decides to move forward with a contract with the startup, the
department will bring forward the approval of the contract to the appropriate approving authority based
on the contract amount. The contract will come forward as an alternate procurement method with this
item as the approval of the alternate procurement.
Funding
This item is for the approval of the alternate procurement method only. Funding for any projects would
be identified by the departments and brought forward as part of any contract approval.
