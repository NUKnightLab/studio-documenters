To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

Re:

FY 2018 Budget Update and Amendments through December 31, 2017

From: Lisa Mancini, Interim Financial Planning & Analysis Manager

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) ended its most recent fiscal quarter
ended December 31, 2017. Accordingly, a quarter ended report has been prepared to present
the current budget progress.
Analysis: This report contains the following for review and discussion.

 Water System - Interim Budget to Actual Report - Revenue Requirement Budget Basis
 Sewage Disposal System - Interim Budget to Actual Report - Revenue Requirement
Budget Basis
 O&M Category analysis

 O&M Contractual Services by Cost Center
 Staffing ‐ Budget vs. Actual (Annualized)

 Overtime by Major Budget Category analysis

 Budget Amendment Report

It should be noted that these interim reports have been prepared on a modified cash basis. This
means that revenues are accrued but many expenses lag in vendor invoice receipt and posting.
Other expenses, such as shared services have been accrued.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Explanation
Not all budgeted FTE positions have been filled. See separate staffing analysis.
Utility bills are not posting in the month in which the service was incurred. Depending on the type of utility and the location of the meter,
the bills can lag anywhere between two to four months. Accruals have not been posted for utilities.

The actual bulk chemicals usage is lower than budgeted. It was recently determined that the FY 2018 budget was based on a period of
years where the chemical usage at the wastewater resource recovery facility was consistently high. This is being corrected going forward.
Invoices for expenses captured in the 'Supplies & Other' category have not been accrued. The time lag in posting can be from four to six
weeks. Accruals have not been posted.
Contracted Services invoices are not always posting in the month in which the services were incurred. On average the lag appears to be
two months. Accruals have not been posted. See supplemental schedule of contractual services by cost center.
Capital overhead policy being revisited (memo for Item #7D from 1.19.2018 Audit Committee meeting.) Budget may be further reduced in
3rd Quarter FY 2018. Additional resource and technology under consideration to improve project timekeeping.
An estimate for Shared Services activity has been posted based upon budget and preliminary review of shared services activity to date.
Capital Outlay items largely will occur in the second half of FY 2018.
Unallocated reserves have not been used or have a significant balance remaining in the account. See separate analysis related to
unallocated reserve.
Item under review.
Timing of projects under review.

 Great Lakes Water Authority
Budget Amendment Report
As of December 31, 2017
The purpose of this report is to present the Operations & Maintenance (O&M) budget
amendments that have been processed for FY 2018 from July 1, 2017, through December 31,
2017. This report contains two parts.
Part 1 - Budget Amendments Processed for FY 2018 thru December 31, 2017

The attached document contains a detailed listing of the O&M budget amendments that have
been processed for FY 2018.
 Many of the budget amendments recorded thus far have been reclassifications within
a cost center or operating area to improve assignment of costs.
 Several budget amendments (No. 7626, 7627, 7628, and 7965) have been recorded
to transfer costs to the newly formed Energy, Research & Innovation group. Prior to
the formation of this new group, the budget for this effort had been managed in the
Energy Management and Chief Planning Officer/Research & Innovation groups. The
Energy, Research & Innovation group was launched on December 1, 2017.
Part 2 - Analysis of Unallocated Reserves thru December 31, 2017

The table below identifies four categories of unallocated reserve by the four primary budget
areas. This table includes the FY 2018 approved budget amounts as well as the net effect of
the budget amendments as described below.

Unallocated Reserve – Centralized Services
There are two items that equal the $674,600 shown above.
 ($624,700) – The budget for Non-Personnel Capital Overhead Allocation is shown as
negative amounts because they are “contra” accounts which represent an offset to the
Contracted Services section of the O&M budget. The decrease represents a
realignment between O&M costs and Capital Program Expenses by taking into
consideration the percentage of time that a contractor is projected to work on capital
projects. A review of the FY 2018 budget for Non-personnel Capital Overhead
Allocation for the Asset Management (Centralized Services) group revealed that the
budget should be reduced for this line item. The resulting entry was to reduce (debit) the

 

Non-personnel Capital Overhead Allocation account and reduce (credit) the Unallocated
Reserve. (Budget Amendment No. 7671)
($49,900) – The cancellation of the Shared Services Agreement OPS-005 lead to a
realignment of the Security & Integrity (Centralized Services) budget for FY 2018. There
was a difference of $49,900 between the budget for the Shared Services and the actual
line item costs for this service. This difference was credited from the Unallocated
Reserve. (Budget Amendment No. 7061 and 8105)

Unallocated Reserve – Wastewater System Operations
There are two items that equal the $2,411,000 shown above.
 ($4,790,000) – As noted in the Unallocated Reserve – Centralized Services section,
above, a review of the Capital Overhead Allocation budget was conducted. In addition
to the adjustment to the Centralized Services area, an additional reduction to the Nonpersonnel Capital Overhead Allocation budget was made to the Wastewater System
Operations area. The resulting entry was to reduce (debit) the Non-personnel Capital
Overhead Allocation account and reduce (credit) the Unallocated Reserve. (Budget
Amendment No. 7670)
 $7,201,000 – A review and reconciliation of the revenue schedules have been
conducted. This resulted in the processing of a budget amendment to increase
revenues along with the Unallocated Reserve. (Budget Amendment No. 8106)

 AGENDA ITEM #8A

Date: February 23, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Andrew Sosnoski, Manager, Construction Accounting & Financial Reporting
Re:

Proposed FY 2018 Construction Work-in-Progress Review Schedule

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Financial Services Area established
the Construction Accounting & Financial Reporting (CAFR) team in calendar year 2017 to
better support GLWA’s capital program. A deliverable of that group is the quarterly
construction work-in-progress report (CWIP). The inaugural report was released in
September 2017 for the preliminary year-end June 30, 2017. Now that additional staffing
and business process improvements are in place, the CAFR team is establishing a cadence of
report delivery for the FY 2018 CWIP reports.
Analysis: Attached is a proposed CWIP report Gannt chart for FY 2018. The reports for the
first two quarters will be presented in consecutive months for a “catch-up” period.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.
