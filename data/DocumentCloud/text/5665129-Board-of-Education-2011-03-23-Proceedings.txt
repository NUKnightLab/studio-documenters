DESCRIPTION:

In June 2008. the Board authorized the use of $3.000.000 in unspent operating funds to charter
and contract schools in making their older independent-site campuses more accessible. especially those
campuses that were chosen before the Board began providing heightened ADA guidance to new school
applicants in 2006. Through a competitive application process. live charter organizations were chosen to
receive these ADA grants. The amounts of and conditions precedent to each grant were uniquely tailored
to each campus' particular accessibility challenges. but all grants required substantial contribution from
the charter organization.

Since that original award of grants. two of the grantees (Namaste Charter School and Chicago
international Charter School I Longwood Campus) have completed their accessibility renovations and
received their grant funds. One organization (UNO Charter School( determined that the cost of
making its Carlos Fuentes Campus accessible in the manner the Board required would be significantly
more expensive than anticipated. and thus deferred contracting until the Board could determine whether
additional contingency grant funds were available. The final two organizations (Academy of
Communications and Technology Charter School and Betty Shabazz international Charter
School (?Shabazz?). failed to meet the conditions precedent to their grant awards and. after several
extensions of time. their awards were rescinded by the Board in the spring of 201 o.

48

March 23, 2011

To date. the Board has spent $1 018.050 of the original 53.000.000 intended for this increased
accessibility. The remaining 31.981.950 was not spent under the previous Board authority. In order to
use these funds as originally intended. without disadvantaging any eligible organizations that might have
applied for and received this remaining money. in May 2010. the Office of New Schools and the
Department of Operations notified the same group of applicants as in 2008 of the availability of
Supplemental ADA Grant funds. Three school organizations submitted applications,

As in 2008, the applications asked for information about each applicant. including: a) demographic.
geographic, programmatic, and structural need for more access at the applicant campus. b) general
facility condition. long-term plans. and other factors relevant to the prudence of investing funds into the
campus; and c) demonstrated strength and reliability of the charter organization. especially with regard to
facility care. Each applicant was asked to propose ADA renovation plans and to commit to those plans if
grants are awarded. Each applicant was required to raise its own funds to cover a portion of its ADA
renovation plans. Applicants were required to provide documentation assuring the feasibility of the
construction and fundraising aspects of each plan.

A Grant Evaluation Committee. comprised of the Board's Director of ADA Policy. representatives from the
Office of New Schools and the Department of Operations evaluated the applications and made
recommendations that the supplemental grant money be awarded as described in the attached table
(Attachment A).

GRANT The term of each grant agreement shall commence on the date the agreement
is fully executed and shall and upon the expiration date specified in the agreement. or the completion of
all of the agreed-upon building renovations. whichever comes first,

CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATORS RESPONSIBILITIES: Each charter school operator Will be required
to comply with the ADA renovation plan submitted to the Board and to provide funding to cover a certain
percentage of the constructionfrenovation cost. Each charter school operator will also be required to

that any charter school operator that does not complete the agreed-upon ADA renovation pian within the
prescribed deadline will be re?tuired to repay to the Board all or a portion of grant funds expended

GRANT AMOUNTS: The estimated grant amount for each charter school operator is listed on
Attachment A. The total aggregate grant amount payable to all charter school Operators shall not exceed
$1,981.950.

AUTHORIZATION: Authorize the General Counsel to include other relevant terms and conditions in the
grant distribution agreements. Authorize the President and Secretary to execute the grant agreements

SCOPE OF SERVICES:

Consultants shall continue to provide professional services to the Board to implement the Board's
Development of Support for Instructional Services. The professional services will focus on building
capacity for powerful classroom instruction in our low-performing high schools. The strategy places
teacher improvement at the center and builds a holistic "Instructional Development System? that is
focused on specific course tools and facilitated by expert. ?exible coaching.

The goal of the specific course tools is to give teachers the concrete structure and materials they need in
order to put most of their energy into working effectively with students. and to enable teams of teachers
working on the same course plan to do concrete and effective lesson study together. The goal of
facilitation by expert and ?exible coaches is to enable a highly targeted teacher development process that
responds to needs in speci?c classroom situations and recognized the localized human development
aspects of instructional improvement. At a school leadership level. the overarching support mechanism
that an IDS provides will carefully integrate with department chairs. administrators and principals so that
their capabilities and interactions strengthen and the balance of external support at the school can
decrease over a three to five year period.

To build and implement this system of IDS network quickly and expertly. consultants are partners for two
(2) types of intensive. ongoing 3rd party help. Type 1 Consultants provide services for IDS
Development and implementation in English. Mathematics. and Science. Type 2 Consultant will
provide services for Assessment Development and Management. The following section summarized

consultant will be held accountable for implementing the following scope of work. for their specific IDS. in
close coordination with CPS:

designed holistically to ensure long-term student achievement as measured by the PSAE: each IDS will
take a meaningfully distinct and intentional instructional approach that may differ in content and skill
sequencing from another IDS in that subject area.

- Course Planning infrastructure: Type 1 consultants will also create planning guides that provide
appropriate unit and lesson structure with annotation to support best-practice instruction. including
instructional materials and equipment; should ?tell the story" of each course and drive an effective
balance of content coverage and deep cognitive still deveIOpment. The instructional materials and
equipment to support the science IDS will be presented for Board approval at a later time and will be
purchased in advance of implementation.

- Assessments dedicated to each course: Type 1 consultants are responsible for assessments that
carefully check for course-level skills and content. and include expert alignment to PSAE testing coverage
and methods: Summative pro-test. semester. and final exams. as welt as unit test designed to help gunde
instruction and course planning.

- Concrete professional development seminar: Type 1 consultants will offer seminars that are a
year-long series of sessions developed for each IDS ocurse. specific and dedicated to concrete course
requirements and issues. Sessions and workshops should serve concrete "next week. next month'
needs for teachers. and link effectively to the coaching process.

- Networking Opportunities: Type 1 consultants will create teacher networks that thrive within schools.
cniine and across schools using the IDS. to build effective connections. provide leadership opportunities
and develop exciting professional environment for teachers. These networks should play a key
best-practice brokering role as well.

The Type 2 consultant. American Institute for Research. will be responsible for scientifically scund
development of both summative ocurse and formative unit assessments. and for the Ongoing testing

infrastructure needed to support the IDS networks. .WW

The Board shall have the right to terminate the agreement with thirty (30) days written notice.

SCOPE OF SERVICES:

The Consultant shall provide services to the Board to implement Development of Support for Math
instruction Services. The consulting services will focus on building capacity for powerful classroom
instruction in our low-performing high schools. The strategy places teacher improvement at the center and
builds a holistic "instructional Development System" (IDS) that is focused on specific course tools and
facilitated by expert. flexible coaching.

The goal of the Specific course tools is to give math teachers the concrete structure and materials they need
in order to put most of their energy into working effectively with students. and to enable teams of teachers
working on the same course plan to do concrete and effective lesson study together, This additional math
IDS provides a rigorous mathematical curriculum which is less technologically intense than the two existing
math curricula. Adding such a curricula completes a set of choices from which schools can choose and is
consistent with district goals to include 8th grade algebra offerings within the IDS system. The goai of
facilitation by expert and flexible coaches is to enable a highly targeted teacher development process that
responds to needs in specific classroom situations and recognizes the localized human development
aspects of instructional improvement. At a school leadership level. the overarching support mechanism that
an IDS provides carefully integrate with department chairs. administrators and principals so that their
capabilities and interactions strengthen and the balance of external support at the school can decrease
over a three to five year period.

To build and implement this system within the existing IDS network quickly and expertly. the Consultant Will
partner with previously contracted and ongoing 3rd party help. The above named Consultant will provide
