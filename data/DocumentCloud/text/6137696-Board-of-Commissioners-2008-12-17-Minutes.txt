Cigarette tax imposed; tax stamps purchases; tax collection; un-mutilated or unaltered tax stamps; the unlawful sale of cigarettes, and tip line.

(a)
Cigarette tax imposed. A tax at the rate of 100 mils or $0.10 per cigarette is hereby
imposed upon all cigarettes possessed for sale and upon the use of all cigarettes within the County of
Cook, the ultimate incidence of and liability for payment of said tax to be borne by the consumer of said
cigarettes. The tax imposed hereby at the rate of 100 mils or $0.10 per cigarette shall become in force and

(b)
Tax stamp purchases. The tax imposed in this section shall be paid by purchase of tax
stamps from the Department, except as otherwise provided in Section 74-441(a) and (b) of this article.
The Department shall only sell Cook County cigarette tax stamps to cigarette distributors who are
licensed with the State of Illinois. It shall be the duty of every wholesale tobacco dealer, before
delivering or causing to be delivered any cigarettes to a retail tobacco dealer in the County of Cook to
purchase from the Department a tax stamp for each package of cigarettes and to cancel said stamps prior
to the delivery of such cigarettes to any retail tobacco dealer in the County of Cook. Said stamps shall be
affixed and cancelled in the manner prescribed by rules and regulations of the Department. Any stamp
which is defective or unused may be returned to the Department by a wholesale tobacco dealer, who shall

to purchase cigarettes from any person unless each package bears an unmutilated tax stamp affixed

provisions of this article.
(e)
The unlawful sale of cigarettes. It shall be unlawful for any wholesale tobacco dealer to
sell cigarettes to any person, other than to another registered Cook County wholesale tobacco dealer,
unless each package bears an unmutilated Cook County tax stamp affixed, or where the selling wholesale

A RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF HOWE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND
TINLEY PARK MENTAL HEALTH CENTER
WHEREAS, the Howe Developmental Center (Howe DC) in Tinley Park, Illinois is a home for 320
severely developmentally disabled individuals with complicated multiple disabilities and behavioral
issues who are unable to speak for themselves and require a voice in their support, and for whom
community placements are not appropriate; and
WHEREAS, Howe DC has small homes on a campus setting and offers extensive supports such as
psychiatric and behavioral services, 24/7 nursing care, access to medical services on grounds and at the
University of Illinois Hospital, and on site medical and dental clinics, all of which are not readily
available in community group homes; and
WHEREAS, the Tinley Park Mental Health Center (Tinley Park MHC) in Tinley Park, Illinois provides a
safe and secure treatment setting for mentally ill individuals, including those who have no insurance or
who have exhausted their mental health coverage, for southern Cook County and the collar counties; and
WHEREAS, Governor Blagojevich’s administration has announced that it is closing both Howe DC and
Tinley Park MHC; and
WHEREAS, the administration says it will “redistribute” most of the residents from Howe DC to other
state-operated developmental centers, such as the Murray Developmental Center in downstate Centralia
some 250 miles away; and
WHEREAS, moving disabled individuals from their home and requiring families to travel great distances
to visit their loved ones will cause great harm and suffering; and
WHEREAS, shuttering Tinley Park MHC would dismantle a vital community resource that has taken
decades to develop, providing a well-staffed inpatient treatment center with professional and
paraprofessionals specially trained to serve patients suffering from very severe mental illness as well as
planning which links patients to community outpatient resources; and
WHEREAS, some 2,000 admissions annually to Tinley Park MHC are a clear indication of the great
need for its services, and the demand for services at the center; and

218

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 17, 2008
WHEREAS, there are no comparable alternatives to providing care to these populations in the south
suburban area, with services at community mental health centers structured to serve individuals who are
not in acute crisis while community group homes for the developmentally disabled are too under funded
and understaffed to handle individuals with complex needs; and
WHEREAS, without a strong, secure safety net for those most difficult to serve, too many individuals
will be lost to homelessness and incarceration; and
WHEREAS, Tinley Park MHC and Howe DC employ some 800 people in our region, and its workers
receive fair wages, good benefits and workplace rights.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby
states its opposition to the closure of Howe Developmental Center and Tinley Park Mental Health Center
and urges Governor Blagojevich to reconsider his proposal to close these facilities; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges legislators in the
Illinois General Assembly to support the continued operation of Howe DC and Tinley Park MHC; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered to Governor
Blagojevich, Senate President Emil Jones, Jr., House Speaker Michael J. Madigan, and all members of the
Illinois General Assembly who represent Cook County.

corresponding government agencies; and
WHEREAS, the proposed modifications include the following: Title – “Consolidated

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION
AGREEMENT AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 17, 2008 from
RAYMOND MULDOON, Director, Real Estate Management Division
authority is hereby requested to amend a License Agreement entered into as of June 1, 1999, granting a
license to Mr. Clyde Black, to use and occupy a portion of the County Building lobby at 118 North Clark
Street for the purpose of operating a shoe shine stand. The license fee established then was $300.00 per
month. The license was for an initial three-year term, automatically renewing each year thereafter unless
terminated on thirty days notice.
Over the summer months, Mr. Black fell behind in paying the license fee. He has indicated that his
business, which is always more depressed in the summer, has declined overall. Changing fashions
coupled with an economic downturn have severely impacted his business. Mr. Black currently owes
approximately $1,700.00 in back license fees.
Mr. Black has asked to re-negotiate the terms of his license agreement, based on financial hardship. He
has indicated that he cannot pay the arrearage and will not be able to pay the full $300.00 per month.
Based upon discussions with Mr. Black, and the belief that the service offered by his shoe shine stand is
an amenity to occupants of the County Building and the public, the Real Estate Management Division is
recommending that the arrearage be forgiven and that the License Agreement be amended as follows:
Licensor:
Licensee:
Location:

County of Cook
Mr. Clyde Black
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602

Term:

Three years, commencing 12/1/08, to be renewed thereafter annually unless
terminated by either party.

License Fee:

$10 annually (and other value consideration)

Space Occupied:

100 square feet (approximately)

Termination:

either party on 30 days notice; immediately by County in the event of default
by Licensee under the License.

Approval is recommended.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the License Agreement
Amendment be approved. The motion carried unanimously.
