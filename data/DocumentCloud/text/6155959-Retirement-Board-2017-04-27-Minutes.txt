Annuities to Widows [Summary pg. 23]

The Executive Director called to the Board's attention that in the calculation of the widow’s annuity
associated with deceased officer Charles Loving, it was learned that the date of birth reported by the
officer on his information form and retirement application was one year prior to the year of birth now
observed on his death certificate and birth certificate supplied by his widow. As a result of this incorrect
year of birth, his cost-of-living increase was paid a year in advance. The accumulation of this early
increase, along with all successor years in which the officer received one additional cost-of-living increase
above what he was entitled to, is $18,000.
After lengthy discussion, the Board directed the Executive Director to contact Mrs. Loving to discuss the
overpayment and a repayment plan and report back to the Board.
It was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Lappe that the Board approve the Revised
Annuity as detailed on page 20 and the Annuities to Widows as detailed on pages 21 and 22.

An update on the Fund Office Space was provided. The construction previously discussed/approved
will commence on the Monday following this meeting. Changes to the reception area, adding a
small conference room and other miscellaneous will be paid via the tenant improvement allowance
provided in the 15-year lease signed about a year ago. There are a few items that would be outside of
the tenant allowance and were not in the Fund’s operating budget for 2017. The items not covered in
the tenant allowance would be painting the Fund offices, with an approximate cost of $10,000, and
carpeting, with an approximate cost of $40,000. Both items have not been completed since 2005.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Lappe that the Board approve a $50,000 expenditure
for painting and carpeting in the Fund office space.

A the last meeting, correspondence from the Corporation Counsel on retired Sergeant Ray Ramirez
was distributed to the Board members and at that time the Board took no action. Subsequently,
Board counsel researched and reviewed the matter. There were three counts of indictments against
retired member Ray Ramirez; he entered into a plea agreement; and the offense was reclassified as a
misdemeanor. There were no convictions of felonies. Therefore, no action by the Board is required.

•

A widow, Cynthia Rickert has come forward. Her retired police officer husband, Robert W.
Rickert passed away March 12, 2017. He retired in 1987, and at the time of his retirement, he was
single and received a refund of his spousal contributions. He married Cynthia in 1989. Since the
marriage, he has not paid back the spousal refund to the Fund. The widow has sent a letter to the
Board requesting approval to pay the refund of the spousal contributions and thus receive a spousal
annuity. Under the statutes, an officer that receives a spousal refund at retirement has one year from
the date of marriage to repay the refund to the Fund and have the new spouse thus eligible for a
spousal annuity. After much discussion, it was estimated that Mrs. Rickert would be required to
repay approximately $20,000 to the Fund and establish herself as a surviving spouse. The Board
requested the Executive Director contact Mrs. Rickert and determine the ability to repay the refund.

•

The audit and actuarial review are underway. There are actuarial schedules that have been provided
by GRS, of which the City is requesting copies. Because the Fund is in the preliminary stages of the
review, the Board requested to delay providing drafts to the City. As far as presenting the results of
the audit and actuarial report, such results would not be available at the May meeting. The
Executive Director proposed there be a separate Audit and Actuarial Committee meeting sometime
in early June to discuss those results.

•

There are some new accounting pronouncements that were issued and require adoption by the Fund.
Staff has been working with Northern Trust (NT) to get the data to complete the necessary financial
statement disclosures. There will be a custodial charge, not budgeted, to obtain the necessary
information. Staff worked with NT and additional expenses will be charged in the next two quarters,
as the Fund does need to comply with the new GASB standard.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT CONCLUDED
All business concluded for this date, April 27, 2017, it was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by
Trustee Summers that this meeting be adjourned.
