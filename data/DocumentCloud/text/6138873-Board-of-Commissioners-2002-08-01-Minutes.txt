If any local services tax imposed by this Ordinance is not paid when due, the County

interest due. The Treasurer shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the existence of the lie n.
Such lien shall terminate unless the County Treasurer files with the county recorder a notice
of lien, within one year of such tax date. From the time of the filing, the amount set forth in
the certificate also constitutes a lien upon all property of the taxpayer then owned by him or
thereafter acquired by him in the period before the expiration of the lien. Such liens have the
same force, effect and priority as a judgment lien and continue for I 0 years from the date of
the recording unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. The County Treasurer may, at
any time, release all or any portion of the property subject to any lien provided for in this
Ordinance or subordinate the lien to other liens if he determines that the taxes are sufficiently
secured by a lien on other property of the taxpayer or that the release or s ubordination of the
lien will not endanger or jeopardize the collection of taxes.
If the owner of a mobile home upon which the tax has not been paid does not make payment
within 6 months afte r a lien has been filed, civil action may be instituted by the collector fo r
the amount of the tax, plus interest, penalties and costs. If sale of the property is ordered, the

I respectfully request that this report be received and filed by the Audit Committee.

Referred to the Committee on Audit May 21, 2002.
In response to Commissione r Quigley 's question regarding whether the drug fo rfeiture fu nds received by
the Sheriffs Office were pa rt of the Sheriff's budget, Jack Kelly stated forfe iture funds are not part of the
Sheriffs budget. He noted that funds received from the State from 1998 through 200 I totaled $ 1.6
million and federal contributions from the Department of Ju stice and Departme nt of Treasury for the
same period totaled $600,000.
In reference to o ld business on the same subject matter, Commissioner Hansen stated to date he had not
seen a written response from the Sheriffs Office relating to information he had requested at the February
27, 2002 meeting of the Audit Committee. At that meeting he said info rmation was requested regarding
the use of the Narcotics and Asset Forfeiture Fund on real estate or real estate improvements, and if Board
approval was received for a ny suc h improvements. He noted at the February meeting the Sheriffs Chief
Financ ial Officer, Mr. Jack Ke lly, had stated he would research whether approval was received and
provide a writte n response to the Chairman.
In response to Commissioner Hansen, Jack Kelly confirmed that fo rfeiture funds were used for two real
estate matters relating to storage facilities (one on county pro perty and one on forest preserve property).
He stated County Board approval had been received for the storage facility on county property at I 03rd
and Woodlawn ; howe ver, board a pproval for the facility used to store vehicles on forest preserve property
in Maywood was still under review.

2742

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 1, 2002

Commissioner Hansen again requested that a written response from the Sheriff's Office be submitted to
the C hairman regarding whether the use of the two storage facilities mentioned had received county and
forest preserve board approval. Chairman Daley also asked that information on the number, type and cost
of vehicles stored at the facilities be included in the Sheriff's response.
On a simi lar matter, Vice Chairman Goslin stated to date he had not received previously
information from the Sheriffs Office relating to inventory a nd reconciliation of the Narcotics
Forfeiture Fund. He stated his interest in reviewing this information was to assure there is
accountability in place for tracking the use of drug forfeiture fund s and inventory purchased
funds, in order to provide a means to review any additional costs to the county.

Chairman Daley requested that a written response from the Sheriff's Office be submitted to the Chairman
providing information on the tracking method used for Narcotics and Asset Forfeiture Funds, including an
inventory of property purchased with such funds.
Commissioner Butler requested a legal opinion from the State's Attorney's Office clarifying, under
federal and/or state law, who is authorized to receive and use drug forfeiture funds and assets.
Commissioner Hansen agreed with Commissioner Butler' s expressed concern regarding unknown risk the
county may be undertaking in terms of assets received through drug forfeiture cases and his request for a
legal opinion relating to who is legally authorized to receive and use drug forfeiture funds.
Commissioner Lechowicz suggested that members' questions should first be submitted to the County's
Auditor, Laura Burman, for a response or recommendation on how this Body should next proceed.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question on the process for selection of the auditor of these
reports, Mr. Kelly stated the work was competitively bid. Commissioner Lechowicz asked how long E.C.
Ortiz & Company had been handling this audit work. Mr. Kelly stated Ortiz performed the audits for the
past four fiscal years.
Commissioner Quigley made a brief observation on the audits of the State Drug and Forfeiture Assets
Fund for fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000 and 200 I relating to the auditor's observations and recommended
policy changes to the Sheriff's Office. He noted that the same concerns appear in each year's audit and
asked for an explanation of why the same management responses appear each year.
Mr. Kelly explained that before 1999, the State Police audited the funds, however since that time no
audits had been done. He said when he became the CFO for the Sheriff's Office in 200 I he had the four
years audited at one time, which is why the recommendations and management responses are the same.
He confirmed that to date all the recommendations by the auditor had been implemented.

Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 251947. The motion carried.

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, Dorothy Brown, transmitting a Communication,
dated June I0, 2002:
SUBJECT:

FISCAL YEAR 2001 INDEPENDENT AUDIT REPORT AND ITS
RELATED MEMORANDUM ON INTERNAL CONTROLS

2743

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 1, 2002

Please find the Fiscal Year 200 I Independent Audit Report and its related
Memorandum on Internal Controls for the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court.
Please accept these reports and refer them to the Cook County Audit Committee for the
appropriate review.

Referred to the Committee on Audit June 18, 2002.
In response to Commissioner Hansen 's question on page two, Estimated Payments-Management
Response, regarding the status of full recovery of overpayments, John Morales stated this issue resulted
from an initial problem with the conversion of the TRIM system. To date, he confirmed full recovery of
overpayments was complete.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page four, regarding the status of timely recording of
cash disbursements, receipts for reconciliation of journals and general ledger maintenance, Mr. Morales
stated with the exception of the suburban districts, the cash disbursement and receipt journals, payouts,
and general ledger maintenance had been implemented. He anticipated completion of the suburban
districts by the first quarter of FY 2003.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding if reconciliation is done daily online, Mr.
Morales said the suburban districts daily online reconciliation is an ongoing problem due to time
consuming manual checks to ensure consistency of reporting data. He explained those facilities and
cashiering systems are not yet linked to the County's financial management information system (FMIS)
through the wide area network (WAN).
Commissioner Hansen asked for more information on the J.D. Edwards Financial Management
Information System and what the problem was in getting the Clerk of the Circuit Court's suburban
districts linked to the County's WAN?
Tom Glaser responded first by complementing Mr. Morales on doing an outstanding job in addressing the
automation of financial records in the Circuit Clerk's office since his arrival in March 2002. He stated
over the past three months his office has been working with Mr. Morales on getting all the Clerk's offices
linked to the FMIS and WAN. He said a s ite license for the office was purchased and his office continues
to work with the Clerk's staff to ensure completion by the FY 2003 target date. He noted continued
cooperation from the independently elected officials is necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of linking
every county bureau and elected office to the FMIS in order to have an integrated seamless system that
everyone can use.
Commissioner Hansen made the observation that the Clerk of the Court should be one of the first targets
for the financial report extension, otherwise the office will continue to need personnel to work overtime
doing manual checks in order to meet the sixty day turnover rule of cash (from the time received) into the
integrated county-wide ledger system.
As a follow-up question on the integrated countywide ledger system, Chairman Daley asked if there was a
timeframe set for the elected officials to transition to the FMIS on-line through the county WAN system.
Tom Glaser responded there was no formal deadline initially given for transition to the system. He
explained the goal is to get the core functions, such as payroll, linked and stabilized before considering
additional applications to extend the system for an integrated general ledger system countywide.
Chairman Daley asked if any elected officials were on-line yet. Mr. Glaser stated only the Treasurer has
started transitioning to the J.D. Edwards general ledger system.

2744

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST I, 2002

Chairman Daley recommended that the Bureau of Finance work with the Chief Information Officer to
review if, and when, such a deadline should be set and then follow up with a memo countywide on the
transition procedure. Mr. Glaser stated he would follow up with Cathy Maras, who is responsible for the
coordination of the county' s computer information systems.
On the same point, Commissioner Hansen recommended a memorandum on the capital investment or
estimated cost for a fully integrated county-wide ledger system be submitted to the Finance Chairman for
further discussion by the Board. Tom Glaser stated the Bureau of Finance would do this.
In response to Commissioner Hansen' s question regarding management' s response on page five stating
the Circuit Clerk was awaiting a legal opinion from the State's Attorney ' s Office on when accounts
receivable related to NSF checks may be deemed uncollectable for the purpose of writing them off, Helen
Haynes from the State ' s Attorney's Office stated the legal opinion was given to the Clerk of the Court' s
Office last week.
Commissioner Hansen asked the County Auditor if she had received a copy of the legal opinion. Laura
Burman stated she had not received this information but if the Clerk had, she could work with it and
resolve the recommendations in the audit report.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Committee needed a copy of the opinion or information on how
NSF checks were going to be handled. Helen Haynes clarified that legal opinions are client related
material and since Clerk Brown requested the opinion, it was directed to her.
Commissioner Lechowicz pointed out that, as submitted, this audit report is incomplete. He noted there
was number of legal opinions requested, and stated in the future the State' s Attorney's Office should
provide the Chairman with complete information prior to discussion and action being considered by the
Audit Committee.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved to defer Communication No.
252593 until members receive complete information. The motion carried.

Cook County - 2000 Property Tax Extension and Breakdown Report dated February
20, 2002.

Submitted to the Audit Committee on March 29, 2002.
Commissioner Hansen made a brief observation on the 2000 extension of property taxes related to the
expansion of tax increment financing (TIF) districts. He suggested further review of the long-term impact
on the county budget since the number of TIF districts has significantly increased resulting in the levy
amount (or tax revenue) needed to make up the difference to increase and requiring approximately $25
million of additional County money . He also mentioned the impact on suburban school districts.
Commissioner Lechowicz commented that there is initially a revenue loss; however, if the Auditor was
asked in the future to analyze the fiscal impact and the long-term impact for the County, it would be
important to look at the long-tem1 economic benefits of TIF districts. He noted the City of Chicago has
used them for worthwhile purposes to stimulate employment and economic development in historically
blighted areas.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Item No. 5.
The motion carried.

Recorder of Deeds and Registrar of Titles - Financial Report dated February 21, 2002
of the Fee Accounts for the year ended November 30, 1999.

Submitted to the Audit Committee on April 29, 2002.
In response to Vice Chairman Goslin's question on page nine regarding the status and target date for bank
reconciliation completion, Darlena Burnett from the Recorder's Office noted that reconciliation is being
done currently. However, she stated the auditor's recommendation on bank reconciliation refers to the
new system that is underway to automate the reconciliation process.
Commissioner Hansen observed on pages I 0 through 22 there were many repeat recommendations with
no final sign-off and recommended written information be submitted to the Chairman from the Recorder
regarding what and when such items would be completed. Ms. Burnett explained that many of the items
are contingent on the implementation of the new accounting and cashiering system, but confirmed the
office would supply further information to the Chairman.

Commissioner Lechowicz, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved to receive and file Item No. 6.

Recorder of Deeds Financial Report, discussed at the February 27, 2002 Audit
Committee meeting.

Commissioner Hansen referenced a question that came up at the February 27th meeting on the estimated
cost of the Unisys system and implementation problems found with the system. He noted that it was
learned that Cathy Maras O' Leary was not involved in the RFP for the Unisys system, but at the request
of the Audit Committee, participated in looking at the scope of the project. As a follow-up,
Commissioner Hansen asked what procedures were in place now to ensure the County Board that before
an RFP for a computer or automation technology system goes out they have been checked by appropriate
agencies?
Chairman Daley said the President has instructed the Chief Information Officer to review all these issues,
but agreed with Commissioner Hansen that a further step may be needed.
2.

Countywide Investment Policy

Commissioner Hansen commented on the audit recommendation relating to a countywide investment
policy and how it still has not been developed or coordinated with the Treasurer's office. He asked for
comments from the Chief Financial Officer regarding the status of this recommendation.
Tom Glaser stated on-going discussions continue between the auditors and the County. He noted one
thought is that the County Board should have oversight over the C-fund, since the Treasurer invests the
operating funds of the County. He noted state statutes suggest the other school of thought, that being the
Treasurer has unilateral authority to implement an investment plan as she sees fit.
Due to what appears to be conflicting responsibility and authority, Mr. Glaser informed the Committee of
his response in the internal memorandum this year requesting a formal legal opinion from the State' s
Attorney in order to get some direction on how to proceed. Chairman Daley recommended seeking a
response from the Treasurer' s Office to the State's Attorney ' s opinion.
Commissioner Hansen suggested that the Auditor prepare a list of follow-up information or responses
requested to be submitted to the Chairman which can be placed on the next meeting agenda as old
business.

Commissioner Lechowicz moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
Respectfully submitted,

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 1, 2002

Commissioner Moreno stated that he thought it would be easier to give the properties back to the City of
Markham, wiping out the taxes, rather than having the taxes abated.
William E. Elston, Attorney for the City of Markham, stated that it is his understanding that PIN 29-18324-040 is eligible for the proceedings, although he agrees that PIN 29-18-324-039 may have some
questions. He indicated that the City of Markham is planning to file a friendly injunction suit to have the
taxes for past years vacated on PIN numbers 29-18-324-033 and 29-18-324-041 so they can revert to
ownership by the City. As to the other PTNS, he urged passage.
Troy Deckert, of the Cook County Department of Planning, stated that a title search revealed that only
two of the parcels are owned by the City of Markham, and the other two are tax delinquent and should be
withdrawn: 29-18-324-033 and 29-18-324-041.
Commissioner Moreno stated that it still did not make sense to waste taxpayer and City of Markham
resources to file a lawsuit to wipe out taxes. If the proceeding here is a no cash bid, the Board can return
the property and wipe out the taxes without the City of Markham having to go through the additional
steps.
Chairman Sims asked why the Board cannot go ahead and approve these two properties without the City
of Markham having to file a lawsuit.
Troy Deckert added that Pam Hughes of the State's Attorney's Office issued a memo that the current
procedure is that the city can get a judge 's order to wipe out the delinquent taxes.
Commissioner Moreno stated that he understands that the Markham-owned properties are delinquent
because no one filed for exemption. He asked why not give Markham the prope1ties, wiping out the taxes
through Board authority, thus saving them a lawsuit. He further asked for a legal opinion from the State' s
Attorney's Office.
Assistant State's Attorney Randy Kemmer responded that it is his understanding that there is a section of
the property tax code that allows municipalities to wipe out liens, but it depends on whether the property
was obtained by lien, or by tax deed process. The question is whether the Board could make bids on these
liens and then cancel the certificates and wipe out the taxes. He concluded by say ing that he believes the
County Board has authority to do this.
Commissioner Moreno stated that it was just brought to his attention that these two properties were
donated to the City of Markham.
Randy Kemmer clarified that if Markham chose to accept the donation, then they do in fact own the
properties. He stated it is then possible to wipe out the liens by the no cash bid process.
Chairman Sims clarified, and Troy Deckert confirmed, that Markham did not obtain exemptions.
Randy Kemmer inquired if the property was obtained through an annual or over-the-counter sale, then all
taxes are in effect paid through the sale.
Troy Deckert clarified that the properties were not bid for at a sale.
Howard Weitzman, Title Expert, Columbia Properties, stated that the properties were donated to the City
in 1985. The party did not pay the taxes and it was deeded to the City. He indicated that there are no
improvements, there are still trees and there are alleys or streets on the properties.

2750

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR AUGUST 1, 2002

Chairman Sims asked Randy Kemmer whether the Board could cancel Markham 's taxes at the Tax
Delinquency Subcommittee meeting?
Randy Kemmer responded that the entire Board would have to bid on the no cash bid and only after
owning the certificates of purchase, can they be cancelled.
Commissioner Moreno inquired whether anyone purchased the properties before they were donated?
Troy Deckert responded that the taxes were paid when they received the properties; they failed to pay the
exemption.
Randy Kemmer stated that there were two options, a no cash bid where by the certificates are cancelled,
and a lawsuit seeking an injunction.
Commissioner Moreno noted that the no cash bid was the better option in terms of saving the City of
Markham expense.
Randy Kemmer responded that the Board wou ld have to authorize such a bid and the bid would have to
be made by the City.
Attorney Elston commented that he agrees with Commissioner Moreno, that it would be more economical
for the City of Markham if the County bid on the liens.
Randy Kemmer stated that there have been previous instances, for example the Village of Dixmoor,
where tax liens were purchased by the County and then cancelled, thereby extinguishing the taxes.

Commissioner Moreno moved to amend the initial motion to include PIN Nos. 29-18-324-033 and
29-18-324-041 for approval.
Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved approval of Communication No.
249607, as amended except for PIN Nos. 29-18-318-039, 29-18-318-058 and 28-13-329-042. The

REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Finance Tax
Delinquency Subcommittee, submitting a request from Dr. Jrene H. Brodie, Mayor, Village
of Robbins:
Re:

South Suburban Tax Reactivation-Village of Robbins

I am requesting your assistance on behalf of the residents of the Village of Robbins in
securing tax delinquent property on a no cash bid basis. The Village of Robbins has a history
of severe property tax delinquency, and most of our vacant parcels are seriously delinquent.
We would like to convert these vacant and delinquent parcels into revenue generating land.
The Village of Robbins is also on the verge of beginning some much needed sustainable
commercial development. However, the Village owns little land to provide to developers for
these projects. Acquiring these parcels will allow us to move forward in the process of
securing development within the Village of Robbins.
