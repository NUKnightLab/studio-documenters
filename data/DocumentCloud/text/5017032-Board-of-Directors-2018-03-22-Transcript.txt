Actually, I will make

First, I want to welcome

23

everybody, the members of the public that are

24

here.

Thank you for coming, and we look

 Police Board Public Meeting - March 22, 2018

1

forward to hearing your comments and

2

suggestions.

3

It's always a good opportunity

4

for the members of the public to come here and

5

speak and for us to hear and for the Board to

6

hear as well, so we always welcome that.

7

And secondly, I want to thank the

8

police officers that are here.

9

of officers working and doing a great job for

10

us.

11

guys as well.

12
13

We have a lot

And for the ones that are here, thank you

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

Thank you, First

Deputy.

14

I will now call upon those

15

members of the public that signed up in advance

16

to speak.

17

When your name is called, please

18

step up to the microphone.

19

you to limit your comments to two minutes in

20

deference to the other speakers who will come

21

after you.

22
23
24

And, again, we ask

Our first speaker is Scott
Clayton.
MR. CLAYTON:

Good evening.

Thank you.

name is Scott Clayton.

I live in North

2

Kenwood.

3

members present, would you please stand.

If there are any other North Kenwood
Okay.

4

The reason I'm here, last Friday,

5

March 16th, at about 5:30, my neighbors noticed

6

five individuals trying to break into parked

7

cars.

8

minutes later, another neighbor, an 80-year-old

9

man was accosted by the same group.

That neighbor called 911.

About ten

They told

10

him they had a gun, and they wanted all of his

11

belongings.

12

survived.

13

neighbor was held at gunpoint in her own

14

garage.

15

Ten minutes later, my wife arrived home.

16

for the fact that she stopped at the Walgreens

17

to send an urgent e-mail, it would have been

18

her.

19

God bless his soul, he said no and

30 minutes later my next-door

Her car was stolen by the same group.
But

I'm a father of two boys, and I

20

coach.

One of the things I try to instill in

21

all my boys is personal accountability.

22

ask why I didn't play, ask what I can do to

23

make myself indispensable to you such that you

24

don't have an excuse.

Don't

going to say, I decided to take that approach,

what can I do?

5

response?

6

unheeded.

What can my neighbors do in our

Because the first two calls went

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

First Deputy, do you

want to address that question?
FIRST DEPUTY RICCIO:

I would have to dig

10

further to find out exactly what the

11

circumstances were.

12

I would say this.

A lot of times

13

it's what's told to the 911 operator that

14

determines how they're going to classify that

15

call, and then how urgent that call is going to

16

be when it's placed out to beat cars.

17

would really depend specifically on what was

18

said during that 911 call.

19

So it

I don't know that there's

20

anything that -- I don't know that there's

21

anything that you could have or should have

22

done differently nor the other people.

23
24

We would have to look into that
incident.

If I can get some of the specifics
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

9

 Police Board Public Meeting - March 22, 2018

1

after the meeting, I will be happy to do that,

2

look into it and give you some feedback.

3

I can just say, generally,

4

sometimes people are like a little reluctant to

5

kind of sound the alarm or to make it seem like

6

it's something they need help with right away,

7

and they kind of tone it down a little bit so

8

the 911 operator feels maybe this isn't

9

something that we have to send out immediately.

10

There may be other jobs they want to send out

11

ahead of it.

I would have to find out.

12

I can certainly listen to those

13

911 tapes, and I'll have somebody circle back

14

with you and get back to you and find out

15

exactly what happened that night and let you

16

know.

17

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

Can I suggest this,

18

First Deputy?

19

around until the end of the meeting, confer

20

with the First Deputy and give him specifics,

21

time, location.

22

Perhaps Mr. Clayton can stick

As we all know, the 911 tapes get

23

recycled every 30 days.

24

need to go down.

So that's a path you

You need to make a specific

10

 Police Board Public Meeting - March 22, 2018

1

request to OEMC directly to hold those tapes

2

while we figure out what the incident number

3

is.

There's ways we can get to that.

4

If there's something that's on

5

the tape that allows for a teachable moment, so

6

to speak, then, perhaps, it's the best way to

7

proceed.

3

Points Bulletin, who's not here this evening, I

4

am fighting alongside with you both.

5

for believing in me.

6

Thank you

The importance of this movement

7

is so that sexual assault, which means rape, by

8

police officers will stop in Chicago and all

9

over the world.

10

It is important for me, you, you

11

and even you, too, to fight for the statute of

12

limitations of rape by police officers or any

13

law enforcement officer to be changed from ten

14

years to no limitation at all.

The fact that there are so many

20

women who have been or are presently sexually

assaulted by police officers in Chicago and all

As I was preparing this speech, I

20

realized that I possibly

molested or sexually raped by their fellow

Good evening.

My name is

10

Shaina Landhuis, and I am a member of the

11

#TheyKnow, #PoliceToo, #NothingHappened

12

movement to address the police sexual assault.

13

I first want to say it's

14

ridiculous that it took two years to decide

15

what is going to happen with Officer Robert

16

Rialmo regarding the shooting of Bettie Jones

17

and Quintonio LeGrier.

18

We can't forget that it has been

19

six years from yesterday exactly that Rekia

20

Boyd was murdered by Officer Servin, and he was

21

allowed to resign with his pension.

22

This can't continue to happen.

23

Now, currently in Illinois, and

24

34 other states, it is not explicitly stated,

they can claim it's consensual.

How can this

House Bill 5597 would eliminate

15

 Police Board Public Meeting - March 22, 2018

1

have the authority to adopt a policy to say

2

that any police officers that engage in sexual

assault with anyone in their custody be fired.

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

Thank

Our next speaker is

Grace Patino.
MS. PATINO:

Good evening.

I'd like to

11

submit for the record HB 270, which became a

12

public act on September 22nd, 2017, and I'd

13

also like to read a section of it.

14

So Senate Floor Amendment No. 1

15

states, "Provides that upon receipt of an

16

allegation or complaint of an officer-involved

17

criminal sexual assault, a municipality with a

18

population over one million shall promptly

19

notify an independent agency, created by

20

ordinance of the municipality, tasked with

21

investigating incidents of police misconduct."

22

This went into effect January 1st, 2018.

23
24

Again, my question to you all is,
when will the City of Chicago be creating an
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

16

 Police Board Public Meeting - March 22, 2018

1

independent agency tasked with investigating

2

incidents of police sexual misconduct as

3

mandated by this enacted ordinance?

4

And lastly, I'd like to state

5

that the enactment of the CPAC ordinance would

6

create such an independent third-party to

7

investigate all issues of police misconduct,

8

including issues of sexual assault by police.

9

Yesterday marked the six-year

10

anniversary of Rekia Boyd's murder.

11

marked the nine weeks since Trina Townsend

12

first spoke to you about violence she faced

13

growing up at the hands of CPD.

14

Today

When will you address this

15

systematic violence that women of color

16

predominantly face in the hands of CPD?

 Police Board Public Meeting - March 22, 2018

1

people volunteer hundreds of hours to promote

2

an all democratically elected civilian police

3

accountability council.

4

The response of people all over

5

the City has been overwhelmingly positive.

And

6

so the CCPSA, Community Commission of Public

7

Safety and Accountability ordinance, that is

8

just going to be entered on the 28th, uses

9

language that suggests that it will be

10

democratically elected, but we all know its

11

function will be much more like the electoral

12

college.

13

the editorial college, I can say that.

14

And I don't think that people like

The fact that the language also

15

is so close to the CPAC ordinance but does not

16

contain anything solid enough to actually

17

create community control of the police I

18

believe is detrimental to the future safety of

19

the people of Chicago.

20

It has not gone unnoticed by --

21

that community members may mistake this new

22

ordinance for the CPAC ordinance.

will definitely go back out and make sure that

people know the difference between our

like the CPAC ordinance.

And we

school teacher, my baby's school teacher, and

12

she was my -- she's my daughter's grandmother.

13

So how can you get my name wrong?

fingerprints with another case that they wanted

me to go to jail, get out, miss my mother's

10

As some of you remember, last

week I asked how many of you are aware of three

12

instances where state crimes against democracy

13

were committed by people of power, but these

14

crimes are never solved or even investigated,

15

because our justice system has reached a crisis

prosecutors on the people, specifically like

2

officers like Jason Van Dyke who murdered

3

Laquan McDonald but is not being held to

account, because the FOP is spending who knows

5

how much taxpayer's money to ensure he is not

6

brought to justice, just as no police officer's

7

been brought to justice for the murder of a

8

black man in this country.

10

This would be the first time if
we can just hold this to account.

11

But one thing I said last week,

12

which I wonder if you heard and talked about,

13

is that as we observed Laquan McDonald or the

14

Jason Van Dyke hearing, Pat Camden, media

15

spokesman on the witness stand, admitted that

16

he did that night what he always does, which is

17

go to the scene with other FOP officers and

18

agree on the lie that they are going to tell.

19

And that's the story that everybody has to

20

tell.

21

This case it was a little awkward

22

because the video came out, and Laquan McDonald

23

was not attacking him, he was walking away, and

24

he shot him in the back 16 times.

My work and my rep speaks for me.

2

Next week is spring break, because they don't

3

know nothing about cleanup week, and because

4

there isn't collaboration in the City between

5

yourselves, the Park District and the Chicago

6

Public Schools, so there's going to be a beast

unleashed on the streets with nothing to do, so

they are going to find something to get into.

they will, and there is blood that's flowing

through the streets of Chicago, and the City

known as Chiraq, Illinois, throughout the

nation, I think you all need to be charged.

I think it's clear that you need

to be charged with accessory to murder, because

it's clear that you are not doing anything

these countries, other than Guernsey and

5

But, anyway, the point is that

7

I'm convinced that it's my learned and other

people's understanding or similarly situated

9

that this is worse, the present arrangement

10

that we are in, the Hobson state of nature.

The Hobson state of nature, whatever
