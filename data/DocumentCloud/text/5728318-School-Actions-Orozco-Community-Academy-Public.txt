we're going to get the meeting started.

So let's get on --

Welcome to the meeting today.

This is a

11

So the overview of the legal process

for these meetings:
On October 1st, 2018, CPS published a draft of
the guidelines for the school actions;
Prior to December 1st, 2018, CPS proposed

18

school actions and sent notice letters and drafts of the

19

transition plans;

20

January 2019, CPS will hold two community

21

meetings.

22

be next week at Cooper;

23
24

So this is one of two.

Our next meeting will

And then February 2019 or later, CPS will make
recommendations to the Board after community meetings

TOOMEY REPORTING

 January 9, 2019
Page 6

and hearings.

2

school actions, and then the Board vote may occur at a

3

February board meeting or later.

The Board will vote on any recommended

4

MS. CARRETO:

(Speaking Spanish.)

5

MS. CARRETO:

And now the Chief of Schools is going

6

to make the presentation overview of proposed school

7

action.

8
9
10

MS. GARCIA-SANCHEZ:

Good evening.

So I'm going to

go through the overview of the proposed school action:
Adjust -- So we will be adjusting the Cooper

11

attendance area grades served to include sixth grade in

12

the 2019-2020 school year;

13

Then the following year we will adjust the

14

Cooper attendance area grades served to include seventh

15

grade in the 2020 and '21 school year;

16

In the following year, the third year, we will

17

adjust the Cooper attendance area grades served to

18

include the eighth grade in the 2021-22 school year;

19
20

Orozco will then expand its bilingual gifted
program to serve more bilingual students.

21

MS. GARCIA-SANCHEZ:

(Speaking Spanish.)

22

MS. GARCIA-SANCHEZ:

So we have engaged and given

23
24

feedback to date;
The school communities and elected officials

boundary change including elected officials;

well as The Resurrection Project, the Quality of Life

14

Plan - Education Component.

15

MS. GARCIA-SANCHEZ:

(Speaking Spanish.)

16

MS. GARCIA-SANCHEZ:

So Cooper is an attendance area

17

school located at 1624 West 19th Street, and it serves

18

kindergarten through fifth grade with a pre-K program.

19

Cooper currently serves 418 students.

MS. CARRETO:

12

MS. SANTIAGO:

13

Marissa Santiago.

14

also a member of the Local School Council here.

Good afternoon.

My name is

I am a parent at Orozco School and

15

I just wanted to make a comment and say that

16

this reassignment would benefit a lot of the children

17

that live in the southwest side of the city such as

18

myself, my -- well, my children.

19

We live in the McKinley Park-Brighton Park

20

area, and we commute every single day because we need

21

schools in the southwest side of the city such as Orozco

22

or something like this, gifted programs, not one that I

23

found that where I live, I would have to commute this

24

for the north or even further to -- for my children to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2019
Page 10

participate in a school like this.

2

So I think this would be a win-win situation
for all the children.

MS. PEREZ:

Good evening.

My name is Anabel Perez.

7

I'm a parent and a Local School Council member at

8

Cooper Academy.

9

I'm here to -- also, I believe, I'm in support

10

of having this gifted program compared to other

11

students, official students, and also having Cooper

12

going to K through eighth.

13

I have a daughter currently in fourth grade at

14

Cooper.

I had two other children who have attended

15

Cooper.

I was a student at Cooper many years ago.

16

And I believe in the dual language program, I

17

think that it's very important for our children, and I'm

18

very happy to have other parents here who I know that

19

also support this cause.

20

So we have --

MS. PEREZ:

That is all.

You have to sign up for that.

Oh, I do?
Okay.
Next we have Ana Padilla and

Jose Reguena.
MS. PADILLA:

Good evening.

I'm here as a

representative from Pilsen Neighbors Community Council.

14

We are here to show our support of the

15

expansion of the bilingual gifted program at Orozco but

16

also the expansion of the pre-K through eighth grade at

17

Cooper.

18

We support this because we started over two

19

years ago working with parents with a parent-to-parent

20

conference listening campaign.

21

Our organizer began working with parents to

22

develop leaders in the schools and, therefore, to

23

organize the betterment of the education of their

24

children.

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2019
Page 12

The result of this listening campaign in the

2

Pilsen Schools have resulted in the specialization of

3

two Pilsen Schools that has brought an IB program and

4

STEM program that has given quality education to the

5

Pilsen children.

6

Not only has these specialization initiatives

7

brought excellent academic programs, but we believe that

8

this will encourage hundreds of families to choose

9

Pilsen Schools as their academic choice to expand their

10

enrollment and to save our schools from future school

11

closures but also expanding the access to quality

12

education and programs like the gifted programs,

13

especially a bilingual program in our community.

Jose Reguena.

It's less

technical.
My name is Jose Reguena.

I'm here as a

representative of the Pilsen Alliance.
At the behest of some parents that had just
some concerns about the transition, it sounds like an

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 9, 2019
Page 13
1

amazing opportunity to bring much needed resources and

2

better programming to the students of the school and to

3

our community, which we absolutely, absolutely support.

4

The only concerns were, would this limit the

5

community programming, does this really mean that we're

6

going to take less students from a community school

7

programming, and do we do a disadvantage to future

8

students?

9

You know, I want all of the kids in this school

10

right now to have access to these programs for the

11

future, but some concerns of parents that are -- have

12

more kids, have kids that they're raising right now and

13

that they don't know if they'd be eligible for programs

14

like this at this school, and they very much want to

15

stay here.

16

It seems like a lot of work has gone into this.

17

I'm certainly not here to derail any work, only ask that

18

it gets shared with more of the community; that if

19

they're not in attendance of these schools right now but

20

would like to be, should be privy to these plans.

21

That's what I came here to share.

22

Thank you.

First of all, thank you so much for

being here this evening.

6

My name is Efrain Martinez, and I'm the

7

principal of Orozco School Academy, and I'm really happy

8

that this is happening.

9

And when I've come, I had a list of all the

10

people I wanted to say thank you to, but I think that

11

those people know who they are.

12

So most people I want to say is that I was home

13

at bed sick, that I received a text from the mothers of

14

Cooper and the mothers from Orozco, they were working

15

together, and they were showing their leadership schools

16

in the board meeting, and they were asking what they

17

wanted for their children, and just that that is

18

leadership, we need to celebrate.

19
20

So I'd like to honor these parents who are
leaders.

So thank you.

happening outside of the school conferring with the

parents and with Local School Council, and what I said

8

to them was that the parents were going to get together

9

and collect a signature what do you think about what's

10
11

happening outside of our school?
And what I had was a letter sharing what the

12

parents were doing, and in LSC, we would want to support

13

the change that was happening, and the parents and the

14

members that are part of the Local School Council, they

12

daughter here at Cooper or two in Cooper and one in

13

Orozco, and now I have one in fifth grade and one in

14

first grade, and I'm going to be fluctuating more like

15

bringing one here and bringing one in the other school.

16
17

And for them it's a change, right, that they
make that change because they have to do it, right?

18

And now, if they have the opportunity to say in

19

the same school, it's better, it's a better benefit for

20

those students.

21
22

This is what I wanted to share with you.
nice.

It's

Thank you so much.

I

just want to clarify so that what these parents have

2

said about Orozco.

3

To Marissa, I want to answer what I said a few

4

minutes ago is that I -- this is never on the agenda, it

5

was not in the agenda legally.

6

of the leaders of LSC, comment to the LSC that came and

7

gave us this information.

8

where it became to explain to us the changes.

There was no explanation

They haven't had a point

9

So with the signature that they were adhering

10

to was the expansion of the limits of Orozco that they

11

never actually explained that this was a closing of

12

program of neighborhood schools here.

13
14
15

Thank you for letting me explain all of this
because it seems like I'm lying.
I did support to expand that nobody explained

16

in any of the professions of the Local School Council

17

the project that we're talking about here.

18

If you today said that this is explained and

19

this was on the agenda of the Local School Council and

20

there was supporting this, did that really happen?

21

You're saying that this happened?

22

No, it didn't happen.

That's all that I'm

23

saying; that that didn't happen during a Local School

24

Council meeting.

We need a little bit of more attention from the

2

leaders of this project of explaining to us the Local

3

School Council right now of what's happening of this new

4

project.

5

And yes, I did sign, but I explained -- they

6

explained to me the expansion of this program, but it

7

didn't share to me that the program, the program was

8

going to be closed.

9

And like I asked the principal this morning,

10

never talked to me about it, so what I want to see is

11

how many signatures is signed and they asked for the

12

expansion of the program so in this program we've had at

13

this program and kindergarten.

14

Thank you.
