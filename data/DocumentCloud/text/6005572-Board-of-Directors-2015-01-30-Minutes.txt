Board and Committee Reports
Chairman Hammock provided an introduction to a new approach that will be taken with regard to
presentation of Committee information to the Board. The new fiscal year started on December 1st, and
this is the first Board Meeting that has access to the first month’s results of the new fiscal year. As an
independent Board, the Members are expected, appropriately so, to not only challenge the staff of the
System but to also support them, and also be transparent to the taxpayers of Cook County who help to
support this System.
As the Committee Reports are reviewed by each Chair, he has asked each
Committee to begin putting together a set of metrics that they will review in their individual Committee
meetings and discuss at length; they will then bring some summary group to the Board, so all can have an
appreciation of the issues around each Committee - where it is going, how it is performing, etc. The
metrics will be a regular monthly part of each Committee’s report. Additionally, he has asked each
Committee Chair to not only present the minutes of their meeting, but also to elaborate and highlight any
particular issues that arose at their meeting for the entire Board.
Chairman Hammock stated that, on a monthly basis, the designated Committee(s) will take some special
time (20-30 minutes) in each Board Meeting to highlight some big issues and give a more detailed report
about their activities; each Committee’s report will rotate once a quarter. Each month, the Board will get
metrics for each Committee; quarterly, each Committee will give their more detailed report. He noted that
the Directors should anticipate being in attendance for the meetings from 9:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M.
Chairman Hammock indicated that, when the Board looks forward to matters such as next year’s budget,
it should have a better handle on what has been happening this year as a result of its regular review of
Committee metrics and focus area presentations. Additionally, regarding the strategic plan, he stated that
the Board will soon need to update it; he expects that they will do that later this year, but having metrics
and being up to date on all the issues will inform the Board Members and help guide them as they do that.
In response to a question regarding the plan for the strategic planning activities, Chairman Hammock
stated that he and Dr. Shannon are working on how they will construct it and go about it with the Board’s
input. He noted that the strategic plan will not try to predict what health care will be ten years from now;
rather, the intent is to try to develop a strategic/operating plan that will guide the Board and administration
through the next three to four years to make the very best decisions on the key issues. They will return to
the Board with a plan; he expects that it will be done within the next six months, hopefully before the
budget.

Board and Committee Reports (continued)
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting of January 20,
2015. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Managed Care Committee Meeting, January 22, 2015
i. Metrics (Attachment #2)
ii. Meeting Minutes
Director Lerner presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the metrics with Doug Elwell, Deputy
CEO of Finance and Strategy. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the review of the information, Director Lerner inquired regarding the data under FYTD
Revenue and Expenses; he stated that it seems that the per-member per-month (PMPM) cost is below
the monthly composite PMPM, but it is showing a loss - why? Mr. Elwell responded that, at the
beginning of FY2014, in December of 2013 before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) kicked in, the
System was still putting up a 50% match; for the month of December, the System effectively got paid
half of the cost, and that was a $25 million loss. Now CountyCare is profitable for the System, but the
fact that the System had to put up half the match had an effect on the year to date totals. Director
Lerner suggested that a key or subnotes be included on the slides to explain issues such as that.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Marsh, moved the approval of the Minutes
of the Managed Care Committee Meeting of January 22, 2015. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

D. Human Resources Committee Meeting, January 23, 2015
i. Metrics
ii. Focus Area Presentation (Attachment #3)
iii. **Meeting Minutes
 Proposed Collective Bargaining Agreement/prevailing wages-related matter with Teamsters
Local 700
Director Wiese presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the metrics and Focus Area Presentation
with Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
In response to Director Velasquez’ question regarding a metric for language fluency, Dr. Shannon
stated that there is a commitment to address that subject. He indicated that it falls mostly under the
domain of patient satisfaction and patient safety; for that reason he suggested that the subject be
reviewed in the Quality and Patient Safety Committee.
In response to a question from Director Junge regarding whether there is a way to show the
relationship between the vacancies and the hires as a metric, Ms. Lopez stated one of the metrics that
she will start providing is the average time to fill, broken down by type of position.

Board and Committee Reports (continued)
Director Wiese noted that there is a need to develop metrics for the following two types of data that
overlap: 1) how many positions are crucial in any given year; and 2) how many positions does the
System have under contract. With regard to the question of the number of positions under contract,
she stated that the Board has never received a report that contains that information; she noted that
receiving that information is important and necessary.
During the discussion of the subject of the average time to fill positions, Director Estrada requested
information so the Board can have an understanding of how long it takes other safety-net, publiclyfunded hospitals to get employees on-boarded. Chairman Hammock stated that this would be a good
topic for the Human Resources Committee to address in their next Focus Area Presentation. He
would like to go into a little greater detail about some of the Collective Bargaining Agreements
(CBAs), to try to create that timeline about what is required under CBAs and the steps that System
staff take in relation to CBAs, so everyone has a clear understanding of it. Director Lerner stated that
it would be helpful, as part of the next focus, to receive an education on the CBAs; if there is some
difference between and among them, the Board ought to know what can be realistically achieved and
then decide how competitive the System is going to be, given labor shortages and certain constraints.
Ms. Lopez added that one of the subjects that has been discussed is that perhaps there is a need to
educate the public regarding the hiring process; if applicants know in advance how long it may take
and the steps that are required for the process, it could reduce or eliminate the frustration that
applicants experience when going through the hiring process.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Marsh, moved the approval of the Minutes
of the Human Resources Committee Meeting of January 23, 2015. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

E. Finance Committee Meeting, January 23, 2015
i. Metrics (Attachment #4)
ii. Meeting Minutes
 Contracts and Procurement Items (detail was provided as an attachment to the Board Agenda)
 Intergovernmental Agreement between Cook County, Illinois, through CCHHS, and the
Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, regarding payments for health care
services and administrative expenditures in support of the Illinois Medicaid program
 Proposed resolutions authorizing signatory updates for three (3) John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital
of Cook County bank accounts held at JP Morgan Chase Bank
Director Collens presented the Meeting Minutes and led a discussion regarding proposed metrics with
Mr. Elwell. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Collens stated that there is a need to find a way to develop process metrics on contracting and
measure those against good practices; due to the fact that the administration is currently working
towards filling the position of Executive Director of Supply Chain Management, the Committee is
probably several months away from developing a serious set of metrics on that subject. Mr. Elwell
concurred. He stated that the administration is going to try to expedite that; he noted that, at this
point, the System does not even have a contract management system, so that is also an issue, although
staff are now in the process of procuring one. In 90-120 days, he is hoping that the Committee will
have some metrics; those metrics will include measurement of the length of time from date of
requisition to time of contract and the percentage of contracts renewed on time.

IV.

Board and Committee Reports (continued)
Director Collens indicated that there also needs to be a metric for Request for Proposals (RFPs).
Additionally, he said that he is not sure whether there is a metric that would made sense for this, but
with regard to the System’s process of separating the contracts out some more in terms of what is a
pretty routine product purchasing that comes through the purchasing cooperatives, as opposed to
service contracts where there tends to be more questions, this perhaps is a subject that could be
measured in some way.
Director Lerner inquired whether staff can define and identify sole source versus multi source
contracts. He stated that it was also important to look at diversity within the contracting process to
make sure the minority groups have the opportunity to at least bid if not gain access to some of the
contracts. Chairman Hammock stated that, when the Committee or Board is analyzing a contract and
there is an increase involved, he would like for the members to be able to quickly understand whether
the increase is due to any of the following reasons: 1) because time is being added to the contract; 2)
because the volume has gone up significantly; or 3) because the price has increased (no change to
volume/time period).
Director Wiese indicated that a metric should be developed that relates to the measurement of the
accomplishments of the contract, or the evaluation of the key performance indicators (KPI) related to
the contract. Chairman Hammock stated that this would be a good topic for a Focus Area
Presentation. Mr. Elwell stated that there is a process that has been initiated relating to that; on a
quarterly basis, the vendor is brought in and KPIs are reviewed and rated by the manager of the
contract. This is a very new discipline; they are not doing it with many of the contracts yet, but staff
will work on a metric that can be reported back to the Board on that subject.
It was noted that Contract Compliance had not completed review of all of the contracts considered at
the January 23, 2015 Finance Committee Meeting; therefore, conditional approval was requested for
those requests that remained pending (request numbers 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 26, under
the Contracts and Procurements Items).
Director Collens, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting of January 23, 2015, with the
exception of request numbers 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 26, under the
Contracts and Procurement Items, which are conditionally approved, pending
being found responsive to the Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprise
provisions in the Cook County Ordinance on Procurement and Contracting,
which provisions are included in the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Procurement Policy. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Action Items (continued)
B. Proposed Amendments to the Rules of Organization and Procedure of the CCHHS Board of
Directors (Attachment #5)
Elizabeth Reidy, General Counsel, briefly reviewed the proposed Amendments. Director Butler
noted that, traditionally, under the Rules of the Board of Commissioners, when the County
Commissioners get into the roll call vote on a motion, a Commissioner is allowed a minute to explain
or enhance his or her vote; he inquired whether these Rules include that provision. Ms. Reidy
responded that it is not currently included, but it can certainly be added to track what they do at the
County Board.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of the
proposed Amendments to the Rules of Organization and Procedure of the
CCHHS Board of Directors, as amended.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Any items listed under Sections IV, V and VIII

VI.

Report from Chairman of the Board
Chairman Hammock stated that one of the goals for the Board Members is for them to try to review the
metrics in advance of the Board Meeting; when they receive their package of materials in advance of the
meeting, it will include the monthly minutes and the monthly metrics. He added that a revised schedule of
monthly Focus Area Presentations will be distributed.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #6)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #6. The Board
reviewed and discussed the information. Caryn Stancik, Executive Director of Communications provided
additional information regarding a recent event hosted by American Indian Health.
With regard to the event hosted by American Indian Health, Director Wiese noted that her organization,
the American Indian Association of Illinois, is one of the largest communities geographically for that
population; she has been working hard to get her community signed up for coverage under the ACA.
Dr. Wiese provided some background on the subject of health care needs and services for the American
Indian population. She stated that there is a lot of money allocated to reservation hospital systems, but
78% of American Indians live off of reservations, in cities like Chicago; while there is a clinic in Chicago,
there is one doctor for 100,000 people - that is indicative of the general status of American Indian health
care across the nation. She added that any discussions at the federal level regarding funding of health care
services should include the subject of increasing funding for urban American Indian health services.

Recognition

On December 11, 2014, four lives were saved as the result of the kindness of one family who suffered a tragic
loss. As their loved one was dying, they made the generous decision to donate the lungs, liver, kidneys and
pancreas for transplant as well as the heart for research. works very close with the Gift of Hope and has
recently instituted a new Family Support Protocol which has resulted in increased donations. The entire team -
from the doctors to the nurses to the social workers are involved in every organ donation case. The team on this
particular case included social worker Andy Wheeler and nurses Jeff Murphy and Mariflor Sumait whose
resuscitation efforts provided the critical time needed to harvest the organs. While Mariflor is a nurse,
she is also a Navy reserve nurse and an important leader in our Navy training program.

Provident Hospital of Cook County has received official notice from The Joint Commission of reaccreditation for
a three year period ending in November, 2017. The System/Provident team was headed by Dr. Krishna Das,
Peter Daniels, Dr. Aaron Hamb, Lisa Blutcher, Tom Whelan, Karen Duncan, Sandra Sperry .

Dr. Thomas Mason will be joining the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
(ONC) as the new Chief Medical Officer, effective February 23, 2015. In this federal position, Dr. Mason will lead
and champion clinical oversight of ONC programs and clinical coordination within ONC. ONC is organizationally
located within the Office of the Secretary for the US. Department of Health and Human Services and is the principal
federal entity charged with coordination of nationwide efforts to implement and use the most advanced health
information technology and the electronic exchange of health information. Tom is a board certified internist with
an emphasis on primary care and preventative medicine with 14 years of experience, who has practiced for
years in our Woodlawn clinic and has been an impassioned clinician and mentor in Project Brotherhood.
Throughout his career, he has led the implementation of multiple EHR systems, including the implementation of
EHR and our successful attestation of Meaningful Use Stages 1 and 2.

Activities

The Central Campus Redevelopment project continues to evolve. Key members of the leadership team have
been meeting regularly to outline an overall ambulatory strategy and plan for the services that will be located in
the new building. Meetings with key medical leadership to obtain their feedback around clinical areas have also
occurred. The initial responses to the Core Medical RFP are due on February This initial round will result in
the selection of a development team to work in partnership with and the Cook County Bureau of Asset
Management to program, design, develop and manage a series of distinct medical facilities on behalf of 
and the County. The new development will include outpatient clinical space and administrative office space.

Stroger Hospital is preparing for its triennial survey by The Joint Commission. Our ?window? for survey is open
and we expect a survey by November. Chapter groups to focus staff competencies and practice around specific
areas of requirements have been organized.

Page 52 of 54

 CCH HS is seeking Primary Care Medical Home (PCMH) certification from The Joint Commission. This is an
important step in the continued transformation of our delivery model to have patient treatment coordinated by
a team. This will ensure that our patients receive necessary care in the right place at the right time and in a
manner they understand. The initial certification will be sought at the Prieto Health Center with other health
centers to follow. The team at Prieto has been working for months to prepare for The Joint Commission?s
survey. The window for the survey opens in March.

This week, Crain?s Chicago Business published ?Running on Empty?, a report based on an analysis of Illinois
Department of Public Health annual survey data. Like other health systems across the country, the Cook County
Health Hospitals System is striving to provide the right care, at the right time, in the right place. This means
improving access to outpatient care and better managing the care of our patients across the continuum to
improve outcomes and lower costs. This transformation will naturally reduce hospitalizations thus impacting our
inpatient utilization numbers. This is one ofthe basic tenants of the Affordable Care Act. staffs to the
census at both Stroger and Provident and few hospitals staff to their licensed bed number.

There will always be a need for inpatient care and services to meet various needs, particularly for safety net
institutions. Stroger is one of four designated resource hospitals in Chicago that works with the Chicago Fire
Department to coordinate the healthcare response to disasters. Surge capacity is critical particularly in the case
of an urban hospital that operates one of the busiest emergency rooms and trauma units in the state.

Every year, hospitals are required to report utilization data to IDPH. Based on information from these reports,
the Crain?s report listed Stroger?s 2013 total occupancy rate as 67.3 percent and ICU occupancy rate as 27
percent. However, Stroger?s ICU occupancy rate was actually 52 percent in 2013. There appears to have been an
error in reported data that we are currently investigating. We intend to submit a revised report to the Illinois
Department of Public Health.
