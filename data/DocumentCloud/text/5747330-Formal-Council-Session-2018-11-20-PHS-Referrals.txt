Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 147 Intersection Consulting Group, request the vacation of the
north-south alley between Hendricks and the east-west alley west of Chene
and dedication of property for 23? wide alley for continuation of existing
east-west alley.

Petition No. 147 of Intersection Consulting Group on behalf of Ciena Healthcare and the
Eastwood Skilled Nursing Home Replacement project, request for the vacation of the
south V2 of the north-south public alley, 18 feet wide, in the block bounded by Hendricks
Avenue, 50 feet wide, Hunt Street, 50 feet wide, Dubois Avenue, 50 feet wide and Chene
Street, 60 feet wide; also for dedication of an alley outlet onto Chene Street in the same
block.

The request is being made to consolidate parcels of land and to accommodate a new
development consisting of a 100,000 square foot skilled nurse facility and associated
campus.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation
(utility review) and report. This is our report.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the vacation
provided certain provisions are met. The DWSD provisions are a part of the attached
resolution.

Planning and Development Department reports involvement and has provided a
recommendation of approval to Building and Safety Engineering and Environmental
Department with the condition that the consultant continue to confer with 
regarding color palette before the ?nal permits are pulled. (Special Land Use Hearing 
18-17)

Comcast reports involvement with for removal and relocation of their facilities. Comcast

RE Vacation of Alley between Hendricks and Alley West of Chene, and
Dedication of property for 23? wide Alley for continuation of existing Alley

On behalf of Ciena Healthcare and the Eastwood Skilled Nursing Home Replacement project, we
respectfully request approval for the vacation of the 18? public alley beginning at Hendricks St,West of
Chene, and tracking North to the existing East/ West alley North of Hendricks. In addition, Ciena would
like to dedicate land over the northerly 23 feet of Lot 12 of Block 23. This dedication and repurposing as a
public alley, will prevent the existing East/ West alley from incurring a ?dead end? and will allow users
continued access. These actions are requested in conjunction with establishment of a new 100,000 square
foot skilled nursing facility (under construction) and associated campus.

This $15 million project will be the ?rst new construction, skilled nursing facility built in the City of
Detroit in over forty years.
The site plans and ALTA surveys have been included with this petition request. Please feel free to contact

me with any questions.

Respectfully Submitted,

RE: DDOT Fare Increase Ordinance Follow-up

 

Thank you for your response to my request for additional DDOT funding to expand and enhance
services. Please provide the following additional information:



Cc:

The administration has indicated it will add funding for four Bus Ambassadors as a pilot
study in the upcoming ?scal year, including the bus shelter team. What is the expected
amount of funding that will be allocated for each program? How did the Department arrive
at four Bus Ambassadors? Given Detroit?s size and the number of routes I encourage the
administration to increase the number of Ambassadors to seven, which is equal to the
number of Districts.

Currently the proposed fare increase ordinance states that "[w]ith additional funding, the
Detroit Department of Transportation will evaluate this fare structure to consider the
inclusion of a reduced fare category for low income riders? (seepage 9 Section 4). It is my
understanding that the previous Equity Analysis took three months and cost $90,000. Please
provide a speci?c timeline for completion of the evaluation process, including the Equity
Analysis, and modify the ordinance language to state that this evaluation process will be
completed prior to the implementation of the fare increases.

I urge DDOT to create an ?affordable category with rates no higher than
the current rates in order to prevent an additional ?nancial burden on DDOT riders.

R-?rse iiol'ntutih'esitate to contact my of?ce if you have any questions. Thank you.

RE: Permits/Requirements on Temporary Slaging Sites for Major Construction Projects

 

Due to the 1-75 construction project and upcoming Gordie Howe International Bridge project, a
number of temporary construction staging areas are being located in the Delray area. Please respond
to the following:

What requirements does BSEED have in place to protect public health and safety around
these temporary sites, including dust/noise/trafflc mitigation? Are there buffering/setback
requirements or other additional measures where these sites are in close proximity to
residential areas?

How does BSEED work with the MDEQ to regulate these sites?

Has BSEED conducted a site visit at the West End site?

The fugitive dust ordinance does not apply to sites at which ?bulk solid materials are temporarily
situated for use in the construction at that site". Please provide more information regarding what is
considered ?temporary? under the ordinance, including the maximum amount of time a site can be in
operation and still fall within the temporary category.

Please provide a list of all current construction staging sites.
