The Interim Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The Cook County Assessor’s Office and Cook County Clerk’s Office request authorization
for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc.

This contract will satisfy the statutory requirements for the Cook County Assessor’s Office set forth in 35
ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 which require real estate assessments to be published at the same
time for the North and South suburban townships. Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. can publish the
North and South suburban townships under one umbrella.
This contract will also allow the Cook County Clerk’s Office to satisfy the statutory requirements set forth
in Article 12 of the Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/12-1 et. seq. which requires the Cook County Clerk’s Office
to place notices in a minimum of two newspapers for each suburban municipality in the election jurisdiction
on the same day and for the same duration of time. If multiple vendors are involved, there could be a
scenario where some newspapers in certain municipalities have different publication dates. This would
result in a loss of coordination of the notices and possible confusion among the voters. Therefore, it is
necessary to have one source that can publish notices in all election municipalities on the same day. Cook
County Suburban Publishers, Inc. can provide the necessary geographical coverage and guarantee that
notices are placed in the correct papers on the same day.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
