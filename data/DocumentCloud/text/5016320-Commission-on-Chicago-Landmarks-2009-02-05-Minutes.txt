 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
February 5, 2009
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on January 8th, at 1:30 p.m. The meeting was held at 33 N.
LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Landmarks Division, Department of Zoning and
Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cindy Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

81 E. Van Buren (Chicago Club)
(Historic Michigan Boulevard District – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new one-story rooftop addition, deck, and vegetative ‘green’ roof

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1.
The massing, siting and configuration of the one-story rooftop addition –
proposed to be setback 28’-5” from the exterior face of the parapet on
the east side of the building and 15’-7” from the exterior face of the
parapet on the north and south sides of the building, with a maximum
height of 9’-10” above the top of the historic parapet (excluding the
skylight) – is approved as submitted;
2.
Plans and details for any exterior lighting shall be submitted for
Landmarks review and approval prior to permit approval;
3.
Masonry cleaning specifications shall be submitted with the permit
application;
4.
The low-reflectivity glass (12% or lower) proposed for the rooftop
addition is approved as submitted;
5.
The proposed [glass] railing along the parapet at the perimeter of the
roof deck (proposed to extend 20” above the top of the parapet) shall be
restudied to set it back from the parapet and reduce its potential visibility
from the public way and Grant Park, such as by relocating and installing
it on the interior face of the planters or on the deck. Details shall be
submitted with the permit documents for Landmarks staff review and
approval. No additional railings visible from Michigan Avenue shall be
installed on the roof;
6.
The zinc cladding (VM Zinc rouge/red) and aluminum window frame
(dark bronze) materials are approved as proposed; and,
7.
The plantings within the proposed perimeter planters shall not be visible
from the public way.

 2.

3.

2141 W. LeMoyne
(Wicker Park District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed demolition of existing detached rear garage and construction of a onestory addition and attached three-car garage accessed from alley along side of
property

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1.
As proposed, the garage shall be attached to the main residence by a
“hyphen” connection between the existing building and the garage inset
a minimum of 1’-6” from the west (alley) property line;
2.
The proposed addition shall be clad in standard-size common brick to
match the secondary elevations of the main structure. Landmarks staff
shall review and approve masonry samples prior to order and
installation;
3.
The applicant shall provide garage door details, drawings or “cut-sheets”
with the permit application for Landmarks staff review and approval;
and,
4.
Any fence taller than 5’ or a solid wall shall be subject to Landmarks
staff review and approval.

Wacker Drive Esplanade, at Wabash Avenue
(Michigan Avenue Bridge and Wacker Drive Esplanade – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Temporary wood deck for seasonal sidewalk dining at upper end (sidewalk
level) of ramp from upper- to lower- level Wacker Drive

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1.
As proposed, the deck will be temporary and seasonal in nature,
constructed and dismantled on an annual basis for up to a five-year
period. The permit application shall state the erection and
dismantlement dates;
2.
As proposed, the deck shall be constructed of cedar. For Landmarks
staff further review and approval, the applicant shall provide additional
information on the possible pre- finish of the fascia of the deck to match
the limestone color. The color of the metal railing shall also be further
studied and reviewed and approved by Landmarks staff;
3.
Any attachments of the deck to the ramp shall be as minimal and
reversible as possible. No attachment shall be made to the balustrade or
esplanade limestone walls. The proposed six bracketed posts to be
bolted through the ramp slab shall utilize reusable sleeves or other
attachment to minimize damage to the ramp. The proposed permanent
changes to the ramp at the western edge (cutting into the slab to provide
a level surface area) shall be restudied in favor of alternatives that are
easily reversible. Any holes or other areas of attachment shall be
temporarily patched during the off season (including the removal of any
tripping hazards) and permanently removed and repaired after the final
season. Metal elements shall not stain the masonry. Attachments details
shall be submitted for Landmarks staff review and approval;
4.
Following removal, the ramp shall be cleaned at the conclusion of each
season, with cleaning specification subject to Landmarks staff review
and approval;

 5.

6.

7.

8.

4.

As proposed, except for the railing, and the moveable tables with
umbrellas and wait stations themselves, no posts or other elements are to
be higher than the railing itself;
Any additional lighting or signage shall be subject to Landmarks staff
review and approval. If electrical service is to be provided for the wait
stations, the conduit shall be concealed as possible and be minimal and
reversible in nature;
As currently proposed, the deck shall not be covered. Any future
proposals to add a trellis or other such element shall be subject to the
further review by the Permit Review Committee. Should such feature be
considered in the future, any trellis or other such element should be
limited to the area of the deck between the two obelisks of the balustrade
railing, and no closer than approximately 15 feet from each obelisk. The
architectural and civic character of the esplanade shall be considered in
designing a trellis or other such feature, taking into consideration such
issues as material, finish/color, scale and design vocabulary in particular;
and,
The project also remains subject to the requirements of the Department
of Transportation governing location, dimensions, materials, method of
attachment, etc.

29-39 S. LaSalle
(New York Life Building – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Continued Review: As part of a previously-approved Adopt-a-Landmark bonus
for a proposed adjacent office high-rise project at 29 S. LaSalle, continued
review of further revisions specific to the design treatment of the office tower
base and cantilevered overhang area above the landmark building

Action:

Approved (voted: 3 in favor, Phyllis Ellin against) with the following
conditions:
1.
The findings (i- iii) and conditions of approval (#1-6) from the
Committee’s review of the project on November 6th (decision letter
dated 11/10/08) are affirmed and remain in effect;
2.
The glass “shadow-box” proposed at the north end of the west
façade along LaSalle Street to hide the parking levels shall return
and continue for at least the first two bays of the north alley façade
where the parking levels are located;
3.
The following material samples are approved: the non-reflective
“Royal Gray” granite stone for the base; the Old Castle Clear Glass
with 50% light transmission and 8% reflectivity for the office
tower; and the “S.S. Champagne, Fluropon Classic II” nonreflective gray metal for the floor spandrels. The following
material samples shall be reviewed and approved by Landmarks
staff prior to order and installation: a mock- up with glass samples
for the shadow-box assembly at the parking levels; the final choice
of grey-speckle granite stone proposed for the base; and the dark
grey non-reflective (“Pewter”) metal panel proposed for the
overhang soffit and columns. Appropriate substitutes may be
approved by staff if they meet similar appearance, durability,
reflectivity, and quality of the samples reviewed and approved by
the Committee;

 4.

5.

6.

The architectural expression, selection of materials, and design
details, as proposed and approved, are important considerations in
the Commission’s determination that the project meets the
Commission’s design standards and guidelines. Any significant
changes may require further review and approval by PRC;
As part of the interpretive exhibit (see condition of approval # 5
from decision letter dated 11/10/08) on the New York Life
Building’s seminal steel- frame structure (exhibit to be located in a
public area of the historic building), information shall also be
included on the structural system and design of the new office
tower (both regarding how it works and why it was chosen); and,
Prior to the issuance of any permits, for the proposed demolition at
the rear of the New York Life Building, the owner shall provide
the Department of Zoning and Land Use Planning with fullyexecuted commitment letters (or other evidence reasonably
acceptable to Corporation Counsel) for financing of the 29-39 S.
LaSalle new construction project.
