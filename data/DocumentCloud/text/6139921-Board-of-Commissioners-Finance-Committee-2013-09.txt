The committee shall prepare an annual report. The report shall be
distributed to the individual members of the Board of Commissioners and the President's
Office before January 31 of each year. The report shall include minutes of meetings of the
Advisory Committee over the past year, including a list of attendees at each meeting, and

protect the dignity of the deceased that are brought into the Cook County Medical
Examiner’s Office.
Sec. 38-133. Death caused by wrongful act; liability for expenses incurred.
Any person, individual, partnership, corporation, firm, company, trust, estate,

(5)

from the Medical Examiner’s Office and then request to return them to the Office after
determining that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of the
burial shell and the burial cost.

 FINANCE AGENDA
SEPTEMBER 11, 2013
PAGE 71
(6)
Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made
later than one year of the person’s death (due to a return by Funeral Home). The Office of
the Medical Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for
amendments made to a death certificate after one year of the death.
(7)
Storage fee. This fee covers the bodies returned (by the Ffuneral Hhomes)
to the Office of the Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial
services and bodies brought to the Medical Examiner’s Office from hospice, nursing
homes, and hospitals for cases not falling under Medical Examiner jurisdiction as defined
in Sec, 38-118. This "storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns
a body and picks it up again within ten days. If the body is not picked up within ten days,
the body will be held and buried by the County according to the standard operating
procedures of the Medical Examiner. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the Office
of the Medical Examiner as a storage location by funeral homes and also encourages the
funeral directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from
the Office of the Medical Examiner. The ability to accept cases for storage will be at the
discretion of the Medical Examiner and will depend on the current and anticipated morgue
census. This “storage fee” discourages the use of the Office of the Medical Examiner as a
storage location for non-Medical Examiner cases or cases that have been discharged from
the Medical Examiner’s Office to funeral homes and encourages funeral directors to verify
that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the Office of the Medical
Examiner. In the cases of funeral homes, this “storage fee" would replace the "return fee"
if a funeral home returns a body and picks it up again within ten days. If the body is not
picked up within ten days, the body will be held and buried by the County according to the
standard operating procedures of the Medical Examiner.
(8)

Photographs, radiographs, and histology slides.

(9)

Charge to non-county owned hospitals for the acceptance of fetal remains
not falling under the jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner.

(10)

Confirmation of death letter.

(11)

Tissue procurement morgue use fee. Fee charged to a certified facility or
program seeking to procure tissue from bodies located at the Medical
Examiner's Office. The fee covers tissue procurement per body by a tissue
procurement facility or program authorized by the Medical Examiner.

(12)

Student rotation fee. Fee charged to institutions providing student
rotations at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset the County's costs for
disposable supplies as well as the staff time supervising the student
rotation.

(13)

Staff supervision of external experts. Fee charged to individuals
requesting to review slides, images and/or records at the Medical
Examiner's Office to offset staff costs for supervising such review.

(14)

Toxicology send out fees. Fee charged for processing, packaging and
shipping specimens to reference labs at the request of the decedent's next
of kin for testing.
