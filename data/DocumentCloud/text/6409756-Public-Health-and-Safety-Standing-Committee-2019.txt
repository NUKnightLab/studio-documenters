Submitting report relative to Police Surveillance and Facial Recognition Technology.
(Even identifying an accurate and clear understanding of how facial recognition
technology actually works is much more difficult than might be expected. The
technology has multiple formats and is used for many other things besides law
enforcement investigations. One scientific source generically describes the function as
follows: “Facial recognition is an advanced technology that helps in discerning and
identifying human faces from an image or video. A system employed to perform facial
recognition uses biometrics to map facial features from the photo or video. It
compares this information with a large database of recorded faces to find a correct
match.”) (REFERRED TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDING
