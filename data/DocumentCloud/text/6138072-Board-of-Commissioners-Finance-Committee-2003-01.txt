ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER 10:
THE CONTRACTING AND

10-18. The purchases of and contracts for supplies, materials, equipment,
and contractual services and all sales of personal property which has become
obsolete or unusable shall be based on competitive bids. If the amount
involved is estimated to exceed $10,000.00 25,000.00, sealed bids shall be
solicited by public notice inserted at least once in a newspaper of county-wide
circulation and at least five calendar days before the final date of submitting
bids. Such notices shall include a general description of the commodities or
contractual services to be purchased or personal property to be sold and shall
state where all blanks and specifications may be obtained and the time and
place for the opening of bids. The County Purchasing Agent may also solicit
sealed bids by sending requests by mail to prospective suppliers and by
posting notices on a public bulletin board in his office. Purchases, excluding
professional services, having a cost of $750.00 or less may be made with
"petty cash" in the open market. All purchases of $10,000.00 or less greater
than $750.00 and less than $25,000.00 may be made in the open market
without publication in a newspaper as above provided but whenever practical
shall be based on at least three competitive bids. No purchases, orders or
contracts of $10,000.00 25,000.00 or more shall be made unless authorized
by the Board of Commissioners. All sales of obsolete or unusable material
shall be made to the highest responsible bidder. Whenever the Board of
Standardization hereinafter provided for shall have prescribed standard
specifications, bids on purchases of supplies, materials, and equipment shall
be based on such standard specifications. All purchases, orders, or contracts
shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, taking into consideration
the qualities of the articles supplied, their conformity with the specifications,
their suitability to the requirements of the County and the delivery terms. In
the determination of the award to the lowest responsible bidder, nothing
herein shall be interpreted to preclude an award to a bidder other than the
lowest actual bidder if such an award is made in furtherance of affirmative
action policies adopted by the County Purchasing Agent for the promotion of
nondiscriminatory hiring practices and equal employment opportunity.
Provided , however, that the award of all contracts shall be responsible and
reasonable. Any bid may be rejected and new bids may be solicited if the
public interest is served thereby. Each bid , with the name of the bidder, shall
be entered on a record, which record with the successful bid indicated
thereon shall, after the award of the purchase or order or contract, be open to
public inspection. A copy of all contracts shall be filed with the County
Comptroller and with the County Purchasing Agent.

Section 2. This amendatory ordinance shall take effect and be in force
immediately after its passage.

* Referred to the Finance Committee December 17, 2002

* The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Tuesday, February 4, 2003.
