OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 18, 2002 from
JAM ES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
I am presenting to you for the consideration of the County Board of Commissioners, proposed language
amending the Cook County Classification Ordinance relating to C lass 9, Section 8 building units,
reduction of the assessment level for Class 3 properties, and expanding Class L (Landmark) designation.
The language relating to C lass 9, Section 8 wi ll he lp to prevent the displacement of critical Section 8 units
that, without this assistance, might otherwise be converted to condominiums. It applies to multi-family
buildings where at least 20% of the units are Section 8 and is applicable only to the units in those
buildings that are Section 8.
The s upply of Cook County multi-family rental housing has diminished by over 5,000 units in the last I 0
years and no market rate; non-subsidized affordable rental housing is currently being developed. In order
to maintain housing options for middle c lass fami lies and to attempt to reverse the 32% decline in Class 3
multi-family parcels, it is recommended that the assessment level for these properties be 30% in tax year
2003 and 26% in tax year 2004, these amounts reflecting the recalibration during the next assessment
cycle.
Lastly. because it is desirable to encourage not only the preservation and rehabilitation of individually
designated commercial and industrial historically and architecturally significant buildings, but a lso multifamily and not-for-profit bui ldings and the contributing buildings within landmark districts; the definition
of landmark properties has been expanded to include s uch parcels.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT CLASSIFICATION ORDINANCE
AS AMENDED
BE IT ENACTED BY THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMM ISSIONERS:
The Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance, as from time to time amended (November 29,
1976; June 6, 1977; September 19, 1977; May 16, 1978; January 2, 1979; March 3, 1980; September 2.

. 2002) is
hereby amended to read as fol lows:
The Cook County Board of Commissioners finds and declares:

1117

 JOURNA L OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2 1, 2002
(I)

that in certain areas of Cook County there is a lack of viable industrial and commercial bui ldings,
which is contributing to substantial unemployment in s uch areas;

(2)

that if existing industrial and commercial structures were improved and utilized full y, and if new
industrial and commercial structures were developed, the County's economic well-being would be
improved by an increase in the level of economic activity, by increased employment opportunities
and by a growth in the real property tax base;

(3)

that because of the blighted or depressed condition of the areas where such development is
needed, the ordinary unaided operation of private enterprise cannot accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation and development, therefore provision must be made for public
assistance and encouragement of such private enterprises;

(4)

that the creation of new property tax classifications for (a) new development of industrial
structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing industrial structures, for
the County as a whole as well as for specific areas of special need, and (b) new development of
commercial structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utili zation of existing commercial
structures in areas that are depressed, blighted or threatened with blight, is an appropriate and
necessary method of providing such assistance and encouragement, and will result in increasing
the tax base in s uch areas and for the entire County; and

(5)

that the creation of a new property tax classification for the rehabilitation and new construction of
certain multifamily rental housing will increase and improve the stock of decent, safe and
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households in Cook County, and will remove
the blight or potential bli ght of deteriorating housing stock while a lso increasing the tax base of
the County.

(6)

that the amendment of real estate assessment classifications for the purpose of lowering the
assessment level for certain retention and development of the most affordable permanent housing
avai lable to homeless and very low income individual s.

(7)

that the creation of a new property tax classification, to facilitate commercial and ind ustrial
development through remediation of property, contamination of which is not attributable to the
owner, is an appropriate and necessary method of providing assistance and encouragement to
achieve remediation and utilization of such property, which will result in increasing employment
opportunities as well as the tax base in the areas in which such sites are located and in the entire
County.

(8)

that the C lass L ereatioA of a Ae·n property tax classification, wil l ffi encourage the preservation
and rehabilitation of historically and architecturally significant eo1T11T1ereial aAd iAdt-:1strial
bui ldings, will enhance the general character of real estate in the County and contribute to the
economic well-being of the County by increasing the level of economic activity, increas ing
employment opportunities and contributing to the long-term growth of the real property tax base.

(9)

that the creation of a new property tax classification to encourage the preservation and retention
of existing affordable rental housing units is necessary and beneficia l to the population of Cook
County.

To qualify as a commercial development project under C lass 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the
proj ect be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
( I)

the area is, or has been within the last I 0 years, designated by federal, state or local
agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a
rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or proj ect adopted under the Illino is Urban Renewal

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2 1, 2002

Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Counci l on May 18, 1994, or the
Commerc ial District Development Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or
designation(s) of like effect adopted under any similar statute or ordinance; and
(2)

real estate taxes withi n said area, during the last six years, have declined, remained
stagnant or potential real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed
condition of the area; and

(3)

there is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation
of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably
timely basis if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the
economic enhancement of the area; and

(4)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will
materially assist development, re-development or rehabilitation of the area and the
commercial deve lopment project would not go fo rward without the full incentive offered
under C lass 7a or 7b; and

(5)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities w ithin the area.

Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b e ligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain
from the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County ifthe real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that factors ( 1)
through (5) are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports
and consents to the Class 7a or 7b app lication to the Assessor. A certified copy of s uch ordinance
or resolution sha ll be included with the C lass 7a or 7b app lication at the time of filing the
application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted,
will be fo rwarded by the Assessor' s Office to the secretary of the Board of Commissioners fo r
distribution to the Commissioners from the affected districts. The application shall include any
other info rmation deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
commercial development project qualifies fo r the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the
expense of doing so.
Inasm uch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of
Cook County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the
expense of s uch appl ications, the Assessor shall libera lly construe the requirements of factors ( 1)
through (5) for C lass 7a applications.
The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application
and supporting data.
Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient
size if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive
offered" as provided in factor (4) above, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to C lass 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of fu tu re profits w ith the
appropriate taxing districts.

1140

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2 1, 2002

For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that factors (I) through (5) exist, he shall,
within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data, certify the
commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Ordinance
In order to determine C lass 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee
of Cook County. The Committee shall within thirty days return the application to the Assessor
with a finding stating whether factors (1) through (5) are present. Upon receipt of a written
request from the Committee no later than seven days prior to the expiration of the thirty day
period, the Assessor may extend for a period not to exceed an additional thirty days the time for
return of the application with the Committee's finding. The Assessor shall review the app lication,
supporting data, findings of the Comm ittee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds
factors (I) through (5) exist, he shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings,
certify the commercial development project eligible for C lass 7b treatment under this Ordinance.
Class 7a and 7b ce1tifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new
construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of
the commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(B)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitali zation for purposes of Class 8
classification it is necessary: (I) that the municipali ty in which the area is located or, if an
unincorporated area, the County determine by lawful resolution that the area is in a state of
economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish
the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public
assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import; (2) that the municipality or,
if in an unincorporated area, the County app ly to the Assessor for certification of the area as one
in need of substantial_revitalization; (3) that, upon receiving an application to certify an area as in
need of_substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and
other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the severity of the economic conditions of
the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial revitalization_" requirement is met,
the Assessor s hall give strong consideration and substantial weight to the fact that an area is
located in a federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by
the Cook County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Counci l on May
18, 1994.
Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantia l
revitalization, as defined in this Ordinance, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area.
In making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the
specific area for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the
C ity of Chicago shall be the "community area" as defined herein; for all other areas in the County
it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.
If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18,
1994, determines by municipal resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and
that it is not economical ly feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public ass istance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for C lass 8
certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this ordinance. However, each
property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file their application in a
timely manner.

OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication from
DOROTHY BROWN, Clerk of the C ircuit Court
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $59,400.00 and extend for five (5)
months, Contract No. 02-41-226 with Chicago Systems Group, Inc. (CSG), Chicago, Illinois, to continue
to develop enhancements to the Traffic Rewrite Information Management System (TRJMS), the recently
implemented program in the Traffic Di vision of the Circuit Court.
Board approved amount 09-20-0 I :
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$ 2 19,600.00
59.400.00
$ 279,000.00

Essentially, the need for the extension is that we underestimated the complexity of the
changes required. Requirements were understood at a high level , but once the project team
worked through the details, we could see that the modifications would be more extensive. In
fact some of the functionality that we thought could occur at the registers must be performed
within the TRIMS due to the nature of the registers software, thus adding to the amount of
changes to TRIMS and we had to additionally develop batch backup processing to be used
s hould the real time updates from the registers not go throug h. This extension should be all
that is required to complete this project.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $59,400.00. Contract extension : February I, 2002 through June 30, 2002 .
(360-260 Account).

Commissioner Carr, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be
authorized to increase and extend the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

OFFICE OF THE CHIEF JUDGE
GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 27, 2002 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, C ircuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to accept a grant in the amount of $300,000.00 from the Illinois Criminal Justice
Information Authority (ICJIA). This grant will fund services to delinquent minors identified by the court
to be in need of c linical intervention. Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST) clinicians will provide intensive
therapeutic services for minors between the ages 12 and 17 who have been diagnosed with mental health
disorders. The services provided by thi s program will help to reduce the number of minors placed in
expensive residential treatment fac ilities by allowing minors to remain in the community without
compromis ing public safety.
The MST model was developed approximately fifteen years ago by at the Medical Uni versity of South
Carolina. Through the combined use of well-known therapeutic techniques such as cognitive behavior
therapy, MST addresses complex issues faced by multi-need families. Also, MST clinical interventions
target the family as the client rather than the individual minor. Strong evaluation, quality assurance
measures through strict adherence to well-defined protocols, and foll ow-up are essential components of
MST. Grant funds will be used to pay for therapeutic services, as well as travel by staff, computers and
telecommuni cations equipment and office supplies.
The grant requires cash matching funds from Cook County of$ I 00,000.00.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $I 00,000.00. Grant Award: $300,000.00. Funding period: March I, 2002

CLERK OF T HE CIRCUIT COURT, Dorothy Brown, transmitting a Communication,
dated December 4, 200 I:
Please find the submitted Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000 Independent Audit Reports and
their related Memorandum on Internal Controls for the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit
Court. Please accept these reports and refer them to the Cook County Audit Committee
for the appropriate review.

*Referred to the Audit Committee on December 18, 2001
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page one regarding the status of the conversion of
records to an integrated cashiering system, Ronald Banks stated the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit
Court was completing its review and validation of information contained in an integrated study done by
UNISYS and was finalizing the specifications on a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a new Integrated
Cashiering System.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's inquiry on the ap proximate cost of an integrated cashiering
system, Mr. Banks stated he estimated a cost of over $3 million.
Commissioner Hansen requested a target date for completion of a RFP and its submittal to the Board. Mr.
Banks stated he anticipated the RFP wo uld be forwarded to the Purchasing Agent and submitted to the
Board by April I, 2002.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page two regardi ng if full recovery of overpayments
to municipalities on traffic disbursements versus receipts during the 200 I fiscal year has been completed,
Mr. Banks stated that the Office has recovered and reduced the receivables cited in the report with the
exception of three municipalities.
In response to Comm issioner Hansen's question on page two regarding the status of escheatment of Ch ild
Support checks outstanding from 198 1 to June 1994, Mr. Banks stated this item was completed on
November I, 200 1 w ith the escheatment of$372,924.49 in outstanding Child Support checks to the State
of Illinois Department of Financial Institutions in accordance with the Illinois Unclaimed Property
Statute.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page four regarding if the Office had requested a legal
opinion from the State's Attorney's Office related to wri ting off NSF checks deemed uncollectable, Mr.
Banks stated the Office of the Clerk of the Circ ui t sent correspondence dated November 15, 200 I
requesting a legal opinion but had not yet received a response from the State's Attorney.

1276

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 21, 2002

Chairman Daley called on Patrick Driscoll to respond to the status of a legal opinion from the State's
Attorney's Office to the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court on this issue.
Mr. Driscoll stated that approximately three months ago the State's Attorney received several requests for
legal opinions from the Circuit Clerk on the issues found on pages 4, 5 and 6 of this Internal Control
Memorandum Audit Report. He noted the State's Attorney had just received a copy of the report
yesterday and should have a response to the Clerk on each request in seven to ten days.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page seven regarding if the Office had automated
reconciling the Cash Bond Account, Mr. Banks stated this was completed November 30, 200 I with all
supporting documentation retained and a uniform procedure for the release of bonds when probation is a
factor is in place.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page eight regarding the status of the Office's review
of its escheatment procedure or policy relating to compliance with statutory requirements, Mr. Banks
stated the review has been completed, escheatment of outstanding Child Support checks and Bail Bonds
was done in 2001 and to date the Office is in compliance with the requirements of the Illinois Unclaimed
Property State and Abandoned Bond Statute.
Commissioner Butler commented on the length of time to cash a check and the recent change from 90
days to 30 days. He requested information from the State's Attorney on whether the County would still be
liable for funds on checks outstanding after 31 days.
Patrick Driscoll responded that a claim could be made to the County requesting that a new check be
issued. He noted that 30 days is considered a relative short turn-a-round timeframe, which may create
more paperwork and cost for the County.
In response to Commissioner Goslin's question on page two regarding what is being done to achieve full
recovery of overpayments to municipalities, Ron Banks stated all payments have been received with the
exception of the Village of Deerfield, the Village of Burr Ridge and South Suburban College. He
explained the Office is working with these 3 agencies to recoup the payment, but since each does not
receive a significant amount of traffic revenue it is taking longer for them to repay.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 21 , 2002

In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 25 regarding the proper maintenance of records
for funds received from Federal grants, Vince Garrett stated to date the Sheriffs Office had implemented
the Auditor's recommendation found on page 26 of the report.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the use of Narcotics and Asset Forfeiture Fund
on real estate or real estate improvements, Jack Kelly stated funds were used on two storage facilities (one
on county property and one on forest preserve property).
Commissioner Hansen asked if Board approval was received for these improvements. Mr. Kelly stated he
would research whether approval was received and provide a written res ponse to the Chairman.
In response to Commissioner Goslin's question regarding the status of the Auditor's recommendation
relating to inventory and reconciliation of the Narcotics and Asset Forfeiture Fund, Jack Kelly stated a
new general ledger accounting system was installed in December 200 I and all financial transactions for
fiscal year 2002 will be recorded in the new accounting system.
Commissioner Lechowicz commented on the importance of knowing for next year's budget preparation if
any state or federal grant funds will be diminished. He requested an opinion from the County Auditor on
any estimated shortfalls of grant funds, including a recommendation for the Board on what to do in
preparation for such shortfalls and the impact on grant funded programs.
Laura Burman reminded the members that the Board approved an amendment during the 2002 Budget
process calling for any county agency or office seeking new grants to first submit information to the
Board for approval before obtaining new grant dollars.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page I 0 regarding negative balances in grant funds,
John Chambers stated that grant programs are continued or renewed prior to the grant funds being
received due to the differences in the county, state, and federal governments fiscal years. He stated this is
only done to allow for the uninterrupted continuance of grant programs where funds are known to be
forthcoming.
Commissioner Hansen recommended in future reports that the Auditors include a simple asterisk and
footnote with an explanation on negative balances.
On the issue raised regarding future shortfalls in state and federal grant funds for county programs,
Chairman Daley agreed with Commissioner Lechowicz's concern and noted the President has directed the
County's Budget Director to make sure all agencies are aware of the new budget amendment relating to
grants and to report to the Administration and Finance Committee on any foreseen shortfalls in grant
funds including any recommended actions to consider in preparation for next year's budget.

MEMORANDUM ON INTERNAL CONTROL. Transmitting a Communication, dated
February 18, 2002 from Thomas J . Glaser, C hief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance.
Submitting the Memorandum on Internal Control for Cook County, Illinois relating to the
audit for the fi scal year ended November 30, 2000. The accompanying Comprehens ive
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2000 was
previously distributed to the Board. I respectfully request that this report be referred to
the Audit Committee for further discussion.

*Referred to the Audit Committee on February 21, 2002
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page two regarding how much of the amounts
classifi ed as unidentified have been distributed, Kim Feeney stated the Treasurer's Office is in the middle
of its 2000 and 200 I audits and o nce those audits are completed the Office will most likely fini sh
distributing the remaining money according to the direction of the State's Attorney. She stated the Office
distributed $22.9 million of the original $26 .5 million on July 31 , 2001 to various taxing bodies; however
she noted approximately $3.7 million is being held back and earmarked to address issues found prior to
1998.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding what is being done to address the iss ue of
GASB reporting requirements having a negative impact o n the County's system of internal control and its
ability to prepare time ly and accurate GAAP financial statements, John C hambers stated he disagreed
with the statement that the requi rements may threaten the systems and accuracy of county financial
reports. However, he noted the new standards might require the creation of a Financial Reporting
position in the 2003 Budget to ensure compliance w ith the new GASB reporting requirements.

1279

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 21, 2002

Chairman Daley requested a written response from the Chief Financial Officer and Auditor addressing the
new GASB reporting requirements impact on the County's system of internal control and budget.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page four regarding the status of the department being
in compliance with the Cook County' s Taxpayers' Interest Assurance Ordinance, Dr. Parmer stated the
department would be in total compliance in a week or two. He explained the department has initiated
with the Bureau of Finance and the depository bank the paperwork necessary to implement the
recommendation and has also begun sending checks to the Comptroller on a regular schedule.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page nine regarding an explanation of the problem,
John Chambers stated the alleged problem dealt with how the County paid contractual employees such as
court reporters and interpreters. He explained the Bureau of Finance consulted with Deloitte to review
what could be deemed regular employees rather than contracted employees and they provided an opinion
and recommendation on how to proceed. He stated the issue has been remedied by placing these
individuals on the payroll as 130 employees rather than 110 regular employees.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page I 0 regarding the recommendation for making
the implementation of an off-site security system, disaster recovery and business continuity plan a
priority, Cathy Maras-O'Leary stated the issue is being reviewed and has been found to be very
complicated to gather the detailed specifications due to the lack of resources she currently has in her
office. She said she has budgeted monies for an outside consultant that could be dedicated to researching
and coordinating the various county agencies mission-critical system needs, the data exchange needs of
outside users and the overall RFP specification and capital planning for this initiative. She noted that the
county has already invested in uninterruptible power supplies, redundant hardware, and generators for its
main processing center. She also noted that the point-to-point circuits for the wide area network ( WAN)
will be replaced by a fiber ring for added disaster recovery.
In response to Commissioner Hansen 's question regarding what the estimated initial capital outlay would
be and whether other major counties of comparable size had completed an off-site operations center in
case of a disaster, Ms. Maras-O'Leary stated the initial capital outlay is estimated to be between $12 to
$ 18 million . In terms of a survey of where other major counties are on this issue, she stated she would
begin to inquire and get back to the Committee.
Jn response to Commissioner Hansen 's questions on page 13 regarding if the Sheriffs Office had
implemented a new genera l ledger system and com plied with the Auditor's recommendation re lating to
the escrow account of forfe ited funds, Jack Kelly confirmed that the Office had completed both issues.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's questions on page 18 regarding if the Veterans' Assistance
Commission had implemented the Auditor's recommendations relating to monthly reconciliation and the
clarification of authority limits and segregation of duties, Alvin Starks confirmed that the Commi ssion
had completed both recommendations.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 19 regarding if the Liquor Control Commission
had implemented the Taxpayers' Interest Assurance Ordinance requirements, Laura Burman stated the
Commission does hold balances that exceed the $ 100,000 FDIC insurance limit for a short period of time
when license fees are being collected ( in April and May). She confirmed that the Deputy Liquor
Commissioner, Jack Weinrauch, was in the process of working on the collateralization factor with the
depository bank.

1280

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 21 , 2002
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the status of the Recorder of Deeds Office's
RFP for a new cashiering system, Ray Wolverton stated the RFP for a new cashiering system was
released on November 17, 200 I. He said responses were received in early January, evaluation of the
seven responses received has been done, the scope was narrowed down to a short list of three companies
in early February, and demonstrations of the three companies' products were provided in the Office. He
stated the Office is prepared to submit to the Board a request for approval on entering into contract
negotiations with the selected company, which should appear on the agenda at the March 7, 2002
meeting.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on when the current UNISYS system was installed and
the estimated cost of a new cashiering system, Ray Wolverton stated the UNISYS system was installed in
October 1997 with acceptance of the product by the Office given in early 1998. Shortly thereafter
implementation problems were found; the company that installed the product was call ed back in for
assessment and their findings called for replacement of the system. He estimated the new system would
cost no more than $3 million.
Commissioner Hansen commented on how upsetting it was to see money spent on a system that within
three years needs replacement. He recommended in the future, RFP specification and review of the scope
of services should be evaluated by not only the office purchasing the hardware or software system but
also coordinated with the Chief Information Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
On thi s issue, Cathy Maras-O' Leary stated that she was not involved in the UNISYS system RFP and
implementation but at the request of the Audit Committee, participated first-hand in looking at the scope
of the proj ect and personally assisted on drafting the RFP for a new cashiering system with the Recorder's
Office.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's request for her opinion on whether an RFP is better than a bid,
Ms. Maras-O' Leary stated yes. She commented on the difficulties of clearly defining the hardware or
software specifications in a bid packet, as well as the limitations placed on the county in making any
changes to the scope to take advantage of new technology through the bid process. In her opinion, RFPs
give the county more options at no cost by allowing input from the vendors through their proposals to
fi nd improved or more innovative technological means to address the systems current scope, as well as
upon review of the proposals, the flexibility to make changes for future needs that originally the county
may not have specified or considered.
As a follow-up, Chairman Daley asked if the county received what was promised in terms of the previous
RFP and contract for services with the UN ISYS cashiering system or is there a liability issue that needs to
be addressed. He also inquired on the cost of the UN ISYS system. Mr. Wolverton noted the total cost of
the past system was $3.2 million and replacement cost is estimated at less than $3 million. He stated in
terms of liability, the Recorder's Office did bring a warranty issue and question of vendor liability up with
the State's Attorney's Office, but was told it would not be cost effective to pursue the issue.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page 2 1 regarding if the State's Attorney's Office had
implemented the Auditor's recommendation to collateralize three accounts to be in compliance with the
Cook County Taxpayers' Interest Assurance Ordinance, Ray Balcarcel stated the Office is in compliance
with the Ordinance. He noted the recommendation involved three accounts at Bank One, which the
Auditor said totaled more than the $ 100,000 FDIC insured limit. Since the Audit Report was issued, the
Office confirmed with the bank that these accounts were already included on a larger list of collateralized
deposits.

1281

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2 1, 2002

In response to Comm issioner Hansen's question on page 22 regarding a target date for a county-wide
investment policy, John Chambers stated he was not responding for the Treasurer' s Office on this
particular issue but was aware it is the intention to bring before the Board an amendment to the
Taxpayers' Interest Assurance Ordinance to reduce the 11 0% collateralization to I 02%. Responding on a
target date for a county-wide investment policy, Dan Degnan stated the Treasurer's Office did implement
a formal investment policy on December I, 1999 in compliance with state statutes. He noted in terms of a
county-wide investment policy, the Treasurer did submit the Office' s formal investment policy to the
County ' s Chief Financial Officer and would be happy to discuss it further if the County wishes to adopt
this policy county-wide.
Commissioner Hansen requested information from the County Auditor, Chief Financial Officer and
Treasurer's Office covering the recommendation found on page 22 regard ing a county-wide investment
policy, which the committee could discuss at its next meeting.
Laura Burman stated the Treasurer implemented an internal office Investment Policy that is in compliance
with the County's Taxpayers' Interest Assurance Ordinance. However, a county-wide investment policy
has not been developed or coordinated with the Treasurer's Office, which the audit recommendation
states should be considered.
Chairman Daley asked Tom Glaser to meet with the Treasurer's Office and follow-up on this request with
a written response to the C hairman for further discussion. He asked that the response include the
recommended actions and need for implementing a county-wide investment policy.
Commissioner Lechowicz commented on the current 110% col lateralization policy on county-wide
investments of public funds under the Cook County Taxpayers' Interest Assurance Ordinance. He
mentioned the Comptroller's previously stated comments on the Administration 's intentions to amend the
Ordinance to lower the requirement to I 02%. He stated he understands some banks or agencies may
believe the current collateralization is too restrictive, however he stressed the policy was put in place to
not only assure the safety of the county's investments, but most importantly for the taxpayers benefit to
assure them that all public funds held by the county get the highest return of interest. He noted the State
of Illinois also collateralizes their funds at 110% and feels it is important that the County's Ordinance is
enforced with no exemptions except with Board approval. He referenced the current audit report and the
agencies that were shown to be in noncompliance with the Ordinance and asked what was being done to
bring a ll county agencies into compliance.
Chairman Daley recommended a letter be sent to a ll county agencies reiterating the 110%
collateralization policy on fund s along with a copy of the Cook County Taxpayers' Interest Assurance
Ordinance.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Com missioner Goslin, moved to receive and file Communication
No. 249895. The motion carried.

Sheriff s Court Services Department - Civil Process Divi sion and Administrative & Support Services
Department - Fees and Trust Funds for year ended November 30, 1999.

Submitted to the Audit Committee on January 28, 2002
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question on page five regarding what were the economic
reasons for not using interest-bearing accounts, Jack Kelly stated the funds were insufficient in these
accounts to cover the monthly service fees of $30 per month charged by Amalgamated Bank.

1282

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MA RCH 2 1, 2002

Commissioner Lechowicz commented that if the monthly service fees exceed the interest generated, the
agencies s hould seek Board review and approval for an exemption from the Taxpayers' Interest
Assurance Ordinance.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question on page six regard ing the reason for the significant
increase in the communi ty service fee, Mr. Kelly stated the increase was due to a large increase in the
number of participants in the SWAP community program.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question on a reason for the significant levy increase, Mr.
Kelly stated he did not know the reason but would look into it and get back to the Committee with an
answer.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question on whether a general ledger system had been
implemented, Mr. Kelly responded it was installed in December 200 I.
Commissioner Lechowicz commented that he noticed several times in the audit a reference to a Peachtree
Software system and asked for some information on thi s system. Mr. Kelly stated it refers to the software
used in the Sheriffs general ledger accounting system.
In response to C hairman Daley 's question on page nine regardi ng ifthe December I, 2001 target date was
met, Mr. Ke lly stated it was.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file Item 5. The
motion carried.

Department of Building and Zoning - Fee Report for year e nded November 30, 2000.

Submitted to the Audit Committee on January 28, 2002
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page eight regarding if there had been any discussion
to resolve the problem of sending the public to various offices in different buildings simply to pay for
permits or licenses. Commissioner Hansen noted the audit recommendation mentioned the possibility of
setting up a satellite office fo r the Department of Revenue at the Cook County Admini strat ion Bui lding.
Barb Bruno noted there wasn' t a problem when the Departme nt of Bui lding and Zoning was located in
the same building and stated that most of the fees are paid by mail.
Don Wlodarski stated he did not have any numbers to reflect if thi s was a big problem, but noted his
department has been meeting wi th the Bureau of Administration and the Industri al Engineers, and would
reach out to M IS and the Department of Revenue to see if some online payment system might be feasible
to solve this inconvenience to the public.
Chairman Daley commented that thi s problem of shuffling the public back and fo rth between county
offices is not just confined to the De partment of Building and Zoning. He mentioned his office
encounters individuals frustrated by being sent to and from the vari ous county agencies that service
property records, assessments and tax payments.
Commissioner Lechow icz agreed w ith the Chairman and suggested the county look into what he termed a
"one-stop-shopping" system using electronic links on the county WAN between the various offices to
provide access to payment options.

Submitted to the Audit Committee on January 28, 2002
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question on page two regarding what action the department has
taken on amounts owed or overdue as of November 30, 2000, Dr. William Franek stated the majority of
the fees billed ($204,46 1.22) for operating permits were received shortly after November 30 by the
County. However, for the remaining ($42,866.22) outstanding money owed from prior monthly billings
the department has sent second and final notices out to the businesses. He explained if payment is not
received after four months of nonpayment from the original bill, a court citation is issued pursuant to the
Cook County Environmental Control Ordinance, Article 5.4-1, "Certificate of Operation Required" and
the businesses must appear in court ready to make payment ifajudgment is entered.
Commissioner Hansen asked the percentage resolved once a citation is issued. Dr. Franek responded
80% to 90% of nonpayments are resolved after a court citation is issued.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved to receive and file Item No. 7. The
