PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
PROPERTY TAX INCENTIVE - PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENT
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 74 TAXATION, Section
74-71 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-71. - Laws regulating the payment of wages.
(a) Living wage requirement.
(1) Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that receives
a property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9
multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living Wage, as defined in the Cook
County Procurement Code (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. IV, Div. 1 § 34-121), to each of
its onsite Employees, unless such Employees' Wages are governed by Federal or State prevailing
wage law. For purpose of this Section, the term "Employee" shall mean an Employee who
performs duties or services for an Employer on average at least 30 hours per week in any twoweek period for which the Employee is paid; "hours per week" shall mean hours for which an
Employee is paid or entitled to payment by the Employer for a period of time during which no
duties are performed by the Employee due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity, jury duty,
military duty or approved leave of absence.
(2) On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive shall
notify all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this Section.
Upon commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a property that receives a property
tax incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the municipality or the Cook County
Board, as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such lessee is paying a Living Wage to its
Employees in compliance with this Section. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
requirements of this Section shall not apply to an Employer who was a lessee and not an owneroccupant of a property that receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.
(3) This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-profit organizations or funded by Federal
grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a property that receives
a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance. Further, this Section shall
not apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County Board that compliance with the
requirements of this Section would cause such Employer to be in violation of the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and a labor union.

(4) Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living Wage
requirements and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the Living Wage.
In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee contends that the
Employer is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this section, that Employee may
file a complaint with the Cook County Commissioner on Human Rights ("Commission"). The
Commissioner shall investigate alleged violations of the Living Wage Ordinance and is authorized
to adopt regulations for the proper administration and enforcement of its provisions. If at the
conclusion of the Commission's investigation, the Commission finds that the Employer has
violated this section, it shall (i) in the case of an Employer receiving a property tax incentive,
notify the Assessor; or (ii) in the case of a Contractor or a subcontractor required to pay the Living
Wage, notify the CPO, who shall exercise such remedies as are in the best interest of the County,
including ordering the Employer to pay back pay and penalties, as provided in this section.
(5) If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required to pay
back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be fined by the County up to $100.00 for each
affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such penalties will not be
imposed on any Person except after a hearing (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 2, Art. IX). Further,
if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, the property tax incentive for this property
is subject to revocation.
(6) If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer's property
tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer appropriately reinstates or compensates
such Employee.
(7) For the purposes of this Section:
Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2 of this
Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily residential
property. "Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted to supportive living
facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing home care for low income older persons and persons
with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certified by the State Department of Public Aid pursuant to
Division 2 of this Article; and
Sales tax means the Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax.
(8) Living Wage Affidavit. Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a Resolution
or Ordinance or authorized officer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant for a Class 6b
industrial property or a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive shall maintain in its files and
records documentation that such municipality or the County Board received and filed the Living
Wage Affidavit submitted by the owner or lessee of such property stating that such owner or lessee
is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in compliance with this Section. Further, an applicant
or lessee of a Class 9 multifamily residential property tax incentive shall provide the municipality
or the Cook County Board, as the case may be, a Living Wage Affidavit which shall be maintained
by such municipality or the Cook County Board in its files and records.

incentive classification, then, after notice from the Assessor of such violation, the Person or
Substantial Owner shall have 45 days to cure its violation and request an exception or waiver from
the Assessor. Failure to cure or obtain an exception or waiver of ineligibility from the Assessor
shall serve as grounds for revocation of the classification as provided by the Assessor or by the
County Board by Resolution or Ordinance. In case of revocation or cancellation, the Incentive
Classification shall be deemed null and void for the tax year in which the incentive was revoked
or cancelled as to the subject property. In such an instance, the taxpayer shall be liable for and
shall reimburse to the County Collector an amount equal to the difference in the amount of taxes
that would have been collected had the subject property not received the property tax incentive.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

INSPECTOR GENERAL
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 2 Administration, Article
IV Officers and Employees, Division 5 Inspector General, Section 2-285 and Section 2-287 of the Cook
County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 2-285. Cooperation.
(a) It shall be the duty of all County employees, officials, agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees,
grantees or persons or businesses seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of eligibility
for County contracts, to cooperate with the OIIG in the conduct of investigations undertaken pursuant to
this division. Every County contract and every bid, proposal, application or solicitation for a County
contract and every application for certification of eligibility for a County contract or program shall contain
a statement that the person, individually and on behalf of the applicant, will abide by all provisions of this
division. It shall be unlawful for any person subject to this Section to refuse to cooperate with the
Independent Inspector General as required by this Section. The penalty for such violation shall be governed
by Section 2-291.
(b) All persons with whom the OIIG requests an interview are required to comply in a timely fashion.
Within constitutional limitations, failure by any County employee, official, agent, contractor, subcontractor,
licensee, grantee or person or business seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of
eligibility for County contracts, to cooperate with any reasonable request by the OIIG carries the threat of
sanctions and/or criminal contempt proceedings, and any other penalties the County Board has within its
scope to assess.
(c) Nothing in this compliance section may be interpreted to allow the OIIG to violate any individual's
constitutional rights, including the 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.

(d) It is the duty of every employee, department and elected official to cooperate with the Independent
Inspector General in any investigation or hearing. Each department's premises, equipment, personnel,
books, records and papers shall be made readily available to the Independent Inspector General.
(e) If the Independent Inspector General issues a recommendation of corrective action to the head of a
County department or bureau, that department or bureau head must respond to that recommendation within
30 45 days with a written response to the Independent Inspector General and Chief of the Bureau of Human
Resources. This response must include either (1) a description of any corrective action the department or
bureau head has taken or (2) a request for a 30-day extension of the 30 45 day decision period if additional
time is needed by the department or bureau head to review the recommendation of corrective action. If the
head of that department or bureau did not take any corrective action, or took a different corrective action
than that recommended by the Independent Inspector General, the department or bureau head must describe
the different action and explain the reasons for the different action in the written response. This response
must be submitted to the Independent Inspector General and Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources
within the 30-day decision period. The Independent Inspector General may approve a request for an
extension of this 30 45-day decision period for a period of time not to exceed 30 days if additional time is
needed by the head of the department or bureau to review the recommendation of corrective action. If a
department head, bureau chief, or separately elected official fails to meet the 45-day requirement or, if
approved, the 30-day extension the Independent Inspector General shall notify the Chair of the Litigation
Sub-Committee and the President when there is a failure to reply. The chair of the Litigation SubCommittee may then call the department head, bureau chief, or representative of the separately elected
official to appear before the Litigation Sub-Committee to explain the lack of response.
(f) It shall be the duty of all County employees, officials, agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees,
grantees or persons or businesses seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of eligibility
for County contracts to report, directly and without undue delay, to the Independent Inspector General any
and all information concerning conduct which they know to involve corruption, allegations of political
discrimination in nonexempt positions or other criminal activity, by another County employee or official,
which concerns his or her office of employment or County related transaction. The knowing failure of any
employee to report as required above shall constitute cause for discipline up to and including termination.
For purposes of this Section, a report made to the Inspector General Hotline shall be considered a direct
report.

TO WORK TOGETHER ON A COURT UTILIZATION STUDY
WHEREAS, based on Clerk of the Circuit Court for Cook County data for 2016 and 2017, there has been
a 47.8% decline in new court cases over the last 10 years across all case types. More specifically, there has
been a 35.4% decline in civil cases, a 56.8% decline in criminal cases, and a 49.5% decline in traffic cases;
and
WHEREAS, this continued decline in case volume suggests that the Circuit Court of Cook County’s 333
courtrooms, originally built to handle the large case volume of the 1970s and 1980s, may currently have
excess capacity; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Circuit Court Branch Court locations are in some of the poorest physical
conditions of any Cook County court houses, needing $25.3 million in repairs over the next 10 years; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Criminal Justice Stakeholders are working continuously and cooperatively
to safely reduce the financial burden of operating the criminal justice system upon Cook County taxpayers;
and
WHEREAS, effective reforms may be instituted only with the support of comprehensive data, accessible
to and acceptable to all of the stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, in light of the need for functional and safe courthouses for the efficient operations of the Cook
County Circuit Court System as well the aging facilities, there is a need to determine what resources will
be needed in the future and what alternatives are available to secure those resources; and
WHEREAS, a courtroom utilization study should be performed so that the use of the Cook County Circuit
Court courtrooms (including Branch Courts and District Court Houses) may be maximized, with court calls
correctly sized and scheduled based on a complete understanding of when, for how long and in what ways,
courtrooms are used; and
WHEREAS, such a study should be obtained from an appropriate vendor, capable of providing a brief but
comprehensive report outlining the best practices and recent trends. The scope of the study should include
but not be limited to:
A review of the existing documents and reports prepared by the Bureau of Asset Management
including but not limited to space utilization plans and Facilities Building Assessment reports;
A review of the needs for the judicial system and its’ associated spaces;
A review of the organizational needs for each of the public safety offices;
Proposed solutions for reallocation & reorganization; and
Probable cost(s) for the work proposed.
WHEREAS, the commissioned study shall also at a minimum include a break downs of the following:
Number of cases heard;

Management Services, all the public safety offices including the Office of the Chief Judge, Sheriff’s Office,
Public Defender’s Office, State’s Attorney’s Office, Clerk of the Circuit Court’s Office and the Justice
Advisory Council shall participate in the planning process and provide any and all necessary data and
evidence needed for the study, excluding any data and evidence limited by law; and
WHEREAS, time is of the essence and to the extent possible the project should be completed as quickly
as possible but no later than May, 2018; and
WHEREAS, the courtroom utilization study will provide valuable guidance for further consideration of
the investment of general revenue in the operation as well as repair and rehabilitation of courtrooms used
by the criminal justice stakeholders and the buildings in which such courtrooms are located.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the public
safety stakeholders work collaboratively with an external vendor managed by the Bureau of Asset
