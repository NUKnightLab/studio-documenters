3. The large triangular gable on the front façade shall utilize wood detailing

6. The proposed 1-story garage in the south side yard shall have a gable clad
with either smooth finish cement fiber clapboard or wood clapboard to match
that of the main residence. Alternatively a hipped roof would also be
compatible.
6. 1565-79 N. Milwaukee
1st Ward

 7. 1060 W. Addison
44th Ward
Wrigley Field
Proposed refurbishment of the marquee at the corner of Clark and Addison.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. Considering the interior framing of the historic marquee sign is deteriorated
and structurally deficient, per the WJE report dated 1/25/16, the sign panels
may be carefully removed as needed and a new interior structure installed.
All of the front porcelain enamel faces shall be salvaged and reinstalled onto
the new structure reusing the existing fastener locations. The side sheet metal
panels shall be salvaged and further analysis done to determine if any side
panels in good condition can be reinstalled. The rear panels, which are not
visible from the street and have been cut with various access panels may be
reinforced/reinstalled or replaced as necessary;
2. Once the rear panels and a small section of side panels have been removed, a
site visit with WJE and Historic Preservation staff to the sign shop shall be
scheduled;
3. The many existing paint layers over the original porcelain enamel front faces
of the historic marquee may be stripped using the gentlest means possible to
prepare for new paint finish. Proposed paint stripping method and sample test
shall be reviewed for approval by WJE and Historic Preservation staff. As
proposed the new paint shall match the existing red and white color scheme,
which although not original has gained significance over time. The original
“Cubs” removable letters shall be salvaged and reinstalled and new neon
lighting shall be installed to match the existing with upgrades to the housing
and attachments as needed for UL and code compliance;
4. As proposed, the LED digital sign installed in 1983 at the bottom part of the
marquee may be replaced and upgraded to match the existing in size and
general appearance for both on and off settings, consistent with the approved
Master Sign Program dated 12/4/14. A different visual appearance of the sign
messaging/image display from what currently exists is not approved at this
time and would require additional review and future approval;
5. Shop drawings, mock-ups of the neon lighting, and new paint samples shall be
reviewed for approval by WJE and Historic Preservation staff; and,
6. The results of any additional analysis and final extent of repair and
replacement work to the marquee will be brought back to the PRC for an
informational update at a future meeting.
