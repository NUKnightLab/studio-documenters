INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL CANDIDATE LIST
AND SELECTION COMMITTEE
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 17, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
As you aware the Cook County Bar Association and the Chicago Bar Association have completed their
considerable task in compiling a Candidate List and recommending three (3) duly qualified candidates for
the position of Independent Inspector General. This task involved an arduous, delicate, and protracted
process intended to attract, by way of independent and third party evaluation, candidates of substance and
integrity who truly possess a commitment to good government. The People of Cook County deserve
nothing less.
I hereby communicate, in alphabetical order, the names of the candidates which the Cook County Bar
Association and the Chicago Bar Association have deemed most suited for inclusion in the Candidate
List: Patrick Blanchard, Office of the State’s Attorney of Cook County, Division Chief, Special
Litigation Division; Joseph M. Ferguson, United States’ Attorney’s Office, Northern District of Illinois,
Deputy Chief, Money Laundering and Forfeiture Section; and Robert E. Williams, Los Angeles Unified
School District, Deputy Inspector General, Investigations.
Further, pursuant to § 2-282(b)(1)(b) of the Independent Inspector General Ordinance, I am required to
appoint a Selection Committee to which I must submit the Candidate List. The Selection Committee,
which is comprised of two (2) Democratic Commissioners and two (2) Republican Commissioners, the
Cook County State’s Attorney, and the Director of the Board of Ethics, is charged with conducting
interviews and any other such investigations necessary to determine which candidate from the Candidate
List shall be submitted to the full Board of Commissioners for advice and consent.

6751

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
With respect to my selection of Commissioners to be appointed to the Selection Committee, I am
appointing the ranking Commissioners from each party as their longevity in tenure provides a portal of
insight and wisdom regarding the history of our local government, and is a testament to their commitment
to the People of Cook County.
I hereby communicate the names of the six (6) members of the Selection Committee: Commissioner Jerry
Butler, 3rd District; Commissioner John P. Daley, 11th District; Commissioner Peter N. Silvestri, 9th
District; Commissioner Gregg Goslin, 14th District; Richard A. Devine, Esq., Cook County State’s
Attorney; and Marynic Foster, Esq., Director of the Cook County Board of Ethics.
Please be advised that § 2-282(b)(1)(b) of the Independent Inspector General Ordinance sets forth the
Selection Committee’s deadline for selection of a candidate from the Candidate List and submission of
same to the full Board of Commissioners. I advise the Selection Committee to act as swiftly as is prudent
as the candidates from the Candidate List are highly qualified and sought after.
Pursuant to § 2-282(b)(5) of the Independent Inspector General Ordinance, I am also instructing the
Bureau of Human Resources to immediately commence background checks of the candidates and to
present its findings to the Selection Committee in advance of the Selection Committee’s interviews of the
candidates. Additionally, please know my staff is available to assist the Selection Committee in any
manner necessary to further the purpose of the Selection Committee.
Finally, I would be remised if I did not thank the Cook County Bar Association and the Chicago Bar
Association, all their respective members, and the members of the Cook County Bar Association/Chicago
Bar Association Joint Search Committee for their roles in this difficult and significant task, a task crucial
to reforming County government and making County government more transparent and accountable.
Their hard work and dedication to this endeavor is appreciated greater than words can express.
A new day is upon us and the appointment of the Independent Inspector General will aid in the
transparency and accountability of our government to the People it serves.

CALLING FOR A HEARING ON THE ALLEGED CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
AT COOK COUNTY JAIL
WHEREAS, recently, the U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights
Division released a 98-page report detailing wide-scale problems at Cook County Jail, ranging from
medical negligence to excessive force by jail guards; and

6759

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
WHEREAS, the federal officials released the report at the conclusion of a 17-month investigation that
was conducted under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”) that allows federal
officials to look into constitutional rights violations at detention and correctional facilities; and
WHEREAS, the CRIPA report concluded that Cook County Jail is systematically violating the basic
constitutional rights of its inmates and the Justice Department threatened legal action if steps are not taken
to ensure protections of those rights; and
WHEREAS, the CRIPA report also claimed that the jail hospital, Cermak Health Services of Cook
County, failed to provide constitutionally required standards of medical care to the inmates; and
WHEREAS, recognizing that Cook County Jail is the nation’s largest single-site correctional facility
with 3,800 sheriff’s office personnel overseeing approximately 10,000 inmates daily, U.S. Attorney
Patrick Fitzgerald stated in a news conference that a key part of the problem at Cook County Jail is
inadequate staffing which places inmates and personnel in imminent danger; and
WHEREAS, understaffing and overcrowding at the jail have been longtime problems and led to the
appointment of a federal judge to monitor overcrowding for the past 25 years; and
WHEREAS, since taking office in 2006, Sheriff Thomas J. Dart has sought to increase prison guard
accountability and reduce inmate violence and overcrowding through corrective action and various reform
measures; and
WHEREAS, Sheriff Dart claims the CRIPA report ignores these reform efforts and “categorically
rejects” the CRIPA report’s “allegations of systemic violation of civil rights at the jail”; and
WHEREAS, U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald has called on the Cook County Board and Sheriff Tom Dart to
institute immediate reforms at Cook County Jail that will satisfy constitutional standards and fix a
dangerous jail that is “woefully inadequate.”
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee of
the Cook County Board will convene for the purpose of holding a hearing to analyze the CRIPA report
and the effectiveness of current and future reforms by the Sheriff’s Office and Cermak Health Services of
Cook County that seek to remedy the alleged civil rights violations at Cook County Jail.

DECLARING AUGUST 29, 2008 AS “VETERANS AWARENESS DAY”
WHEREAS, millions of patriots have served in the Armed Forces of the United States during the past
century. Hundreds of thousands of them made the supreme sacrifice for our nation during their call of
duty, yet many of them have received little respect or honor from this nation for their brave and heroic
contributions; and
WHEREAS, the enormous sacrifices of these men and women who have served in the Armed Forces
have been vital in preserving the freedoms, as well as the way of life enjoyed by the people of this nation
today; and
WHEREAS, during times of extreme emergency, these honorable and courageous heroes have stepped
forward to serve the country by placing the welfare of the nation before that of their own lives. These
veterans have not only guaranteed liberty, peace and freedom for the citizens of the United States but they
have also striven to effectively establish the exercise of those qualities for other nations throughout the
world; and
WHEREAS, there has been a substantial decrease in awareness as well as importance placed on the
accomplishments of those who have served in the Armed Forces despite the current educational efforts of
the Department of Veterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations. It is essential that the future
leaders of this nation recognize the history of military actions as well as the accompanying contribution
and significant sacrifice made by all veterans who have provided such dedicated service and protection
for this nation and its citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the Cook County Board of Commissioners,
assembled here this 22nd of July, 2008 AD, do hereby declare this August 29, 2008 as “Veterans
Awareness Day” throughout Cook County and encourage all citizens to reflect on the heroic services by

STATE’S ATTORNEY, Richard A. Devine, submitting communication advising the County
of the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator regarding Jimmy Doe v.
County of Cook, USDC No. 99-C-3945. This class action litigation was originally brought in
1999 and has subsequently involved the entry of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
between the parties that was approved by the District Court in December 2002 and the entry
of an Agreed Supplemental Order approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. Plaintiffs,
represented by the Roger Baldwin Foundation of the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) and the firm of Kirkland & Ellis, filed a Motion for Appointment of a Receiver on
May 29, 2007. This petition was resolved by the entry of an Agreed Order Appointing a
Transitional Administrator by the District Court on August 14, 2007. The Board of
Commissioners agreed to the entry of the subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
In accordance with the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator, paragraph
7(c-e), Cook County is required to set aside funds for the reasonable costs and expenses of
the Office of the Transitional Administrator (OTA). On June 18, 2008, the District Court
entered an order amending this portion of the TA Order permitting the Transitional
Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a separate account to be disbursed by him for the
sole purpose of satisfying the reasonable costs and expenses of the staff of the OTA. The
account managed by the Transitional Administrator shall be subject to audit as determined by

COOK COUNTY ASSESSOR, James M. Houlihan, by Michael A. Stone, Chief Deputy
Assessor, transmitting a Communication, dated June 4, 2008:

6848

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $73,000.00 from the
MacArthur Foundation for support of affordable housing programs related to The
Preservation Compact. The grant is a vital part of the Assessor’s Office’s initiative to
improve operations and increase awareness of certain property tax advantages available to
affordable housing. The funds would be used to improve necessary information systems and
to target housing agencies, developers and the general public though awareness programs. If
these actions are not taken, Cook County risks losing thousands of units of affordable housing
every year, while demand for such housing is projected to only increase for the foreseeable
future.
This grant does not require a cash match. As such, the grant will have no fiscal impact on
Cook County.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $73,000.00. Funding period: June 1, 2008
through May 31, 2011.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents, and determined the fiscal
impact on Cook County, if any.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 07/01/08.
COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER MURPHY, MOVED THAT
THE REQUEST OF THE ASSESSOR (COMMUNICATION NO. 294912) BE APPROVED. THE
MOTION CARRIED.

Sec. 2-6.

Building construction.

(a)
In this section the term "Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)"
means a green building rating system promulgated by the United States Green Building Council
(USGBC) that provides specific principles and practices, some mandatory but the majority discretionary,
that may be applied during the design, construction, and operation phases, which enable the building to be
awarded points from reaching present standards of environmental efficiency so that it may achieve LEED
certification from the USGBC as a "green" building, as such rating system exists on November 7, 2002.

6852

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
(b)
The County does hereby order the Department of Capital Planning and Policy to take the
steps necessary to assure that all newly constructed buildings and all buildings scheduled for capital
improvement are designed, built, and operated in accordance with the standards and requirements of the
LEED Green Building Rating System, Version 2.0, and does further order that each new building must
meet the requirements for LEED certification.
(c)
The USGBC intends to release a revised version of the LEED Green Building Rating
System every three years; and Cook County shall refer to the most current version of the LEED when
beginning a new building construction permit project or renovation.
(d)
With specific regard to the LEED Energy and Atmosphere category, because achieving
increasing levels of energy performance above the set energy code standards is the surest way of realizing
significant operational cost savings, all buildings shall set a goal to obtain a total of at least eight points in
this category.
(e)
The County also orders that LEED Existing Building rating system be used during
retrofit projects of its current standing structures and does further order that each retrofitted building shall
meet the requirements for LEED certification for existing buildings.
(f)
New construction and major renovation projects shall incorporate bird-safe building
materials and design features, including, but not limited to, those recommended by the City of Chicago’s
“Bird-Safe Building Design Guide for New Construction and Renovation,” the City of Toronto’s “BirdFriendly Development Guidelines,” and New York City Audubon’s “Bird-Safe Building Guidelines.”

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008

Chairman Murphy asked Bruce Washington, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, to address
the committee.
Mr. Washington began by stating that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy is a proponent of the
Ordinance.
Mr. Washington stated that in regards to cost, clearly with new construction the cost is nominal; any type
of bird fitting design would be incorporated into the design, so therefore the cost would be negligible.
Mr. Washington stated as the County moves into retrofitting the buildings and trying to make them bird
friendly, there are a number of things that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has considered: 1)
installing transparent or perforated pattern or nonreflecting window film; 2) painting, etching or
temporary coating collation windows to make them visible to birds; 3) louvers, awnings, sun shades or
other shading devices at large expanses of glass to reduce the reflection.
In addition the Office of Capital Planning and Policy can install and operate reflected blinds, shades, or
curtains to reduce glazing reflectivity and indicate the presence of a barrier to a bird in flight. The other
option would be to consider closing curtains when the buildings are illuminated at night or perhaps if
there are no activities going on at night in the building to reduce the illumination being used by that
building. Finally the other consideration would be to reglaze the existing windows that experience a high
rate of bird coalition with low reflectivity.
In conclusion, Mr. Washington stated that when you’re looking at window film the cost would be
approximately five dollars per square foot. If we install shades they would run anywhere from $20.00 to
$135.00 per square foot. Once the direction is received by the Board, the Office of Capital Planning and
Policy will look at the various conditions and look at what buildings are good candidates for the retrofit to
make them bird friendly.
Chairman Murphy asked if all of the County buildings have some type of shading or curtains on them
already.
Mr. Washington responded that most of the buildings have shades or curtains. It is more of a building
operation or policy by the County to direct or instruct the various departments to close their shades at a
certain time or turn off the lights at certain time of the day if there is no operation going on in the
building. At this time there is no policy that exists; the County has a total of 105 buildings.
Chairman Murphy stated that the first order of business would be to institute a policy particularly during
migratory periods of the year such that the County follows a period of closing drapes/shades and turning
off lights which would cost the County no money.
Commissioner Quigley asked who is responsible for implementing a policy.
Mr. Washington stated that the Department of Facilities Management will implement the policy for all of
the buildings that are outside of the Bureau of Health Services. For the Bureau of Health Services, it
would be the Bureau itself that would operate the policy.
Commissioner Sims asked if there are any funds available through the Federal government to help the
County with the retrofitting that needs to be completed.

6855

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
Mr. Washington stated that there could be, but grant funds are difficult to obtain. The Office of Capital
Planning and Policy does have a grant writer on staff and efforts are being made by that individual to
secure funds. Further he stated that we can not assume that the County will be receiving funds soon, but
could apply for funds.
Commissioner Butler asked if the retrofitting will only be for buildings that Cook County owns or does it
include all buildings under construction in Cook County.
Mr. Washington stated that it is his understanding that it would only be for buildings that Cook County
owns.
Commissioner Quigley stated that Mayor Daley has been outstanding regarding this issue and the City of
Chicago has already implemented its bird policies and has begun to deal with the issue across the City.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the zoning and building authority of the County is limited to
unincorporated areas only. He stated that he would like to work with Commissioner Quigley to draft an
amendment to the building code of the unincorporated areas basically to require that new construction
incorporate these standards. Further, he stated that as a body the suburban municipalities should be
encouraged to look at incorporating the County into their local building codes.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Vice Chairman Butler, moved the approval of
Communication No. 293643. The motion carried unanimously.

AUTOMATED BOARD AGENDA PROJECT. Transmitting a Communication from
Todd H. Stroger, President and David Orr, Cook County Clerk:
Dear Members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners:
President Todd H. Stroger is committed to applying technology to improve performance
and create efficiency in government. The Bureau of Technology’s Vision 2010 Strategic
Plan sets forth the guidelines for improvements.
In keeping with this Vision, the Office of the President and the County Clerk are
developing a countywide web-based Automated Board Agenda (ABA) application to be
implemented in partnership with the Bureau of Technology.
The ABA tool in development will allow authorized users to create and submit automatic
transmittals for inclusion on the County Board Agenda eliminating duplication of efforts
and additional traffic on our email and network systems resulting in a seamless and
integrated agenda creation process, with shared technology, from initiation to final
product.
For this to be successful, all elected officials, bureaus and departments of Cook County
government that have business before the County Board must adopt the ABA system for
processing agenda items. Execution of the ABA is scheduled for the beginning of
FY2009 with the December 3, 2008 County Board Meeting.
We are requesting to present a project overview and discuss technology requirements,
training and implementation at a meeting of the Committee on Information Technology
& Automation.
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology & Automation on June 17,
2008.

Antonio Hylton, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Technology, delivered opening remarks on behalf
of the Bureau of Technology and President Todd H. Stroger’s Agenda on Technology. He noted that the
Automated Board Agenda program has significant potential for efficiencies, and that it provides the
President with the ability to manage the agenda process with more efficiency and timeliness.
Joy Wykowski, Deputy Clerk of the Cook County Board, delivered the following remarks:
The Automated Board Agenda application is a web-based application. This program will preclude the
need for paper documents. It will no longer be necessary to hand deliver to the Clerk’s Office those items
with department head’s signatures. Items will be created in the application and the whole process will go
through an automated life cycle. It will be possible to follow an item from its initial creation to its final
approval by the Board.
A demonstration of this program was conducted at the Draft Agenda Meeting on July 8, 2008. Today’s
demonstration is for Commissioners and department heads. Training for the program will be held in
August.

6859

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008

For the last Board meeting of Fiscal Year 2008, on November 19, 2008, the Agenda will be created on the
web application as well as through the current paper process. The web-based system will go live and
replace the paper system with the first meeting of the new fiscal year, December 3, 2008.
The contract with Catalyst Corporation, the developer of this program, was approved on March 7, 2008
by the Information Technology & Automation Committee, and then approved by the full Board on March
18, 2008.
Brittany Carminati, Senior Consultant/Software Engineer, Catalyst Corporation, conducted an extended
demonstration of the system. Chairman Beavers asked her to show how to enter an item for submission
onto the agenda, and Ms. Carminati demonstrated this, walking through the process.
Commissioner Daley inquired as to the cost of this project.
Ms. Wykowski replied that the web design cost $175,000.00 and that the project management cost
$45,000.00, for a total cost of $220,000.00. She further stated that a cost/benefit analysis of the project
yields a total annual reduction of $91,000.00 which includes one staff person; in 2.4 years the cost of the
project will be recouped.
Chairman Beavers asked whether anyone in the audience had questions.
Anthony Del Santo, Acting Chief Technical Officer, Cook County’s Sheriff’s Office, inquired whether
the system will email the user submitting the item as to whether the item was approved.
Ms. Wykowski replied in the negative that the system generates emails only when an action is required,
and then explained that the user could check the system for the disposition of the item.
John Mason, Executive Assistant to the Director of the Department of Planning and Development,
inquired: Regarding the submission of items, will there be a summary screen showing all items that have
been submitted?
Ms. Wykowski replied in the affirmative. She also explained that there is a change history for each item
which, details the life cycle of that item.
Mr. Mason further inquired whether the system can retrieve text from Microsoft Word documents.
Ms. Wykowski replied that documents can be copied and pasted into the application.

Sec. 4.

Book-Entry Provisions.

The Bonds shall be initially issued in the form of a separate single fully registered Bond for each
of the maturities of each Series of the Bonds. Upon initial issuance, the ownership of each such Bond
shall be registered in the Bond Register in such name as may be provided by the Depository (the “Book
Entry Owner”) and, accordingly, in Book Entry Form as provided and defined herein. Any Designated
Officer is authorized to execute a Representations Letter or to utilize the provisions of an existing
Representations Letter. Without limiting the generality of the authority given with respect to entering into
the Representations Letter for the Bonds, it may contain provisions relating to (i) payment procedures,
(ii) transfers of the Bonds or of beneficial interests therein, (iii) redemption notices and procedures unique
to the Depository, (iv) additional notices or communications, and (v) amendment from time to time to
conform with changing customs and practices with respect to securities industry transfer and payment
practices. With respect to Bonds registered in the Bond Register in the name of the Book Entry Owner,
neither the County nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation to any broker-dealer, bank,
or other financial institution for which the Depository holds Bonds from time to time as securities
depository (each such broker-dealer, bank, or other financial institution being referred to herein as a
“Depository Participant”) or to any person on behalf of whom such a Depository Participant holds an
interest in the Bonds. Without limiting the meaning of the immediately preceding sentence, neither the
County nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation with respect to (a) the accuracy of the
records of the Depository, the Book Entry Owner, or any Depository Participant with respect to any
ownership interest in the Bonds; (b) the delivery to any Depository Participant or any other person, other
than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register or as expressly provided in the
Representations Letter, of any notice with respect to the Bonds, including any notice of redemption; or
(c) the payment to any Depository Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a
Bond as shown in the Bond Register, of any amount with respect to principal of or interest on, or Maturity
Amount of, the Bonds. No person other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register
shall receive a Bond certificate with respect to any Bond. In the event that (x) the County determines that
the Depository is incapable of discharging its responsibilities described herein or in the Representations
Letter, (y) the agreement among the County and the Depository evidenced by the Representations Letter
shall be terminated for any reason, or (z) the County determines that it is in the best interests of the

6888

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
County or of the beneficial owners of the Bonds that they be able to obtain certificated Bonds; the County
shall notify the Depository of the availability of Bond certificates, and the Bonds shall no longer be
restricted to being registered in the Bond Register to the Book Entry Owner. The County may determine
at such time that the Bonds shall be registered in the name of and deposited with a successor depository
operating a book entry only system, as may be acceptable to the County, or such depository’s agent or
designee, but if the County does not select such successor depository, then the Bonds shall be registered
in whatever name or names registered owners of Bonds transferring or exchanging Bonds shall designate,
in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Sec. 5.

Redemption.

A.
Mandatory Redemption. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, any
Bonds may be issued as Term Bonds and be subject to mandatory redemption by operation of the Bond
Fund, in the case of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds, at a price of par, without premium,
plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, and in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds at a
price of Compound Accreted Value calculated to the date fixed for redemption, on November 15 of the
years and in the amounts as shall be set forth in the relevant Bond Order. The County covenants that it
will redeem Term Bonds pursuant to the mandatory redemption requirement for such Term Bonds and
provide Pledged Taxes accordingly.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal
amounts of such Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier
optional redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds credited against future
mandatory redemption requirements in such order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief
Financial Officer may determine. In the absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of
such Bonds shall be credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological
order of such payments beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the
amount subject to mandatory redemption in the year preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on
or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day preceding any mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may, and if
directed by the Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not
exceeding the amount of such Bonds required to be retired on such mandatory redemption date and at a
price not exceeding par plus accrued interest. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the
principal amount thereof shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory
redemption date.
The County shall provide the Trustee with written notice of such reduction, which notice shall be
given within thirty (30) days after such redemption or purchase, and the Trustee shall promptly give
written notice of the same to the Bondholders, in the manner hereinafter provided.
B.
Optional Redemption. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, any Bonds
may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part on any date, at such
times and at such redemption prices (to be expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of Current
Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds to be redeemed and as a percentage of the Compound Accreted
Value of Capital Appreciation Bonds to be redeemed) not to exceed one hundred three percent
(103.00%), plus, in the case of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds, accrued interest to the date
of redemption, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof. If less than all
of the Outstanding Bonds of a Series are to be optionally redeemed, the Bonds to be called shall be called
from such Series, in such principal amounts and from such maturities as may be determined by the
County and within any maturity by lot within a maturity in the manner hereinafter provided. The terms
and provisions for any redemption of Variable Rate Bonds shall be as determined by the Chief Financial
Officer at the time of sale of the Bonds and as set forth in a relevant Indenture, provided that such terms
shall be within the limitations set forth in this Section.

6889

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
C.
Redemption Procedure. The Bonds subject to redemption shall be identified, notice
given, and paid and redeemed pursuant to the procedures as follows.
1.

Redemption Notice. For a mandatory redemption of Term Bonds, unless otherwise
notified by the County, the Trustee shall proceed to redeem the Term Bonds without any
further order or direction from the County hereunder or otherwise. For an optional
redemption, the County shall, at least forty-five (45) days prior to any optional
redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such redemption date and of the principal amount and maturities of Bonds
to be redeemed.

2.

Selection of Bonds within a Maturity. Current Interest Bonds shall be redeemed only in
the principal amount of $5,000 each and integral multiples thereof, and Capital
Appreciation Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts representing $5,000 Maturity
Amount and integral multiples thereof. For purposes of any redemption of less than all of
the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed
shall be selected by lot by the Trustee for the Bonds of such maturity by such method of
lottery as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided, that such lottery shall
provide for the selection for redemption of Bonds or portions thereof so that each $5,000
principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such Bond shall be as likely to
be called for redemption as any other such $5,000 Bond or $5,000 portion. The Trustee
shall make such selection (a) upon or prior to the time of the giving of official notice of
redemption, or (b) in the event of a refunding or defeasance, upon advice from the
County that certain Bonds have been refunded or defeased and are no longer Outstanding
as defined.

3.

Official Notice of Redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing
of the Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond
selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Unless
waived by the registered owner of Bonds to be redeemed, official notice of any such
redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the County by mailing the
redemption notice by first class U.S. mail not less than thirty (30) days and not more than
sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the
Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such
other address as is furnished in writing by such registered owner to the Trustee. All
official notices of redemption shall include the name of the Bonds and at least the
information as follows:
(a)

the redemption date;

(b)

the redemption price;

(c)

if less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series and of a particular maturity
are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of
Bonds of a Series within such maturity, the respective principal amounts) of the
Bonds to be redeemed;

(d)

a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due
and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and
that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from and after said date; and

6890

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
(e)

the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption
price, which place of payment shall be the office designated for that purpose of
the Trustee.

4.

Conditional Redemption. Unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of the
Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of such
notice of redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that said
redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or
prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such moneys are not received, such notice shall
be of no force and effect, the County shall not redeem such Bonds, and the Trustee shall
give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such
moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.

5.

Bonds Shall Become Due. Official notice of redemption having been given as described,
the Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be redeemed shall, subject to the stated condition in
paragraph 4. immediately preceding, on the redemption date, become due and payable at
the redemption price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the County
shall default in the payment of the redemption price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance
with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. The
procedure for the payment of interest due as part of the redemption price shall be as
herein provided for payment of interest otherwise due.

6.

Insufficiency in Notice Not Affecting Other Bonds; Failure to Receive Notice; Waiver.
Neither the failure to mail such redemption notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed,
to any particular registered owner of a Bond, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice
with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been properly given, failure of a
registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to invalidate, limit
or delay the effect of the notice or redemption action described in the notice. Such notice
may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond entitled to receive such notice,
either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by registered owners shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing
shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. In lieu of the foregoing official notice, so long as the Bonds are held in book
entry form, notice may be given as provided in the Representation Letter, and the giving
of such notice shall constitute a waiver by the Depository and the book entry owner, as
registered owner, of the foregoing notice. After giving proper notification of redemption
to the Trustee, as applicable, the County shall not be liable for any failure to give or
defect in notice.

7.

New Bond in Amount Not Redeemed. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of like
Series and tenor, of Authorized Denominations, of the same maturity, and bearing the
same rate of interest in the amount of the unpaid principal.

6891

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008

Sec. 6.

8.

Effect of Nonpayment upon Redemption. If any Bond or portion of Bond called for
redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, in the case of
Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption
date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption; in the case
of Variable Rate Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest as provided in a
relevant Indenture; and, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound
Accreted Value at such redemption date shall continue to accrue interest from such
redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital Appreciation Bond, or
portion thereof, so called for redemption.

9.

Bonds to Be Cancelled; Payment to Identify Bonds. All Bonds which have been
redeemed shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.
Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other
transfer of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identifying, by
issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or other
transfer.

10.

Additional Notice. The County agrees to provide such additional notice of redemption as
it may deem advisable at such time as it determines to redeem Bonds, taking into account
any requirements or guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board, the Government Accounting Standards Board, or any other
federal or state agency having jurisdiction or authority in such matters; provided,
however, that such additional notice shall be (a) advisory in nature, (b) solely in the
discretion of the County (unless a separate agreement shall be made), (c) not be a
condition precedent of a valid redemption or a part of the Bond contract, and (d) any
failure or defect in such notice shall not delay or invalidate the redemption of Bonds for
which proper official notice shall have been given. Reference is also made to the
provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking of the County with respect to the
Bonds, which may contain other provisions relating to notice of redemption of Bonds.

11.

Trustee to Advise County. As part of its duties hereunder, the Trustee shall prepare and
forward to the County a statement as to notices given with respect to each redemption
together with copies of the notices as mailed.
Registration of Bonds; Persons Treated as Owners; Bonds Lost, Destroyed, Etc.

The County shall cause the Bond Register to be kept at the office maintained for the purpose by
the Trustee, which is hereby constituted and appointed the Registrar of the County. The County is
authorize d to prepare, and the Trustee shall keep custody of, multiple Bond blanks executed by the
County for use in the transfer and exchange of Bonds.
Subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Bonds in Book Entry Form, any Bond may be
transferred or exchanged, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations of and upon payment of the
charges as set forth in this Ordinance. Upon surrender for transfer of any Bond at the office maintained
for the purpose by the Trustee, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments
of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and duly executed by, the registered owner or his or her
attorney duly authorized in writing, the County shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, date and
deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees (i) in the case of any Capital Appreciation Bond, a new
fully registered Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds of the same Series and of the same Stated Maturity
of Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate Original Principal Amount or (ii) in the case of any
Current Interest Bond or Variable Rate Bond, a new fully registered Bond or Bonds of the same Series of

6892

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
the same tenor, of the same interest rate and Stated Maturity, of Authorized Denominations, for a like
aggregate principal amount. Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to Book Entry Form any
Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee or its proper agent for
a like aggregate Original Principal Amount of Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds of the same Series and
maturity of other Authorized Denominations; and any fully registered Current Interest Bond or Bonds or
Variable Rate Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee or its proper agent for a like
aggregate principal amount of such Bonds of the same tenor, of the same Series, interest rate and Stated
Maturity, of other Authorized Denominations.
The Trustee shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Bond during the period from the
close of business on the Regular Record Date for an interest payment to the opening of business on such
interest payment date or during the period of fifteen (15) days preceding the giving of notice of
redemption of Bonds or to transfer or exchange any Bond all or a portion of which has been called for
redemption.
The execution by the County of any fully registered Bond shall constitute full and due
authorization of such Bond, and the Trustee or its proper agent shall thereby be authorized to authenticate,
date and deliver such Bond in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance and of any Indenture;
provided, however, the principal amount of Bonds of each Series and maturity authenticated by the
Trustee shall not at any one time exceed the authorized principal amount of Bonds for such Series and
maturity less the amount of such Bonds which have been paid. .
The person in whose name any Bond shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the
absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on
or any Maturity Amount of any Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner
thereof or his or her legal representative. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.
No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the County or the
Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Bonds exchanged in the case of the issuance of
a Bond or Bonds for the outstanding portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.
If any Bond, whether in temporary or definitive form, is lost (whether by reason of theft or
otherwise), destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly
cancelled, the Trustee or its proper agent may authenticate a new Bond of like Series, date, maturity date,
interest rate (or, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, Yield to Maturity), denomination and Original
Principal Amount (in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds) or principal amount (in the case of other
Bonds) and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding; provided that (a) in the case of any
mutilated Bond, such mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the Trustee, and (b) in the case of any
lost Bond or Bond destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss
or destruction, together with indemnification of the County and the Trustee, satisfactory to the Trustee. In
the event any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall have matured or is about to mature, or
has been called for redemption, instead of issuing a duplicate Bond, the Trustee shall pay the same
without surrender thereof if there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss, destruction
or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any substitute Bond, the
Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in relation thereto.

Sec. 7.

Security.

The full faith and credit of the County are hereby irrevocably pledged to the punctual payment of
the principal of, interest on and Maturity Amount of the Bonds. The Bonds shall be direct and general
obligations of the County and the County shall be obligated and hereby covenants and agrees to levy ad
valorem taxes upon all the taxable property in the County for the payment of the Bonds and the interest
thereon, without limitation as to rate or amount. The County hereby pledges, as equal and ratable security
for the Bonds, all present and future proceeds of the Pledged Taxes on deposit in the Bond Fund for the
sole benefit of the registered owners of the Bonds, subject to the right, hereby expressly reserved by the
County, to transfer certain interest income or investment profit earned in the Bond Fund to other funds of
the County.
Sec. 8.

Forms of Bonds.

The Current Interest Bonds and the Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be in substantially the forms
hereinafter set forth; provided, however, that if the text of the Bonds is to be printed in its entirety on the
front side of the Bonds, then the second paragraph on the front side and the legend “See Reverse Side for
Additional Provisions” shall be omitted and the text of paragraphs set forth for the reverse side shall be
inserted immediately after the first paragraph. The Convertible CABs shall be prepared incorporating the
provisions of the forms of Current Interest Bonds and Capital Appreciation Bonds set forth below as
necessary to reflect the terms and provisions of the sale of the Convertible CABs pursuant to Section 11
hereof. Variable Rate Bonds shall be prepared in substantially the form provided in the relevant
Indenture.
Sec. 9.

Taxes Levied; Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest; Covenants re Pledged
Taxes; Ordinance and Bond Orders to be Filed; Abatement.

A.
Taxes Levied. For the purpose of providing the funds required to pay the principal of and
interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds promptly as the same become due, there is hereby levied
upon all taxable property in the County, a direct annual tax sufficient for those purposes in addition to all
other taxes, for the years and in the amounts as shall be provided in each relevant Bond Order, which
amounts, when aggregated with (i) for any Series of Refunding Bonds, the receipts, if any, of taxes levied
and collected for the payment of Refunded Bonds, (ii) any accrued interest received on the sale of a Series
of Bonds, and (iii) any proceeds of a Series of Bonds available to pay capitalized interest on said Series of
Bonds, shall be sufficient to pay principal of and interest on the Bonds provided, however, that the
amount of Pledged Taxes levied for any one calendar year shall not exceed $_______________. For this
purpose, interest to accrue on Variable Rate Bonds shall be deemed to be that rate which, in the
reasonable estimation of the Chief Financial Officer as she may from time to time determine, will be
sufficient to pay principal of and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds when due.
B.
Payment of Principal, Interest and Maturity Amount. Subject to the right reserved by the
County under Section 7 of this Ordinance to transfer investment income, the Bond Moneys shall be
applied by the Trustee to pay principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds.
Principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds coming due at any time when
there are insufficient funds on hand from the Pledged Taxes to pay the same shall be paid promptly when
due from current funds on hand in advance of the collection of the Pledged Taxes herein levied which
funds are hereby appropriated for such purpose as necessary; and when the Pledged Taxes shall have been
collected, reimbursement shall be made to said funds in the amount so advanced.

6894

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
C.
Covenants re Pledged Taxes. The County covenants and agrees with the purchasers and
registered owners of the Bonds that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding, the County will take
no action or fail to take any action which in any way would adversely affect the ability of the County to
levy and collect the Pledged Taxes. The County and its officers will comply with all present and future
applicable laws in order to assure that the Pledged Taxes may be levied, extended and collected as
provided herein and deposited into the Bond Fund. With respect to Variable Rate Bonds, in furtherance
of the general obligation full faith and credit pledge of the County to the punctual payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds set forth in Section 7 of this Ordinance, the County will take all
actions necessary to levy in addition to the taxes described above, any direct annual tax required in excess
of that levied in this Ordinance for collection on a timely basis to make all payments of the principal of
and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds.
D.
Ordinance and Bond Orders to be Filed. A copy of this Ordinance, together with a
subsequent copy of each Bond Order, duly certified by the County Clerk, shall be filed in the office of the
County Clerk, and such filings shall constitute the authority for and it shall be the duty of said County
Clerk, in each year as aforesaid, to extend the taxes levied pursuant to this Section and said Bond Order(s)
for collection, such taxes to be in addition to and in excess of all other taxes heretofore or hereafter
authorized to be levied by the County on its behalf.
E.
Abatement. Whenever and only when other funds from any lawful source are made
available for the purpose of paying any principal of and interest on, or Maturity Amount of. the Bonds, so
as to enable the abatement of the Pledged Taxes levied herein for the payment of same, the Corporate
Authorities shall, by proper proceedings, direct the deposit of such funds into the Bond Fund and further
shall direct the abatement of the Pledged Taxes by the amount so deposited. A certified copy or other
notification of any such proceedings abating taxes may then be filed with the County Clerk in a timely
manner to effect such abatement.
Except as may be otherwise provided in a relevant Bond Order or Indenture, at any time and from
time to time as the Chief Financial Officer shall determine to be necessary or advisable, the Chief
Financial Officer is hereby expressly authorized, without further official action of the Corporate
Authorities, to abate any portion of the Pledged Taxes levied to pay principal of and interest on Variable
Rate Bonds, in the event and to the extent that the Chief Financial Officer shall determine that the
collection of such Pledged Taxes will not be necessary to provide for the timely payment of the principal
of and interest on such Variable Rate Bonds. The filing with the County Clerk of a certificate of
abatement, signed by the President and the Chief Financial Officer, shall constitute due authorization for
the County Clerk to effectuate such abatement.
Sec. 10.

The County is duly authorized to pledge the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and
funds purported to be pledged by this Ordinance in the manner and to the extent provided in this

respect to a Series of Bonds shall be attached to the relevant Bond Order filed with the County Clerk

the Bonds and shall be a general obligation of the County for the payment of which, both principal and

interest at a rate not exceeding 18 percent per annum. The President or the Chief Financial Officer is
hereby authorized to execute and deliver each such reimbursement agreement, under the seal of the

Bonds shall remain outstanding for all purposes, not be defeased or otherwise

Bondholders shall continue to exist and shall run to the benefit of the Insurer, and
the Insurer shall be subrogated to the rights of such Bondholders.

connection with bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency plan or proceeding.

H.
Qualified Swap Agreements. The President or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby
authorized to execute and deliver from time to time one or more Qualified Swap Agreements with Swap
Providers selected by the Chief Financial Officer, the purpose of which is to hedge or manage the
County’s interest cost with respect to the Bonds (or any portion thereof), or to reduce the County’s
exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate or rates payable on the Bonds or to insure, protect or preserve
its investments from any loss (including, without limitation, loss caused by fluctuations in interest rates,
markets or in securities). The stated aggregate notional amount under all such Qualified Swap
Agreements authorized hereunder shall not exceed the principal amount of the Bonds issued hereunder
(net of offsetting transactions entered into by the County). Any such Qualified Swap Agreement to the
extent practicable shall be in substantially the form of either the Local Currency - Single Jurisdiction
version or the Multicurrency-Cross Border version of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement accompanied by
a schedule based upon the U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule published by the International Swap
Dealers Association (the “ISDA”) or any successor form to be published by the ISDA, and in the
appropriate confirmations of transactions governed by that agreement, with such insertions, completions
and modifications thereof as shall be approved by the officer of the County executing the same, her
execution to constitute conclusive evidence of the Corporate Authorities’ approval of such insertions,
completions and modifications thereof. Interest Rate Exchange Obligations or other amounts payable by
the County under any such Qualified Swap Agreement (being, collectively, “Swap Payments”) shall
constitute operating expenses of the County payable from any moneys, revenues, receipts, income, assets
or funds of the County available for such purpose or be payable from the Pledged Taxes, as the Chief
Financial Officer may from time to time determine. Swap Payments shall not constitute an indebtedness
of the County for which its full faith and credit is pledged. Nothing contained in this Section shall limit
or restrict the authority of the President or the Chief Financial Officer to enter into similar agreements
pursuant to prior or subsequent authorization of the Corporate Authorities.
Sec. 12.

Creation of Funds and Appropriations; Abatement of Taxes Levied for Refunded
Bonds.

A.
Bond Fund Created. There is hereby created the “General Obligation [Refunding]
Bonds, Series 200__, Bond Fund” (the “Bond Fund”), which shall be the fund for the payment of
principal of and interest on and Maturity Amount of the Bonds.

6899

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
All receipts of the Pledged Taxes received by the County Collector shall be deposited daily, as far
as practicable, with the Trustee. All other moneys appropriated or used by the County for the payment of
the principal or redemption price of, and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Bonds shall be paid to
the Trustee. The Trustee shall be accountable only for moneys actually so deposited with the Trustee.
The Trustee is hereby expressly authorized to establish such accounts within the Bond Fund as shall be
necessary to account for the Pledged Taxes levied for each Series of Bonds issued hereunder. All Pledged
Taxes, and all such moneys, shall be deposited by the Trustee into the Bond Fund.
The County Treasurer and the County Collector are hereby expressly authorized and directed to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to provide for the prompt deposit with the Trustee, in
accordance with this Ordinance, of all Pledged Taxes.
The Bond Fund shall be held and maintained as a separate and segregated account by the Trustee.
The Trustee may create Accounts within the Bond Fund as necessary for any Series of Bonds as specified
in a relevant Bond Order or, for Variable Rate Bonds, as provided in a relevant Indenture. Accrued
interest, capitalized interest and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds shall be deposited
into the Bond Fund and be applied to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds.
The Pledged Taxes shall either be deposited into the Bond Fund and used solely and only for
paying the principal of and interest on or Maturity Amount of the Bonds or be used to reimburse a fund or
account from which advances to the Bond Fund may have been made to pay principal of or interest on or
Maturity Amount of the Bonds prior to receipt of Pledged Taxes. Interest income or investment profit
earned in the Bond Fund shall be retained in the Bond Fund for payment of the principal of and interest
on Current Interest Bonds and Variable Rate Bonds and Maturity Amount of Capital Appreciation Bonds
on the interest payment date next after such interest or profit is received or, to the extent lawful and as
determined by the Chief Financial Officer, transferred to such other funds as may be determined. On or
after such date as may be provided in a relevant Bond Order, capitalized interest, if any, deposited to and
remaining in the Bond Fund for any Variable Rate Bonds shall be transferred to such other funds or
accounts as the Chief Financial Officer shall determine or as may be provided in a relevant tax agreement
for any Tax Exempt Bonds.
B.
Project Funds Created. The amount of proceeds of the Bonds as shall be set forth in the
relevant Bond Order shall be set aside in one or more separate funds of the County, hereby created, and
designated as the “Public Safety Project Fund,” the “Health Fund Project Fund,” the “Corporate
Project Fund,” the “Capital Equipment Project Fund,” the “Insurance Reserve Fund” and the “Working
Cash Fund” (collectively, the “Project Funds”). Any Project Fund may further be divided into accounts
and designated the “Series ______ Bonds Project Account”(an “Account”). The Project Funds shall be
held and maintained as separate and segregated accounts by the Trustee. Moneys in the Project Funds
may be withdrawn or may be transferred among the Project Funds by the County to pay the costs of the
Projects upon requisition by the Chief Financial Officer or any other employee of the County designated
by the Chief Financial Officer.
Alternatively, the Chief Financial Officer may allocate the proceeds of the Bonds to one or more
related project funds or accounts of the County already in existence; provided, however, that this shall not
relieve the County and such officer of the duty to account for the proceeds as if any Project Fund or
Account were created as herein provided. The County by its Corporate Authorities reserves the right, as it
becomes necessary from time to time, to change the purposes of expenditure of any Project Fund or its
accounts, to change priorities, to revise cost allocations between expenditures and to substitute projects, in
order to meet current needs of the County; subject, however, to the provisions of the Act and to the tax
covenants of the County relating to the Tax Exempt status of interest on Tax Exempt Bonds.

used by the County to pay costs of issuance of the Bonds in accordance with normal County disbursement
procedures. Any funds remaining to the credit of the Expense Fund on the date which is six months
following the date of delivery of the Bonds shall be transferred to the County Treasurer for deposit into
such fund or account of the County as the Chief Financial Officer may direct.
E.
Investments. The moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund may be invested from time to time
by the Trustee at the written direction of the Chief Financial Officer in Qualified Investments. Any such
investments may be sold from time to time by the Trustee without further direction from the County as
moneys may be needed for the purposes for which the Bond Fund has been created. The moneys on
deposit in each Project Fund shall be invested from time to time by the Trustee at the written direction of
the Chief Financial Officer in any lawful investment for County funds. In addition, the Chief Financial
Officer shall direct the Trustee (which direction may be by telephonic or facsimile transmission by the
County to the Trustee and confirmed by facsimile transmission by the Trustee to the County) to sell such
investments when necessary to remedy any deficiency in the Bond Fund, any Project Fund or any
accounts created therein. All other investment earnings shall be attributed to the account for which the
investment was made.
F.
Deposits. All moneys (not including securities) held by the Trustee subject to the
provisions of this Section may be deposited by it, on demand or time deposit, in its banking department or
with such banks, national banking associations, trust companies, savings banks or savings and loan
associations, that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as may be designated by the
President or the Chief Financial Officer. No such moneys shall be deposited with any such financial
institution in an amount exceeding 50 percent of the amount that an officer of such financial institution
shall certify to the Trustee and the Chief Financial Officer as the combined capital and surplus of such
financial institution. No such moneys shall be deposited or remain on deposit with any such financial
institution in excess of the amount insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
unless (a) such financial institution shall have lodged with the trust department of the Trustee or with a
Federal Reserve Bank or branch or, with the written approval of the Trustee and the Chief Financial
Officer, pledged to some other financial institution for the benefit of the County and the holders of Bonds,
as collateral security for the moneys deposited, Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations having a
market value (exclusive of accrued interest) at least equal to 100 percent of the amount of such moneys,
and (b) the Trustee shall have a perfected first lien in the Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations
serving as collateral, and such Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations shall be free from all third
party liens. The Trustee shall allow and credit interest on any such moneys held by it at such rate as it
customarily allows upon similar funds of similar size and under similar conditions or as required by law.
Interest in respect of moneys or on securities in any fund shall be credited in each case to the fund in
which such moneys or securities are held.

6901

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
G.
Repurchase Agreements. The County may invest any moneys pursuant to a repurchase
agreement. Each repurchase agreement shall meet the requirements of the Public Funds Investment Act
of the State of Illinois, as amended, or be secured by Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations or such
Qualified Investments as may be specified in a relevant Bond Order, having a market value, marked to
market weekly, at least equal to 102 percent of the amount invested in the repurchase agreement plus
accrued interest. The Trustee shall at all times have a first lien in such Federal Obligations or Agency
Obligations perfected (i) by possession of certificated securities held by the Trustee or held by a third
party acting on behalf of the Trustee if the institution serving as Trustee is also the counterparty to the
repurchase agreement and is providing the collateral securities, or (ii) under the book-entry procedures
specified in 31 Code of Federal Regulations 306.1 et seq. or 31 Code of Federal Regulations 350.0 et seq.
The President or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to enter into, execute and deliver any
investment or repurchase agreement authorized by this Ordinance, and any additional documents as shall
be necessary to accomplish the purposes of any such agreement.
H.
Variable Rate Funds or Accounts. Other funds or accounts appropriate for Variable Rate
Bonds, such as a purchase fund to accommodate demands for purchase of such Bonds and the
remarketing of same to other Bond owners, may be created in the Indenture.
I.
Taxes Levied for Refunded Bonds. To the extent not theretofore abated and as determined
necessary by the Chief Financial Officer, the taxes previously levied and collected (or in the process of
collection) to pay the Refunded Bonds shall be used to effectuate the Refunding as provided in the
Escrow Agreement, or to the extent not needed due to the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, shall be
deposited into the Bond Fund and used to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds. Taxes previously
levied for the Refunded Bonds but not yet extended for collection shall be abated. The Chief Financial
Officer is hereby expressly authorized to file an abatement certificate with the County Clerk, without
further official action of the Corporate Authorities, to effectuate such abatement.
Sec. 13.

General Tax Covenants.

A.
Not Private Activity Bonds. None of the Tax Exempt Bonds is a “private activity bond”
as defined in Section 141(a) of the Code. In support of such conclusion, the County certifies, represents
and covenants as follows:
1.

No more than the portion allowable for Tax Exempt financings of the sale proceeds of
each Series of Tax Exempt Bonds, each considered separately, plus investment earnings
thereon, will be used, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any Private Business
Use.

2.

The payment of more than the portion allowable for Tax Exempt financings of the
principal of or the interest on each Series of the Tax Exempt Bonds, each considered
separately, will not be, directly or indirectly (i) secured by any interest in (A) property
used or to be used in any Private Business Use or (B) payments in respect of such
property or (ii) on a present value basis, derived from payments in respect of property, or
borrowed money, used or to be used in any activity carried on by any person other than a
state or local governmental unit.

3.

No more than the lesser of five percent of the sale proceeds of each Series of the Tax
Exempt Bonds and investment earnings thereon or $5,000,000 will be used, directly or
indirectly, to make or finance loans to any persons.

6902

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
4.

No user of any portion of the Public Safety Fund Project, the Health Fund Project, the
Corporate Fund Project, or the Capital Equipment Project financed by Tax Exempt Bonds
(collectively, the “Infrastructure”) other than a state or local governmental unit will use
more than the portion of the Infrastructure, in the aggregate, which is allowable for Tax
Exempt Financings, on any basis other than the same basis as the general public; and no
person other than a state or local governmental unit will be a user of more than such
allowable portion of the Infrastructure, in the aggregate, as a result of (i) ownership, (ii)
actual or beneficial use pursuant to a lease or a management, service, incentive payment,
research or output contract, or (iii) any other similar arrangement, agreement or
understanding, whether written or oral.

5.

The County has not and will not enter into any arrangement that conveys to any person,
other than a state or local government unit, special legal entitlements to any portion of the
Infrastructure that is available for use by the general public. No person, other than a state
or local governmental unit, is receiving or will receive any special economic benefit from
use of any portion of the Infrastructure that is not available for use by the general public.

B.
Pertaining to Rebate. The County further certifies and covenants as follows with respect
to the requirements of Section 148(f) of the Code, relating to the rebate of “excess arbitrage profits” (the
“Rebate , the County Requirement”) to the United States:
1.

Unless an applicable exception to the Rebate Requirement is available to the County will
meet the Rebate Requirement.

2.

Relating to applicable exceptions, any Designated Officer is hereby authorized to make
such elections under the Code as either such officer shall deem reasonable and in the best
interests of the County. If such election may result in a “penalty in lieu of rebate” as
provided in the Code, and such penalty is incurred (the “Penalty”), then the County shall
pay such Penalty.

3.

The Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be
established, at such time and in such manner as they may deem necessary or appropriate
hereunder, a “200__ General Obligation Bonds Rebate [or Penalty, if applicable] Fund”
(the “148 Compliance Fund”) for the Tax Exempt Bonds, and such officers shall further,
not less frequently than annually, cause to be transferred to the 148 Compliance Fund the
amount determined to be the accrued liability under the Rebate Requirement or Penalty.
Said Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be paid
to the U.S., without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time
to time as required, amounts sufficient to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the
Penalty.

4.

Interest earnings in the Bond Fund and any Project Fund are hereby authorized to be
transferred, without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time
to time as required, to the 148 Compliance Fund for the purposes herein provided; and
proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds and other lawfully available funds of the County are
also hereby authorized to be used to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the Penalty,
but only if necessary after application of investment earnings as aforesaid.

6903

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
Sec. 14.

Registered Form.

The County recognizes that Section 149 of the Code requires Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued and
to remain in fully registered form in order to be and remain Tax Exempt. In this connection, the County
agrees that it will not take any action to permit Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued in, or converted into,
bearer or coupon form.
Sec. 15.

Further Tax-Exemption Covenants.

The County agrees to comply with all provisions of the Code which, if not complied with by the
County, would cause Tax Exempt Bonds not to be Tax Exempt. In furtherance of the foregoing
provisions, but without limiting their generality, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such
further specific covenants, representations as shall be truthful, and assurances as may be necessary or
advisable; (b) to comply with all representations, covenants and assurances contained in certificates or
agreements as may be prepared by Bond Counsel; (c) to consult with Bond Counsel and to comply with
such advice as may be given; (d) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may be
required and in a timely manner; and (e) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ and
pay fiscal agents, Financial Advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such
compliance.
The County also certifies and further covenants with the Underwriters and registered owners of
the Tax Exempt Bonds from time to time outstanding that moneys on deposit in any fund or account in
connection with the Tax Exempt Bonds, whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of
the sale of the Tax Exempt Bonds or from any other source, will not be used in a manner which will cause
the Tax Exempt Bonds to be “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Code Section 148 and any lawful
regulations promulgated thereunder, as the same presently exist or may from time to time hereafter be
amended, supplemented or revised.
The County further covenants that it will not take any action, or omit to take any action or permit
the taking or omission of any action within its control (including, without limitation, making or permitting
any use of the proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds) if taking, permitting or omitting to take such action
would cause any Tax Exempt Bond to be a private activity bond within the meaning of the Code or would
otherwise cause interest on the Tax Exempt Bonds to be included in the gross income of the recipients
thereof for federal income tax purposes. The County acknowledges that, in the event of an examination

Sec. 17.

Opinion of Counsel Exception.

The County reserves the right to use or invest moneys in connection with the Bonds in any
manner, notwithstanding the tax-related covenants set forth in Sections 13 through 16 herein, provided,
that it shall first have received an opinion from Bond Counsel to the effect that such use or investment as
contemplated is valid and proper under applicable law and this Ordinance and that such use or investment
will not adversely affect the Tax Exempt status of the Tax Exempt Bonds.
Sec. 18.

Certain Rights Reserved to County.

The County reserves the rights as follows:
A.
The County reserves the right to provide one or more Credit Facilities, or a combination
thereof to secure the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on one or more Series of
Outstanding Bonds, or in the event owners of such Bonds have the right to require purchase thereof, to
secure the payment of the purchase price of such Bonds upon the demand of the owners thereof. In
connection with any such Credit Facilities, the County may execute and deliver an agreement setting forth
the conditions upon which drawings or advances may be made under such Credit Facilities and the
method by which the County will reimburse the issuer of such Credit Facilities for such drawings together
with interest thereon at such rate or rates and otherwise make payments as may be agreed upon by the
County and the issuer of such Credit Facilities. Any such obligation of the County to reimburse or
otherwise make payments to the issuer of such Credit Facilities securing a Series of Outstanding Bonds
shall constitute operating expenses of the County payable, from any moneys, revenues, receipts, income,
assets or funds of the County available for such purpose or be payable from the Pledged Taxes, as the
Chief Financial Officer may from time to time determine, under this Ordinance to the same extent as any
Series of Outstanding Bonds, and any and all amounts payable by the County to reimburse the issuer of
any such Credit Facilities, together with interest thereon, shall for purposes of this Ordinance be deemed
to constitute the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Outstanding Bonds. Such
amounts shall not constitute an indebtedness of the County for which its full faith and credit is pledged.
B.
(1) If the County shall enter into a Qualified Swap Agreement with a Swap Provider
requiring the County to pay fixed interest rate on a notional amount, or requiring the County to pay a
variable interest rate on a notional amount, and the County has made a determination that such Qualified
Swap Agreement was entered into for the purpose of providing substitute interest payments for
Outstanding Bonds of a particular maturity or maturities in a principal amount equal to the notional
amount of the Qualified Swap Agreement and so long as the Swap Provider under such Qualified Swap
Agreement is not in default under such Qualified Swap Agreement:
(a)

for purposes of any calculation of the principal of and interest of, or Maturity
Amount of, such Outstanding Bonds, the interest rate on the related Bonds of
such maturity or maturities shall be determined as if such Bonds bore interest at
the fixed interest rate or the variable interest rate, as the case may be, payable by
the County under such Qualified Swap Agreement;

(b)

any net payments required to be made by the County to the Swap Provider
pursuant to such Qualified Swap Agreement from Pledged Taxes shall be made
on a parity with payments due on other Outstanding Bonds from amounts on
deposit to the credit of the Bond Fund; and

6905

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
(c)

(2)

any net payments received by the County from the Swap Provider pursuant to
such Qualified Swap Agreement shall, so long as there is no deficiency in any
account requirement, be applied as directed by the Chief Financial Officer.

If the County shall enter into a swap agreement of the type generally described in
paragraph (B)(1) above that does not satisfy the requirements for qualification as a
Qualified Swap Agreement as a result of its failure to make the determination described
therein or otherwise, then:
(a)

the interest rate adjustment or assumptions referred to in paragraph (a) of said
subsection (B)(1) shall not be made;

(b)

any net payments required to be made by the County to the Swap Provider
pursuant to such swap agreement shall be made from any moneys, revenues,
receipts, income, assets or funds of the County available for such purpose or be
payable from the Pledged Taxes, as the Chief Financial Officer may from time to
time determine; and

(c)

any net payments received by the County from the Swap Provider pursuant to
such swap agreement may be treated as Pledged Taxes at the option of the
County and applied as directed by the Chief Financial Officer.

C.
With respect to any Series of Outstanding Bonds, the County may provide for a
subaccount of the Bond Fund securing solely such Series, and such Series shall then have no claim on any
other cash or assets in or of the Bond Fund.
Sec. 19.

Indentures.

Any Indenture for Variable Rate Bonds shall conform as fully as may be practicable to the
provisions of Sections 20 to 46, inclusive, hereof, but need not be identical, giving effect to the unique
features of such Bonds. In addition, the provisions of this Ordinance relating to the following matters are
subject to different provisions that may be contained in an Indenture for Variable Rate Bonds:

Sec. 20.

(a)

the definition of, and rights and remedies related to, Events of Default;

discharged, payment provided for, and the County’s liability terminated as follows:

6906

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
(a)
Discharge of Indebtedness. If (i) the County shall pay or cause to be paid to the
registered owners of the Bonds the principal, premium, if any, and interest, in the case of Current Interest
Bonds, and the Maturity Amount, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, to become due thereon at the
times and in the manner stipulated therein and herein, (ii) all fees and expenses of the Trustee shall have
been paid, and (iii) the County shall keep, perform and observe all and singular the covenants and
promises in the Bonds and in this Ordinance expressed as to be kept, performed and observed by it or on
its part, then these presents and the rights hereby granted shall cease, determine and be void. If the
County shall pay or cause to be paid to the registered owners of all Outstanding Bonds of a particular
Series, or of a particular maturity within a Series, the principal, premium, if any, and interest, in the case
of Current Interest Bonds, and the Maturity Amount, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, to
become due thereon at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and herein, such Bonds shall cease
to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under the Ordinance, and all covenants, agreements and
obligations of the County to the holders of such Bonds shall thereupon cease, terminate and become void
and discharged and satisfied.
(b)
Provision for Payment. Bonds for the payment or redemption or prepayment of which
sufficient monies or sufficient Defeasance Obligations shall have been deposited with the Trustee or an
escrow agent having fiduciary capacity (whether upon or prior to the maturity or the redemption date of
such Bonds) shall be deemed to be paid within the meaning of this Ordinance and no longer outstanding
under this Ordinance; provided, however, that if such Bonds are to be redeemed prior to the maturity
thereof, notice of such redemption shall have been duly given as provided in this Ordinance or
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for the giving thereof. Defeasance
Obligations shall be considered sufficient only if said investments mature and bear interest in such
amounts and at such times as will assure sufficient cash to pay currently maturing interest, principal or
Maturity Amount, as applicable, and redemption premiums if any when due on the Bonds without
rendering the interest on any Bonds taxable under the Code.
The County may at any time surrender to the Trustee for cancellation by it any Bonds previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder, which the County may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,
and such Bonds, upon such surrender and cancellation, shall be deemed to be paid and retired.
(c)
Termination of County’s Liability. Upon the discharge of indebtedness under paragraph
(a) hereof, or upon the deposit with the Trustee of sufficient money and Defeasance Obligations (such
sufficiency being determined as provided in paragraph (b) hereof) for the retirement of any particular
Bond or Bonds, all liability of the County in respect of such Bond or Bonds shall cease, determine and be
completely discharged and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment out of the
money and the proceeds of the Defeasance Obligations deposited with aforesaid for their payment.

according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any
discrimination or preference;

6913

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
(B)
second, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal or then

have become due (other than Bonds matured or called for redemption for the payment of which monies
are held pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance), in the order of their due dates, with interest upon
such Outstanding Current Interest Bonds from the respective dates upon which they became due, and, if
the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full Outstanding Bonds due on any particular date,

any such funds, so long as the Trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the
circumstances, and ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Ordinance as
may be applicable at the time of application by the Trustee. Whenever the Trustee shall apply such funds,
it shall fix the date (which shall be an interest payment date unless the Trustee shall deem another date
more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of
principal paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The Trustee shall give such notice as it may deem
appropriate of the fixing of any such date and of the endorsement to be entered on each Bond on which
payment shall be made, and shall not be required to make payment to the holder of any unpaid Bond until
such Bond shall be presented to the Trustee for appropriate endorsement, or some other procedure
deemed satisfactory by the Trustee.

ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 25, 2008 from
RUPERT F. GRAHAM, JR., P.E., Superintendent of Highways
Re:

Floodplain Ordinance Amendment

The Department requests your approval of the following Floodplain Ordinance Amendment. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recently completed revisions to the countywide Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Cook County, Illinois and Incorporated
Areas. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources has informed us that to meet the requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Program, Cook County will need to amend Chapter 106, Section 106-5 (3) of
the Cook County Code. Previously, Ordinance Amendment 08-O-31 was approved by the County Board
on April 23, 2008 to reflect the new FIRM effective date of August 19, 2008. This FIS is codicil of the
FIRM and also needs to have the correct effective date of August 19, 2008 according to 44 C.F.R.

JUVENILE PROBATION AND COURT SERVICES DEPARTMENT
GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 26, 2008 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $750,000.00 from the Illinois
Department of Human Services under the Redeploy Illinois initiative. Redeploy Illinois is a state-wide
initiative that targets high-risk juvenile offenders who face incarceration because they are no longer
eligible for detention alternative programs. The program helps divert this population by funding
expansion of community-based sanctions and treatment alternatives. In Cook County, the grant would
fund the diversion of 30 minors from detention to residential treatment programs which are under the
supervision of the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department’s Intensive Probation Supervision
(IPS) unit. Funds would be used exclusively for treatment services.
This grant does not require a cash match. Also, continued funding has been pledged for an additional two
years, at $750,000.00 per annum, contingent on program success.
The authorization to accept the original grant was given on December 18, 2007 by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners in the amount of $373,000.00.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $750,000.00. Funding period: July 1, 2008 through June
30, 2009.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents, and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the request of the Chief
Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

Services Inc. (YOS), Chicago, Illinois, to provide services to the court’s second year “Redeploy Illinois”
program, which is part of the state-wide grant initiative to divert high risk juvenile offenders who would
otherwise face incarceration to community-based sanctions and treatment alternatives.
Reason:

It is requested that Youth Outreach Services, Inc. (YOS) be designated as a sole provider for
this contract due to their proven track record in providing an extensive array of services to
minor wards of the court under grant-funded Contract No. 06-41-746. Further, YOS is
integral to the project working with the court to recruit and train families in the application of
the foster care program for at-risk minors. The grant was awarded on the basis of YOS
involvement.

Re:

Shield Complex, LLC Assumption request
Christian Vision Center, Inc. Project No. 07184300076

transmitted herewith is the recommended proposal for the assumption of the HOME Investment
Partnership (HOME) Program loan of Christian Vision Center, Inc. by Shields Complex, LLC. Under the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) HOME Program, in 2002, Cook
County committed HOME program funds in the amount of $1,179,796.00 for the construction of lowincome housing to serve the needs of formerly homeless individuals and families moving from
transitional housing within Chicago Heights and the surrounding south suburban communities into what
is known as “Woodson Complex” in Chicago Heights. The use of the funds was incorporated into the
County’s Annual Actual Plan to HUD.

6961

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 22, 2008
The 16 unit, four (4) two-stories, project complied with the Cook County’s Consolidated Plan by
providing decent affordable housing within a suitable living environment and supported the development
of affordable permanent supportive housing for formerly homeless persons.
Christian Vision Center, Inc. is now defunct and Shields Complex, LLC, 100% member owned by
Community and Economic Development Association of Cook County, Inc. (CEDA) desires to assume the
loan and the property management of Christian Vision Center, Inc.
Assumption of the loan will prevent foreclosure by the first lien holder, Illinois Housing Development
Authority (IHDA), allows Cook County to remain in compliance with the twenty year HUD affordability
period, and meet our commitment entailed in the Cook County’s Consolidated Community Development
Plan to ensure decent and affordable rental housing to low and moderate income persons.
I respectfully request approval of the recommended assumption of Christian Vision Center, Inc. loan by
Shields Complex, LLC and I, or the Bureau Chief, Capital, Planning and Facilities Management, or his
designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to
further the program approved herein, including, but not limited to, notes, mortgages, agreements, letters,

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 27, 2008 from
RAYMOND MULDOON, Director, Real Estate Management Division
requesting approval of the lease termination agreement between the County of Cook, as Landlord, and the
Cook County Sheriff, (“Tenant”) for office space used by the Child Support Division in the George West
W. Dunne Cook County Office Building located at 69 West Washington, Chicago, Illinois. The Dunne
Building Lease was renewed in 2006 for a five year term expiring June 30, 2011.
The Sheriff has determined that due to changes in operations, the function carried on in the Premises can
be more efficiently performed in a smaller space in a location outside of the central business district.
In the interest of increasing efficiency in the performance of governmental services and reducing
administrative costs, and in the spirit of intergovernmental cooperation, the Sheriff has requested that the
County terminate the Dunne Building Lease early.
Tenant has identified space at the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center currently occupied by another
Sheriff’s function, which can be converted to the use of the Child Support Division.
The relocation of Child Support Division provides for a centralized location for roll calls, easy access for
summon and warrant retrievals, and increased efficiency with the process of service and execution of
child support warrants. The new office space will reduce square footage to approximately 1,134 sq ft
from 6,392.
Approval recommended.
