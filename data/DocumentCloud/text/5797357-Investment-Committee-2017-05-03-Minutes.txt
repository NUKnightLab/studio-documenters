Assistant Executive Director’s Report
Assistant Executive Director, David Cetlinski, discussed the following with The Board:
�
�

IT employee Mike Powning’s last day in Retirement Systems will be Friday May
5th, 2017 after twenty-two years with the System.
2016 Funding Reports will be available by the end of May.

~AED report concludes~
Statement from Trustee Cowan:
Trustee Cowan feels that it is highly unacceptable for the investment staff to schedule
the Due Diligence seminar/meeting during Board meeting days and with such short
notice to the Board of Trustees. She feels that all of the Trustees should have been free
to go if they so choose to do so.
