Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
CCHHS FY2015 Turnover by New Hires;
FY2015 HR Goal: Improve/Reduce Average Time to Hire;
Physician Classifications in Process; and
Comparison of Separations.
Ms. Lopez noted that the report indicates that the year-end vacancies filled total 1,266; the total is actually 1,267.
She stated that she met with Chairman Wiese last week; they are still working on what the FY2016 goals will be
for Human Resources; having the data and being able to close the fiscal year will allow for the opportunity to look
into the data and make some recommendations, with a focus on Ambulatory. She added that she plans to meet
with Ms. Carey to talk about her initiatives for Ambulatory Services, so that the Department of Human Resources
can help with those.
Board Chairman Hammock stated that he would like to meet with Ms. Lopez in the near future to better
understand the numbers regarding vacancies in greater detail. He inquired regarding the kinds of positions that
fall into the Job Function category of “Other,” as referenced on slide 2. Ms. Lopez stated that the category
includes positions from areas such as environmental services, food services and other administrative areas that are
not represented in the other categories listed. Board Chairman Hammock referenced a previous request made for
detail on vacancies by category. Ms. Lopez responded that she will provide that information.
Dr. Shannon commented on the significant number of 216 new nurse hires into the organization in FY2015, as
referenced on slide 6. That is a signal achievement that has strategic importance. This hiring effort required a
gigantic lift by both the Human Resources Department and the nursing management team; they did a significant
amount of interviewing and work related to simply sifting through all of the resumes. This is going to be
something that will pay off for the organization very quickly, because the energy, innovation and ideas that many
new nurse hires are going to have can really be a tonic for the organization. Director Velasquez inquired
regarding the age range of the newly hired nurses. Ms. Lopez stated that she can provide that information.
