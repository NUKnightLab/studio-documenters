PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 20, 2000 from
JAM ES M. HOULIHAN, County Assessor
I request permission to have the submitted ordinance, re lating to the Cook County Real Property
Assessment C lass ification Ord inance, placed on the agenda for consideration by the Cook County Board
of Commissioners at the meeting scheduled for Thursday , January 20, 2000. I am also requesting that the
proposal be referred to the Finance Committee for further discussion.
In December, the Board of Commissioners acted positively on my request to extend and modify property
tax incentives that were scheduled to sunset at the end of the year. These proposals were essential to
continue o ur efforts to promote economic development and I appreciate the confidence shown by the
Board in approving them.
I am now presenting further recommendations to you that are intended to increase economic development
and hous ing opportunities in Cook County. I believe that these actions must be taken to eventually ease
the increasing burden upon Cook County res idential property taxpayers a nd create a more receptive
c limate for bus iness and industry.
The ordinance changes are in response to recommendations s ubmitted a year ago by the Tax Pol icy
Fo rum, a group of nearly 300 people representing a broad spectrum of Cook County.
It is my hope that after public hearings and carefu l consideration of these proposa ls, the Board of
Commissioners approve these cha nges and take the initial necessary steps to prov ide a more eq uitable
classification and property tax structure in Cook County.
I appreciate your thorough review and positive consideration of these recommendations.

, 2000) is hereby amended to read as follows:
The Cook County Board of Commissioners finds and declares:
(I)

that in certain areas of Cook County there is a lack of viable industrial and commercial buildings,
which is contributing to substantial unemployment in such areas;

(2)

that if existing industrial and commercial structures were improved and utilized fully, and if new
industrial and commercial structures were developed, the County's economic well-being would be
improved by an increase in the level of economic activity, by increased employment opportunities
and by a growth in the real property tax base;

(3)

that because of the blighted or depressed condition of the areas where s uch development is
needed, the ordinary unaided operation of private enterprise cannot accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation and development, therefore provisions must be made for public
assistance and encouragement of such private enterprises;

( 4)

that the creation of new property tax classifications for (a) new development of industrial
structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing industrial structures, for
the County as a whole as well as for specific areas of special need, and (b) new development of
commercial structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing commercial
structures in areas that are depressed, blighted or threatened with blight, is an appropriate and
necessary method of providing such assistance and encouragement, and will result in increasing
the tax base in such areas and for the entire County; and

(5)

that the creation of a new property tax classification for the rehabilitation and new construction of
certain multifamily rental hous ing will increase and improve the stock of decent, safe and
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households in Cook County, and will remove
the blight or potential blight of deteriorating housing stock while also increasing the tax base of
the County.

(6)

that the amendment of real estate assessment classifications for the purpose of lowering the
assessment level for certain retention and development of the most affordable permanent housing
available to homeless and very low income individuals.

(7)

that the creation of a new property tax classification, to facilitate commercial and industrial
development through remediation of property, contamination of which is not attributable to the
owner, is an appropriate and necessary method of providing assistance and encouragement to
achieve remediation and utilization of such property, which will result in increasing employment
opportunities as well as the tax base in the areas in which such sites are located and in the entire
County.

(8)

that the creation of a new property tax classification, to encourage the preservation and
rehabilitation of historically and architecturally s ignificant commercial and industrial buildings,
will enhance the general character of real estate in the County and contribute to the economic
well-being of the County by increasing the level of economic activity, increasing employment
opportunities and contributing to the long-term growth of the real property tax base.

Class 4:

Real estate owned and used by a not-for-profit corporation in furtherance of the purposes
set forth in its charter unless used for residential purposes. If such real estate is used for
residential purposes, it shall be classified in the appropriate residential class.

Class 5:

All real estate not included in Class I, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4, Class 6b, Class C, Class
7a, Class 7b, Class 8, Class 9, or Class L of this section.

Class 6b:

Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, as defined herein, consisting of all
newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are
situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or
horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the
incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation
bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County ifthe real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary
for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the
Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed at the time of
filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment eornplaiRt ~ is filed to request the
class change to C lass 6b. If the resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility

421

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2000
application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or
the County, as the case may be, confirming that a resolution or ordinance supporting the
incentive has been requested.
A copy of the resolution or letter confirming that a resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor' s Office to the
secretary of the Cook County Board for distribution to the Commissioners from the
affected districts.
ln the case of abandoned property , if the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, as
the case may be, finds that special circumstances justify finding that the property is
"abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b, even though it has been vacant and unused for less
than 24 months, that finding, along with the specification of the circumstances, shall be
included in the resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application. Such resolution or ordinance shall be filed with the eligibility application. If
the ordinance or resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County is required to validate such shortened period of
qualifying abandonment, and a resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class
6b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
This classification shall continue for a period of twelve years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of
substantial reoccupancy. This incentive may be renewed during the last year a property
is entitled to a 16% assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
I.

the taxpayer notifies the Assessor' s Office of his intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook County if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, and;

2.

the municipality in which the real estate is located or the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a
resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial
to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b and;

3. a copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16% assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class 6b. Any property which applies for Class 6b treatment on or before
the adoption date of this ordinance change will be eligible for this renewal term at the end
of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements
If, at the time this ordiRam:e is adopted on the effective date of this Ordinance, a property
is receiving Class 6b treatment, but the assessment level is higher than 16%, that taxpayer
may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16% assessment level for the
prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the resolution and renewal
application. However, if at the time this ordiRaRee is adopted, as of that effective date,
the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of

422

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2000
the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on
renewal of the incentive will be granted.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Cook County Board for
distribution to Commissioners from the effected districts.
If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years,
pursuant to Section 3 below. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate
shall revert to the applicable classification under this Ordinance.
Additionally, for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures to qualify for Class 6b classification, an eligibility application must be made to
the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new construction or
substantial rehabilitation. With respect to abandoned property, the eligibility application
must be made to the Assessor no later than ninety days after purchase for value if such
property is encompassed within the definition herein of abandoned property by reason of
purchase for value; or within one year prior to the commencement of substantial
rehabilitation if such property is encompassed within that definition by reason of
substantial rehabilitation.
The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class
6b.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class 6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at
the Class 6b site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the
time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the non-filing.
Class C:

Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section lB( I I) including the land upon which such
property is situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has
undergone environmental testing and remediation and has received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" from the Site Remediation Program, as defined above.
To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the
industrial or commercial use.
The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having

Section 4.
(A)

To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the
project be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(I)

the area is, or has been within the last I 0 years, designated by federal, state or local
agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a
rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal
Consolidation Act of 1961 , as amended, or the Commercial Renewal Re-development
Areas Act of I 967, as amended, or that the area is located in a federal Empowerment
Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the
Commercial District Development Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or
designation(s) of like effect adopted under any similar statute or ordinance; and

(2)

real estate taxes within said area, during the last six years, have declined, remained
stagnant or potential real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed
condition of the area; and

(3)

there is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation
of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably
timely basis if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the
economic enhancement of the area; and

( 4)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will
materially assist development, re-development or rehabilitation of the area and the
commercial development project would not go forward without the full incentive offered
under Class 7a or 7b; and

(5)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities within the area.

Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain
from the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly

or resolution shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the time of filing the

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2000
application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted,
will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the secretary of the Board of Commissioners for
distribution to the Commissioners from the affected districts. The application shall include any
other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
commercial development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the
expense of doing so.
Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of
Cook County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the
expense of such applications, the Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of factors (1)
through (5) for Class 7a applications.
The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application
and supporting data.
Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient
size if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. ln determining what constitutes the "full incentive
offered" as provided in factor (4) above, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of future profits with the
appropriate taxing districts.
For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor find s that factors (I) through (5) exist, he shall,
within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data, ce11ify the
commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Ordinance
In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee
of Cook County. The Committee shall within thirty days return the application to the Assessor
with a finding stating whether factors (I) through (5) are present. Upon receipt of a written
request from the Committee no later than seven days prior to the expiration of the thirty day
period, the Assessor may extend for a period not to exceed an additional thirty days the time for
return of the application with the Committee's finding. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds
factors (I) through (5) exist, he shall , within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee' s findings,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this Ordinance.
Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new
construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of
the commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(B)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8
classification it is necessary: (1) that the municipality in which the area is located or, if an
unincorporated area, the County determine by lawful resolution that the area is in a state of
economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish
the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public
assistance and encouragement, or a detennination of similar import; (2) that the municipality or,
if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the area as one
in need of substantial revitalization; (3) that, upon receiving an application to certify an area as in
need of substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and
other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the severity of the economic conditions of

434

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 20, 2000
the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial revitalization" requirement is met,
the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to the fact that an area is
located in a federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by
the Cook County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May
18, 1994.
Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this Ordinance, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area.
In making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the
specific area for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the
City of Chicago shall be the "community area" as defined herein; for all other areas in the County
it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.
If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18,
1994, determines by municipal resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and
that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8
certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this ordinance. However, each
property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file their application in a
timely manner.

Section 5.
Where a single parcel of real estate is partially included in two or more of the above-described classes,
each portion shall be assessed at the assessment level herein prescribed for that class.
Section 6.
All portions of this Ordinance are severable, and if any of its prov1s1ons or any sentence, clause or
paragraph shall be held unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court
shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions.
Section 7.
A written report on the status and progress of the implementation of this Ordinance, or any amendments
thereto, and all rules promulgated by the Assessor hereunder, shall be submitted by the Cook County
Assessor to the President and Board of Cook County Commissioners annually on or before December I.

The incentive provisions of this Ordinance provided to qualifying parcels of real estate for Class 6b, Class
C, Class 7a, Class 7b and Class 8 shall expire on December 31, 2004, unless otherwise reviewed by
action of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. Real estate granted a Class 6, Class 6a, Class 6b,

terms and conditions of the Ordinance prior to January 1, 1995. Real estate for which an application for
