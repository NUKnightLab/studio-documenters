 NEXT STEPS
NOACA will develop and support key initiatives in
partnership with other organizations to advance safe
projects and to encourage safer traveler behavior.
Agencies within the NOACA region are encouraged to
assist the Ohio Traffic Safety Office with maximizing
impact of statewide message campaigns by crosspromoting these messages at the community level.

5 - 21

 NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional
cohesion, PRESERVE existing
infrastructure, and BUILD a
sustainable multimodal transportation
system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality
of life in Northeast Ohio.
