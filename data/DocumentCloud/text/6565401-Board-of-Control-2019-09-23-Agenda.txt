Purpose:
The Midwest Partners are Federal, State, and Local staff in the Midwest geographical region which includes Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. These partners are committed to improving the administration
of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and focuses on activities which improve and sustain timely
and accurate benefit approvals, reduce procedural errors, and build regional and national partnerships by sharing
successful strategies and best practices. As we implement program changes to meet the demand for nutritional
assistance, the upcoming Midwest Partners event will provide valuable tools to help agencies manage workload.
With ongoing budget challenges, it is essential that State and Local agencies use technology and other management
tools to continue high benefit accuracy and excellent service. This Midwest Partners event is timely in that the
workshops will help agencies provide a forum to recognize the excellent work currently happening in the Midwest
and to share best practices.

system for the Juvenile Justice Center parking lot. The approval will result in a not-to-exceed purchase

issues.
