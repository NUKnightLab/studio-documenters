Dear Honorable City Council,

On behalf of the North Rosedale Park Civic Association
(NRPCA), I am writing to request the City Council adopt a
resolution recognizing NRPCA as a nonpro?t corporation
operating in the City in order to allow NRPCA to obtain a
Charitable Gaming License.

We are requesting the resolution for the purpose of holding a
Millionaire Party (the Event) as a fundraiser for the NRPCA.
The Event will be held at our Community House at 18445
Scarsdale on the evening of February 29, 2020 where the
Council held a Council Meeting last. The ?mds collected
would be used to liurther renovate and repair our Community
House. The games of chance we expect to have at the Event
will be poker, black jack, and roulette.

NPRCA has been a 501c3 Charitable non-pro?t since
February 10, 2012 and before that was a 501 c4 non?pro?t
from its incorporation in 1932. In support of this application I
have also submitted with this letter copies of:

I Form of the resolution we have received from the
Michigan Gaming Control Board.

a Our Restated Articles of Incorporation effective as of
May 25, 2011 which sets forth our nonpro?t purpose
in Article and

I A copy of our most recent Annual Report ?led in
2018.

Since we have been awarded approximately 3 Community
Block Grants over the past 5 or 6 years, I am hopeful that
there is no question regarding our quali?cations to be granted
our request. However, if anyone has any questions, please
contact me at williamfre 1 a mail.com or 313-402-0725.
