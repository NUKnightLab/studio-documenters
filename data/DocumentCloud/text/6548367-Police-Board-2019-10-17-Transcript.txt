19· · · · · · · · ·In the early morning of December
20· ·26th, 2015, Officer Robert Rialmo shot and
21· ·killed Bettie Jones in her home at 4017 West
22· ·Erie Street in Chicago.
23· · · · · · · · ·Officer Rialmo did not intend to
24· ·kill Ms. Jones, and Ms. Jones did nothing to

·1· ·warrant her fate.· Instead, Ms. Jones was shot
·2· ·with a bullet intended for Mrs. Jones' upstairs
·3· ·neighbor, Quintonio LeGrier, who had threatened
·4· ·Officer Rialmo with a baseball bat.
·5· · · · · · · · ·Ms. Jones was present in the
·6· ·scene, and in close proximity to Mr. LeGrier
·7· ·as he was shot, only because she had assisted
·8· ·officers as they responded to a domestic
·9· ·disturbance occurring in the upstairs apartment
10· ·in the two-flat building in which she lived.
11· · · · · · · · ·This tragic case raises difficult
12· ·but important questions about when a police
13· ·officer may use deadly force, specifically in
14· ·this instance in which he knew or reasonably
15· ·should have known that an innocent bystander
16· ·was in his line of fire.
17· · · · · · · · ·As explained in more detail in
18· ·the decision, the Police Board finds that the
19· ·Chicago Police Department's general orders
20· ·require an officer to consider the presence of
21· ·an innocent bystander when deciding whether to
22· ·use deadly force.
23· · · · · · · · ·This finding recognizes that an
24· ·officer has a duty first and foremost to

·1· ·protect the public, and that the most critical
·2· ·mission of the Chicago Police Department is to
·3· ·prevent the loss of innocent life.
·4· · · · · · · · ·With those basic principles in
·5· ·mind, and upon examination of the facts of this
·6· ·case, the Board finds that when Officer Rialmo
·7· ·fired his gun into the direction of Bettie
·8· ·Jones, he had the ability to safety reposition
·9· ·himself even farther than he already had from
10· ·Mr. LeGrier.· Had Officer Rialmo done so, he
11· ·could have neutralized the threat posed by
12· ·Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie Jones would be
13· ·alive today.
14· · · · · · · · ·Officer Rialmo had an obligation
15· ·to reexamine his options in light of the
16· ·presence of Ms. Jones and take all reasonable
17· ·precautions to avoid shooting her, as all
18· ·officers have an obligation to act in a manner
19· ·to protect innocent persons around them.
20· · · · · · · · ·To be perfectly clear, the Board
21· ·does not believe Officer Rialmo intended to
22· ·harm Bettie Jones, but his use of deadly force
23· ·was objectively unreasonable, under the
24· ·totality of the circumstances he faced,

·1· ·inconsistent with his training and violated the
·2· ·Department's general orders.
·3· · · · · · · · ·Given the loss of Mrs. Jones'
·4· ·life that ensued, the Board finds that Officer
·5· ·Rialmo must be discharged from the Chicago
·6· ·Police Department.
·7· · · · · · · · ·In addressing the question of the
·8· ·June 28th verdict in the civil case brought by
·9· ·the estate of Quintonio LeGrier, the Board
10· ·found:· It is true that a civil jury determined
11· ·that Officer Rialmo reasonably believed that it
12· ·was necessary to use deadly force against
13· ·LeGrier to prevent death or great bodily harm
14· ·to himself or his partner.· The jury's finding,
15· ·however, does not end the Board's analysis
16· ·here, as the jury was asked a question that is
17· ·distinctly different than that asked of this
18· ·Board.· Specifically, the jury in the LeGrier
19· ·civil case was only asked whether the use of
20· ·force was reasonable as to LeGrier, not Bettie
21· ·Jones, and the jury was not asked to determine
22· ·whether the force was necessary based on the
23· ·totality of the circumstances.

·9· · · ·MS. GILL:· Good evening.· What I wanted to
10· ·discuss with the consent decree training that
11· ·the officers have been taking during the
12· ·session, one of the things is talking about how
13· ·the City will provide annual training for the
14· ·Police Board members.· One of the training that
15· ·I would like to recommend, if you guys have a
16· ·recommendation, is LEMR training, and that's
17· ·Law Enforcement Medical Rescue training that
18· ·the officers have to take.· And by 2021,
19· ·January the 1st, all officers are supposed to
20· ·be qualified in the LEMR training.· So that
21· ·might be something, because it's supposed to
22· ·be -- any officer-involved incidents, they're
23· ·supposed to be able to aid prior to emergency
24· ·services coming.

·1· · · · · · · · ·Another thing with the consent
·2· ·decree training, it talks about promotion.· And
·3· ·apparently they're going to start having more
·4· ·captains now in the districts and on each
·5· ·watch.· And based on what the captain has to do
·6· ·and what he or she dealing with the community
·7· ·and law enforcement, that that should not be
·8· ·meritorious, as much as back to civil service,
·9· ·because you're dealing with all your TRRs,
10· ·you're dealing with all your reports that have
11· ·to be done, and it's not so much who you know,
12· ·who recommended you to be captain, but what you
13· ·know.· And civil services should go all the way
14· ·up at least to the commander, because you're
15· ·dealing with patrol and you're dealing with the
16· ·community.
17· · · · · · · · ·The last thing is, I know a lot
18· ·of people have issues with the officers and
19· ·everything with going on with their mental
20· ·health and what's been going on with the
21· ·suicide rate and things with the officers
22· ·around the country.
23· · · · · · · · ·One of the things the private
24· ·industry does that we don't do is a mental

·2· ·day where you have to give a reason why you're
·3· ·taking off, it's just you are calling up and
·4· ·saying, I am taking a mental health day.· No
·5· ·questions asked.· And that might be something
·6· ·that might behoove the Department, and you guys
·7· ·can consider it.
·8· · · · · · · · ·Last thing is community policing.
·9· ·A lot of new sergeants are coming in as
10· ·community policing sergeants, and they don't
11· ·really have anybody to actually guide or be a
12· ·liaison.· I know each area has a community
13· ·person.· I don't know what the official title
14· ·is, but with that, I think they need to
15· ·actually -- sorry.· Seek out the officers and
16· ·new sergeants and work with them versus having
17· ·them come out.· A lot of things going on.
18· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.· If I
19· ·ask -- so, John, I'm going to let you speak
20· ·about the first part.· John O'Malley is

·1· ·the training, as far as the promotions, is that
·2· ·something that you would like to take back to
·3· ·the monitor or would you like us to take it
·4· ·back?· How would you like to handle that as far
·5· ·as the recommendation?
·6· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· So, yeah,
·7· ·regarding the consent decree, there are some
·8· ·recommendations in there that we are looking
·9· ·at.· Because of the consent decree, there are
10· ·paragraphs in there that talk about the
11· ·promotion, the merit promotion, and things of
12· ·that nature.· So we are exploring that right
13· ·now.· And things may change.
14· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· And the mental health
15· ·day?
16· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· Of course mental
17· ·health is a priority for us right now because
18· ·we've been dealing with suicides here in
19· ·Chicago and across the country.· And mental
20· ·health is also in the consent decree, for us to
21· ·get more funding to give the officers the tools
22· ·they need.

·4· ·Thank you for allowing me to speak to you
·5· ·today.
·6· · · · · · · · ·I hate to say this, but you got
·7· ·this one wrong on Rialmo.· And there are
·8· ·consequences to getting things wrong.
·9· · · · · · · · ·The problem is that Officer
10· ·Rialmo is not a super hero.· He is not
11· ·clairvoyant.· He doesn't have the ability to
12· ·know what is going to happen.· He does know
13· ·that someone is coming at him with a baseball
14· ·bat.· He is in fear for his life and he
15· ·discharges his weapon.
16· · · · · · · · ·One of the things that was said
17· ·tonight was that Bettie Jones -- who I want to
18· ·add, that is a tragedy.· She should not have
19· ·died; however, it was said here tonight that
20· ·the police enlisted her help.· That was not
21· ·accurate.· What was enlisted in her help was
22· ·the offender's father who wanted her to open
23· ·that door.· The offender -- I will repeat that.
24· ·The offender precipitated the circumstances

·3· · · · · · · · ·If you are sending a message to
·4· ·the Chicago Police Department that when they
·5· ·are in fear of their life, the law and the
·6· ·policies that were adhered to in this case are
·7· ·not being followed, then you're telling them
·8· ·that they're on their own.
·9· · · · · · · · ·You need to back up the police
10· ·officers for doing their job.· What happened
11· ·here happened in so many cases where the
12· ·offender has failed to obey the lawful commands
13· ·of the police officer.· And that's what we're
14· ·talking about today.· And you're sending a
15· ·terrible message to the Chicago police
16· ·officers, the men and woman who protect this
17· ·City, and you are not backing them up.· Thank

·2· ·three, that he brought discredit upon the
·3· ·entire Chicago Police Department.· And all of
·4· ·this is contained in log number 1066452.
·5· · · · · · · · ·Now, we came here last month and
·6· ·Superintendent Eddie Johnson told us that he
·7· ·had not heard about this case before.
·8· · · · · · · · ·Well, now a month has passed, so
·9· ·we've come here again to ask what is the status
10· ·of this case?· Who is it before?· And in case
11· ·Superintendent Johnson doesn't have the facts,
12· ·I would appreciate it if the sergeant would
13· ·take this binder to him because this contains
14· ·all of the depositions, all of the findings of
15· ·IPRA that have spanned years and years of
16· ·investigation.· So if you don't have the facts,
17· ·I'm happy to provide them for you today.
18· · · · · · · · ·The last thing that I want to say
19· ·is that six years have elapsed between Officer
20· ·Walsh attacking James Matthews and today.· For
21· ·six years we have faced a miscarriage of
22· ·justice.

·3· ·next month.
·4· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
·5· ·Superintendent?
·6· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· So right now it is
·7· ·my understanding that the status of the case is
·8· ·in arbitration.· So we still have to wait until
·9· ·that process is completed.· Once it is, we will
10· ·be able to give you an idea where the case
11· ·actually is.
12· · · ·REVEREND FRAZIER:· Do we have a timeline of
13· ·this arbitration?
14· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· I can't answer
15· ·that.
16· · · ·REVEREND FRAZIER:· Who is conducting the
17· ·arbitration?
18· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· An independent
19· ·arbitrator is handling the case.
20· · · ·REVEREND FRAZIER:· Is this being conducted
21· ·through the internal police bureau?
22· · · ·SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:· Not through us.

12· · · · · · · · ·It's pathetic.· It's disgusting.
13· ·You have sent a message to police officers

·2· · · ·MR. McMANUS:· Good evening, folks.· I am
·3· ·here to speak on the potential solution of the
·4· ·arbitration for Officer Thomas Walsh.
·5· · · · · · · · ·First of all, I'd like to thank
·6· ·you, Pastor Frazier, for bringing facts to our
·7· ·police chief; however, I do have some facts of
·8· ·my own, and this dates back to when I was
·9· ·living in a park in 2008 when I first met Tom
10· ·Walsh.· I initially approached him and his
11· ·previous commander, then District 23 Commander
12· ·Kathleen Bohmer, about potential community
13· ·relations between black LGBT youth and her
14· ·command staff.
15· · · · · · · · ·When Tommy found out I was living
16· ·in a park, he literally took whatever amount of
17· ·money out of his wallet and drove me to a motel
18· ·and paid for a motel room for a week.
19· · · · · · · · ·Now, for a white Irish cop to do
20· ·this for a black bisexual man who was living in

·3· ·officer would see me on the streets of
·4· ·Boystown, he would always speak, check on me
·5· ·and sometimes buy me food and a soda.· But most
·6· ·importantly, he would treat me like a person.
·7· ·Not just me, but all street youth, especially
·8· ·black and brown youth.· Though I'm a

12· · · · · · · · ·The officer who played an
13· ·important role in me getting my life together,
14· ·having five years of sobriety and becoming a
15· ·productive member of this society would be
16· ·Officer Thomas J. Walsh of the 19th District.
17· · · · · · · · ·I attended this meeting last
18· ·month and heard folks in here telling the Board
19· ·and Superintendent that Officer Walsh is a
20· ·racist, anger-fueled officer, and that's just
