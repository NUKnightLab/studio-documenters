Proposed Resolution sponsored by Gregg Goslin, Bridget Gainer, Elizabeth “Liz”
Doody Gorman, Timothy O. Schneider, Todd H. Stroger, President, William M.

Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
FLEET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
WHEREAS, Cook County has a fleet of approximately 2000 vehicles; and
WHEREAS, the implementation of a fleet management program using a carsharing approach to county vehicles on a cross-departmental basis could increase
the efficiency of the county fleet, offering potential cost-savings and decreasing the
environmental impact of county vehicle usage; and
WHEREAS, there is technology and equipment available to manage public sector
fleets, providing real-time data, including: vehicle demand, usage, reservations,
drivers and maintenance; and
WHEREAS, this information can be used to help maximize fleet performance and
achieve an average of 20 to 40 percent reduction in total vehicles; and
WHEREAS, the District of Columbia began a 6-month pilot program in a fleet
management program in October of 2009 with the goal of eliminating 150 vehicles
from the city’s motor fleet; and
WHEREAS, at the end of the six-month pilot program, the District reduced the
number of cars in its passenger car fleet by 360 vehicles—17% of the original
fleet—to yield an estimated savings of $6.6 million over five years; and
WHEREAS, following the pilot program, the District of Columbia continued with
their new management program, under which the District currently operates at a
ratio of 15:1 drivers to vehicles, while most counties and cities operate at driver
ratios between 2:1 and 5:1 per vehicle; and
WHEREAS, combined with the District’s fleet reduction, the new fleet management
program yields an estimated reduction of 800-900 metric tons of carbon dioxide
emissions; and
WHEREAS, fleet management technology can also provide extensive reporting
capabilities which can identify safety risks and help ensure vehicle policies are
followed by tracking the location and driver of County vehicles at all times.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners requests that the Bureau of Administration explore the use of an
electronic fleet management system to manage Cook County vehicles, where
appropriate; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Bureau of Administration report back to the
Cook County Board of Commissioners to present their findings at their earliest
possible convenience.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 01/26/10.
