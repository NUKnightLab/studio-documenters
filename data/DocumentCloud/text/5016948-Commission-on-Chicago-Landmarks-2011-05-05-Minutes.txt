 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
May 5, 2011
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on April 7, 2011, at 1:30 p.m. The meeting was held
at 33 N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Ed Torrez (arrived at 1:32pm)

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cynthia Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1618 N. Cleveland
(Old Town Triangle District - 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed installation of an 11’-0” wide curb cut on Meyer Avenue

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The 11’-width of the proposed curb cut shall be reduced to be between
8’ and 9’ in keeping within the range of the widths of the existing
single-car curb cuts on Meyer Avenue; and,
2. The parking pad shall be screened from view with a new fence and
gate. Any new fence and gate should be a solid or picket wood fence,
painted or stained, no taller than 6’ in height. Elevation and plan
drawings shall be submitted with the permit application.

2.

2127 W. Schiller
(Wicker Park District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of 2½-story masonry single-family residence and
detached masonry garage with alley access

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The design of the front porch shall be further studied and resubmitted
for Historic Preservation staff review and approval to address the

 following:
a. Roof: The roofs of historic full-width porches in the district are
typically flat or hipped with a very low pitch, which (along
with the roof’s fascia board) has the effect of minimizing the
roof’s profile, form and visibility;
b. Foundation material: Historic porches in the district typically
have open foundations screened with lattice or are enclosed
with the predominant cladding material of the façade. Porch
foundations, if solid, typically have pronounced decks and
piers, with recessed panels between the piers or other
architectural relief. Lattice could also be used in such instances
to help mask the solid recessed panels between the porch piers;
c. Railings: Metal railings for stairs and porches should typically
be more ornamental and less utilitarian in nature, in keeping
with the character of such features in the district;
2. French Doors: The Committee encouraged the applicant to consider
changing the two proposed French doors on the front elevation to
windows to be more in keeping with the character of historic buildings
in the district;
3. The applicant shall provide face brick, mortar and limestone samples
for Historic Preservation staff review and approval prior to permit
submittal. The brick and stone colors and textures shall match typical
colors and textures found within the district, and mortar shall match
the color of the face brick; and,
4. The project, as proposed, will require an administrative adjustment to
allow an 8” decrease of the required east side yard. The Commission
takes no position regarding the necessity or appropriateness of any
requested variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code
requirements.
3.

11241-43 S. St. Lawrence
(Pullman District – 9th Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: Installation of replacement windows and tuckpointing of two
row houses without a permit

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Historic photos of this block (but not with a clear view of the subject
properties) show that both two-over-one and one-over-one doublehung window configurations existed historically for this block and
specific Pullman rowhouse type. No original drawings have been
located for this block’s specific Pullman rowhouse type, and other
physical or archival evidence is inconclusive. The proposed wood
one-over-one double-hung replacement windows are therefore
approved as proposed;

 2. Any masonry cleaning shall use the gentlest means possible;
specifications and information on cleaning products and cleaning
methods shall be submitted as part of a permit application. After the
cleaning, the applicant shall notify Historic Preservation staff for a site
visit. To the extent that the tuckpointing performed without a permit
does not match in terms of joint width, profile, and mortar color,
remedial work shall be required, e.g. grinding out the mortar joints or
removing a minimum depth of ½” or until sound mortar is reached.
New mortar shall match the historic mortar in color, type, and joint
profile. The masonry shall not be sealed, as this treatment can lead to
moisture buildup within the masonry cavity wall; and,
3. The owner shall obtain permits to address the violations including a
permit for any required remedial tuckpointing work and an
environmental permit for any chemical cleaning of the façade.
