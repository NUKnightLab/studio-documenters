WHEREAS, the County of Cook (“County”) is empowered to take and have the care and custody of all

incurred by the County for licensing, permitting, inspecting, monitoring and regulating such uses of the

WHEREAS, while State and federal law limit the authority of local governments to enact laws that
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunications services, the County has the power, under
existing State and federal law, to approve appropriate regulations and restrictions relative to small cell,

placement and siting of wireless telecommunication facilities within County rights-of-way, (iii) preserve
the character of the areas in which facilities are installed, (iv) minimize any adverse visual impact of
