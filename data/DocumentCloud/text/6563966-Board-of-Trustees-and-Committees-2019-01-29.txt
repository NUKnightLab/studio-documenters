RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
This is a month to be #METROProud. This is a new hashtag brought to us by one of our own,
Melissa Barna. There is a new feeling in the air. Every department has a new energy, a new
boost to their morale, a new team feeling. It’s contagious. Old and new are becoming part of how
we stand METRO Proud! This month we will honor one operator for 20 years of safe driving, 2
operators and 1 officer who jumped into action to assist a toddler with a disability who was
wandering the streets of Akron on a cold morning, and a former operator who messaged me
about helping those in our community who are gravely affected by the government shutdown.
The buzz and excitement of the team as they worked diligently throughout Winter Storm Harper to
keep Summit County and the communities we serve moving. People are taking notice. One of
Summit County’s cabinet members tweeted about a SCAT operator who assisted a visually
impaired passenger into a bank on Main Street - surprised that this was the standard METRO has
set and that it is our performance on a daily basis. Our first group of new SSO operators went
into service on their own and the second group began their training this month. We are planning
our next “Official-ly on Board” rides. Our Leadership Team continued its group rides by
interacting with bus operators and passengers along the route chosen by a team member. Our
Leadership Team is also excited about our upcoming retreat with you on February 25th at the
Downtown Akron Partnership offices.
This is an exciting time and we are #METROProud!
Yours in accessible transportation,
Dawn Distler
Executive Director

On Thursday, November 1 , 2018, Executive Director Dawn Distler, Director of Operations De-Havilland
McCall, Chief Dispatcher Jamie Saylor, and Executive Board of T.W.U. (Transport Workers Union of

“Leadership Plus” was introduced to the METRO team on November 9 by Executive Director Dawn
Distler. Each director was encouraged to invite members from their department to attend an hour long
meeting. The purpose was to introduce team members to Ms. Distler and to share with her the role they play
on the METRO team. This was a wonderful opportunity and it brought various departments, who otherwise
may not have an opportunity to interact, a chance to do so.
th

The entire Leadership Team held a “Traveling Leadership Meeting” on Tuesday, November 13 , 2018. The
team traveled by bus to and from the meeting location, which was held at The Eye Opener restaurant. The
restaurant is located at 1688 West Market Street in the Wallhaven area. This outing allowed the team an
opportunity to talk with our passengers and gave us a chance to extend a big thank you to our professional
operators.
th

On November 20 , the Director of Operations and Chief Dispatcher met with the Safety and Security Council
to discuss various matters regarding safety and security at all of METRO’s facilities/properties.
DECEMBER 2018 OPERATIONS REPORT

based on seniority for 2019.
The Director of Operations, along with other team members and community leaders, participated in the first
“Official-ly On Board” campaign. This was a wonderful endeavor for community leaders to experience
th
firsthand what METRO offers to Summit County. This activity took place on Monday, December 10 , 2018.

 NOVEMBER 2018 CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PARATRANSIT REPORT

PARATRANSIT PASSENGERS:
There were 20.5 weekdays in November (ThanksFriday is a limited service day and is counted as a ½ day)
and eight weekend days, which allowed METRO and our subcontractor to transport 21,372 passengers via
paratransit. The number of passengers transported includes trips taken on the mandated ADA paratransit
program, METRO SCAT Senior, METRO SCAT Temporary, and other contracted paratransit services offered
throughout Summit County.
NON-EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION (NET):
The total number of NET trips completed in the month of November was 1,818, transporting 1,934
passengers to medical appointments as directed by the Department of Job and Family Services (DJFS). Due
to changes in the Medicaid program, DJFS has created a new process, which has significantly reduced the
number of NET trips realized by all providers, as highlighted below:

Twenty-six (26) riders using mobility devices came in for an interview where they received METRO
information and advocacy training. We successfully contacted 33 new riders through our Courtesy Call
program.
As a group, Customer Service attended meetings and gave presentations or worked at several events in the
community in November, including: Allen Dickson Apartments, Buchtel Apartments Health Fair, Akron

NON-EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION (NET):
The total number of NET trips completed in the month of December was 2,021, transporting 2,167
passengers to medical appointments as directed by the Department of Job and Family Services (DJFS). Due
to changes in the Medicaid program, DJFS has created a new process, which has significantly reduced the
number of NET trips realized by each of the three providers, METRO included. While this is a margin
increase from November, we continue to proactively collaborate with DJFS to find better ways for all
providers to serve this population along with DJFS.
TRAINING, MOBILITY, ELIGIBILTY AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT:
December was a slow month for applications, with 86, however, in 2018 we processed 1,561 a total of
applications. We continue to explore different ways to increase awareness and offer travel training to
agencies and our mutual clients. We worked with 23 individuals who came in to have their wheelchairs
weighed and measured and gave them Q’Straint webbing loops to assist our operators in safely securing
their device to our coach.
As a group, Customer Service attended meetings, gave presentations or worked at several events in the
community in December, including Villa at Marian Park, The Akron Blind Center, Tri-County Independent
Living, Mayor Horrigan’s Senior Commission, DJFS, Children Services, Leadership Akron Signature Class
Social Service Day, Ethics Seminar and worked with APTA on the nationwide Call Center Challenge.
APTA CALL CENTER CHALLENGE:
Congratulations to Brian Dean who was nominated to represent METRO in the 2019 Call Center Challenge.
The first round was completed in early January by all nominees across the nation. Judges will then listen to
all calls and choose six finalists to compete live in New Orleans at the Call Center Challenge. Good luck to
you, Brian, and thank you for a job well done!

 January 2019 Update – 2018 Summary
2018 Maintenance Highlights Include:
 Full staffing for the majority of the year
 Continuing a 4 year trend of a reduction in repeat road calls. Repeat road calls
are defined as related mechanical road calls for the same vehicle.
 The lowest number of total yearly road calls in the past 4 years. Road calls often
disrupt our service and can lead to a negative perception of METRO by our
customers.
 A 10% increase over 2017 in Miles Between Road Calls/Failures (MBRC). MBRC is
the industry standard for determining fleet reliability. The number is derived
from dividing the total fleet mileage by the number of vehicle mechanical
failures.
 On-Time Preventative Maintenance finished the year at 94%. Our most critical
inspection for our vehicles is the 6000 mile inspection, of which the team
achieved a rate of 97% on-time.

OFFICERS’ REPORT
President:
Mr. DeJournett extended his thanks to the Board for all of their hard work this past year. He also
expressed his appreciation for all who attended the Holiday Luncheon. He had a great experience
at the APTA Leadership Summit which he attended with Ms. Distler. He met many people from
around the country and noted how much Akron is known. Many people congratulated Dawn and
there was excitement about what METRO was going to be doing. The budget will be allowing
more opportunity for Board Members to attend national conferences in order to be even better
acclimated to the industry. He complimented the staff on the initiative of “Official-ly On Board”,
and was pleased with the participation of local mayors and the great opportunity to interact with
customers. He has already received requests from some clergy to do something similar. He was
hopeful that Board members would also join in and do the same.
Executive Director:
Ms. Distler said that it had been a busy and productive month. She spoke about “Official-ly On
Board”, saying that it was an eye-opener for some, and that METRO received some really good
press from it. She reported that Executive Shapiro had brought two additional mayors with her
on her bus ride who seemed to really enjoy the trip, and who were talking with fellow riders. The
Beacon Journal covered the event, as well as the Cleveland Plain Dealer and KSU. Ms. Distler
believes that the Officials who rode along learned many things they may not have expected. She
also spoke a bit about APTA, and how important it is for us to stay involved in the national scene
so that we can stay on the pulse of what it happening in the industry. She is excited to see Board
members become more involved in the organization, so that we can see what our peers are doing.
She reported on being thankful for her visit to the “Breakfast with Santa” with TWU and what a
great job Chuck Rector had done in the costume. She commented how important it was for us to
have involvement in the community, to make them feel that we care about them, and how well
those guys had done that.
The Board Retreat in February was mentioned, and that the date would be chosen during the next
few weeks. Ms. Distler wished everyone Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, Happy New Year,
and said that she looks forward to a fun and prosperous 2019. She commented that the group
she’s been given has been terrific at getting things done, and she expressed appreciation to the
Board for having such a great team here at METRO.
