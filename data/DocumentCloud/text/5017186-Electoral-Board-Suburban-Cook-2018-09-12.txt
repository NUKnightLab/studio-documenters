A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A HEARING ON THE ILLINOIS BLOCKCHAIN TASK
FORCE REPORT AND THE APPLICATIONS OF ITS FINDINGS TO COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, blockchains offer enormous potential for the storage and maintenance of data and records;
and
WHEREAS, a blockchain is a database that is replicated over a peer-to-peer network that is designed to
achieve consistent and reliable agreement over a record of events between independent participants through
consensus about changes to the state of the shared database; and
WHEREAS, blockchains allow digital information to be distributed, but not copied, making it very difficult
to inappropriately modify the original data. Anything of value, money, titles, deeds, votes, and identity
attributes can be exchanged, stored, and managed securely and privately; and
WHEREAS, there are a variety of potential applications of blockchains to manage the voluminous data
that Cook County manages, including, but not limited to, applications in the Office of the Cook County
Clerk, Recorder of Deeds, Assessor, Clerk of the Circuit Court and much more; and
WHEREAS, on November 30, 2016, the State of Illinois formed the Illinois Blockchain Initiative to
explore how Blockchain could help spur economic development in the State; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Blockchain Task Force was charged by Illinois House Joint Resolution 25, which
was adopted by both houses on June 28, 2017, to study aspects of distributed ledger technology that includes
opportunities and risks associated with using blockchain, different types of blockchains (public and private),
as well as projects and use cases in other states and domains that Illinois could consider utilizing; and
WHEREAS, on January 31, 2018, the Illinois Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force issued a
report on:
1) opportunities and risks associated with using blockchain and other distributed ledger
technologies,
2) the different types of blockchains, public and private,
3) projects and use cases in other states/nations that Illinois could consider,
4) how current state laws could be modified to support this technology,
5) encryption technology, including Illinois’ digital signature infrastructure, and
6) official reports and recommendations from the Illinois Blockchain Initiative; and
WHEREAS, the Task Force found that that blockchain technology and its built-in encryption can facilitate
highly-secure methods for interacting with government and keeping paperless records, increasing data
accuracy and providing better cybersecurity protections for Illinois residents; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that a joint meeting of the Legislation and Intergovernmental
Relations and Technology Committees of the Cook County Board of Commissioners convene to review the
Illinois Blockchain Task Force Report and the possible applications of blockchain technology within Cook
County.
