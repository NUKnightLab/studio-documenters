0 In 2016, the Council developed a new system of review for the approval of
certain NEZ certificates:

LPD assisted in developing a system for which the Council applied a greater level
of scrutiny at the NEZ Zone approval stage. The recent upswing in the use of NEZs
for the development of apartment buildings and condos downtown and in
?Downtown Revitalization Districts,? 1 instead of just neighborhood single family
residents, created a need for this review.

This Neighbourhood Enterprise Zone was established in



which is prior to the

development of a system of additional ?nancial review for NE 3 in 2016, therefore there
is no additional ?scal review for this item.
