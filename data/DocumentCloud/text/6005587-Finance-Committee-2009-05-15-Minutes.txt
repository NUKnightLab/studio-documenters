John H. Stroger, Hospital of Cook County

The sole source contract with Edward Lifesciences, Irvine,

California for Cardio?oracic supplies. Biomechanical
Heart Valves, Annuloplasty rings, stents and accessories.

We are requesting this contract for 12 months to purchase
biomechanical Carpentier-Edwards Perimount pericardial
bioprosthesis, human' tissue valves and other products
including the pericardial aorta vale, Physio Armuloplasty
Ring, The Cosgrove Annuloplasty Ring and Bovine
Percardium. .

The Edwards valve is indicated in patients that cannot

tolerate lifelong anticoagulation. The department is aware

that another mechanical prosthesis is available through

ATS Medical, the open Pivot Heart Valve. However, this
prosthesis is contraindicated for patients unable to tolerate

anticoagulation therapy and thus would not be a suitable
replacement for the Edwards prosthesis.

The pericardial valve is a stented aortic valve that seems to

have the best life span of all current available biologic
valves. It also has a low pro?le, which makes it easier to
implant. The Physio?and Cosgrove Annuloplasty Rings
each have unique characterics for speci?c types of mitral
valve repair.

The human valve is used for certain, Speci?c indications,
including, the transfer of pulmonary vale to the aortic
position in young patient and also use of aortic valves in
the aortic position for what' is hoped to be the best
longevity of non-mechanical valve.
