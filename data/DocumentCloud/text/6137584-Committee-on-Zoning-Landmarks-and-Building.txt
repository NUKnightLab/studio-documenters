Purpose:

The building at tgef W Belmont is a six unit residential plus two
unit commercial building built by a developer, PSS
Enterprises. Thè City filed a case against the developer, general
contractor, and the condo association because the building was
built conkary tolplans and in excess of the allowable flooiarea
ratio. The City {evoked PSS Enterprises general contractor,s
license and fined them over a hundred thousand dollars. Having
now exhausted legal remedies for the illegal actions of the
developer, the Qepartment of Law's reconunended that we ïezone
the property so that the innocent purchasers can legalize the
building. subsed-uent to the approval of permits foithe previously
illegal work, thelAlderman will request that the zoning Èe
returned to the prior classification.
