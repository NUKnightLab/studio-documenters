Due to the absence of Committee Chair Ivers, Commissioner Reidy presented the report for the
Finance and Audit Committee. Per Commissioner Reidy, the Finance & Audit Committee held
its regular meeting on Wednesday, September 15th at approximately 1:10 p.m. at the 60 East Van
Buren Corporate offices. The Chief Financial Officer and staff presented the Committee with
the Treasury & Cash Flow Report for the month of August 2010.
Commissioner Reidy then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of Resolutions for Items
A1 thru A4 discussed, voted and recommended for approval by the Finance and Audit
Committee:
(Item A1)
A Request For Proposal (RFP) for Internal Auditing Services was released on June 28, 2010 and
advertised in various area newspapers. The solicitation was also sent directly to five vendors.
Twenty four vendors accessed the RFP, and four proposals were received. Based on the initial
evaluation, three firms were determined to be in the competitive range. Oral discussions were
conducted with and the evaluation team scored the information presented by each firm. Based
on the evaluation committee scores and Best and Final Offers, Ernst & Young (E&Y) was
determined to be the best overall respondent whose proposal’s technical factors and pricing were
2

 most advantageous to the CHA. During the past five years under its previous contract with CHA,
E&Y met its contract requirements and has performed all tasks expected of the independent
auditors. E&Y utilized expertise from its various audit practices to deliver key solutions to
critical accounting and financial issues on behalf of the CHA. Accordingly, the resolution for
Item A1 approves award of contract to Ernst & Young to provide independent auditing services
to the CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-104
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated September 15, 2010, entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO
EXECUTE CONTRACT WITH ERNST & YOUNG, LLP TO PROVIDE
INDEPENDENT AUDITING SERVICES”:
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute a firm fixed price Contract with Ernst & Young, LLP to
provide independent professional auditing services for a base period of two years
for fiscal years ending December 31, 2010 and 2011 for an of $1,420,00 and with
three one year options.

(Item A2)
In June 2010, CHA directly and indirectly solicited requests for insurance premium quotes from
16 carriers. Aon received quotes from many new carriers with only the property carriers and auto
carrier remaining the same. After reviewing the responses, Aon and CHA’s Risk Management
Department recommended the insurers listed in the resolution below to provide the required
insurance coverage for CHA for the period October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011. The
recommended awards to these carriers maintain the same policy limits and retention levels for all
lines except for Employment Practices Insurance and Public Officials Liability. The soft
insurance market combined with one of the incumbent carriers refusal to quote, resulted in many
new carriers quoting greatly reduced premiums. Excess Liability and General and Auto Liability
were restructured and resulted in substantial savings since the Authority was able to take
advantage of the soft insurance market and marketing skills of Aon. Since insurance coverage is
designated by HUD as a supply & delivery product, Section 3 requirements are not applicable to
this procurement. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A2 approves award of contract to the
insurance carriers listed below.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-105
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated September
15, 2010 entitled "AUTHORIZATION FOR THE CHA TO AWARD GENERAL
LIABILITY, EXCESS LIABILITY, PUBLIC OFFICIALS LIABILITY, ALL
RISK PROPERTY, EMPLOYED LAWYERS ERRORS AND OMISSIONS
LIABILITY, EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY, AUTO LIABILITY,
CRIME AND FIDUCIARY LIABILITY COVERAGE”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to award the following insurance coverage for the CHA for the period of
October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011 for an aggregate amount not-toexceed $1,407,735 through its insurance broker of record, Aon Risk Services
Central, Inc. (“Aon”): (1) General Liability written though Liberty Surplus in an
amount not-to-exceed $35,224; (2) Excess Liability coverage written through
RSUI in an amount not-to-exceed $61,124; (3) Public Officials Liability written

 (Item A3 – NOT APPROVED)
In January 2010 the CHA advertised Request for Proposal (RFP) for Client Management
Tracking System (CMTS) services. The solicitation sought both Software and Implementation
Services for the CMTS initiative. Of the eight proposals received, six vendors were selected
based on the competitive range. The CMTS Team worked with the two finalists on the
development of a Statement of Work (SOW), including a detailed project schedule and pricing
information that would assist CHA in selecting the vendor who would implement the best
solution. Upon careful evaluation of each of the vendor’s software products, implementation
approaches and pricing, the CMTS Team recommended Model Metrics as the proposed awardee
for the Client Management Tracking System project. The determination was based upon
technical, pricing and other factors, and was the result of the evaluation team’s conclusion that
Model Metrics’ proposal represented the best solution and overall value to the CHA for the
CMTS project.
Commissioners Beverly, King and Young Abstained from voting on Item A3.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHAWHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated September 15,
2010, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
MODEL METRICS AND SALESFORCE.COM TO IMPLEMENT A CLIENT
MANAGEMENT TRACKING SYSTEM”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee enter a contract with Model Metrics, Inc. and
Salesforce.com to provide a Client Management Tracking System in the total
fixed-fee project amount of $2,270,592 for two years with one option year. This
authorization includes funding for the implementation phase of the project in the
fixed-fee amount of $990,780, with optional Consulting Services in the amount of
$137,280 with Model Metrics, Inc., for a total of $1,128,060, and also includes
funding for User License fees with Salesforce.com in the amount of $780,612 for
two year base term and $361,920 for the option year, for a total fixed-fee amount
of $1,142,532.

(Item A4)
The Office of Information Technology Services is responsible for providing a systematic and
effective program for managing the life cycle of the CHA’s records and storage to support the
agency’s operations. Prudent business practices dictate having storage and service agreements in
place to ensure critical business records are maintained. Accordingly, the CHA issued a Request
for Proposal (RFP) in June 2009. This RFP competitively solicited qualified firms and/or
individuals who could provide Offsite Record Storage Services to the CHA. Of the six responses
received R4 Services LLC was the most responsible respondent and its proposal was the most
advantageous to CHA. A contract was, therefore, awarded to R4 Services LLC for an amount of
not-to-exceed $64,500.00 for a one year base term, with three one year options. R4 Services has
performed according to the contract and has provided reliable and quality services to CHA
during the base year term. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A4 approves extension of
contract with R4 services for the first option year in the not-to-exceed amount of $64,500.00.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA106
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 15,
2010, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXERCISE THE FIRST ONE (1) YEAR
OPTION WITH R4 SERVICES LLC FOR OFFSITE RECORD STORAGE
SERVICES”,
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to exercise the first one (1) year extension option of Contract No. 9069

Habitat advertised a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) in January 2010 for a Master Developer
and Property Management Team for the Redevelopment of the Julia C. Lathrop Homes. Habitat
advertised the RFQ in area newspapers, the United States Green Building Council Chicago
Chapter and CHA website. Habitat also directly solicited 231 firms, including 23 assist agencies
and received six proposals. The Evaluation Committee, comprised of members of the Lathrop
Homes Working Group, reviewed the proposals and developed its recommendation to
CHA/Habitat based on the criteria and requirements outlined in the RFQ. The Evaluation
Committee reviewed and scored the proposals, and Habitat determined that five of the
Respondents were within the Competitive Range. Upon further consideration of each respondent
following presentation, the Evaluation Committee recommended that the highest-ranked team be
asked to lead an open community planning process for the redevelopment of Lathrop Homes.
Lathrop Community Partner (LCP) was the highest ranked team based on the Evaluation
Committee scoring of the qualification criteria. The second and third-ranked teams have also

Based on the Abstentions of Commissioners Beverly, King and Young, the resolution for Item
B1: “Recommendation to approve the Development Team of Lathrop Community Partners
(LCP), and authorization for the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into
negotiations for a Master Development Agreement and to initiate revitalization planning for
Lathrop Homes” did not have a majority vote, therefore, this resolution should not have been
adopted. This resolution was inadvertently declared as “Approved”. As soon as the error was
noted, Commissioners and Executive Staff were notified and advised that this item would have
to come before the Board for a re-vote at the October 19th Board Meeting.
Based on the Majority Votes for Items B2 and B4 thru B10, Commissioner Ponce thereupon
declared said Motion carried and said resolutions adopted.
The Operations and Facilities Committee Meeting report was also accepted in total.
Commissioner Sandra Young, Chairperson of the Tenant Services Committee then presented her
monthly report. Per Commissioner Young, the Tenant Services Committee held its regular
meeting on Wednesday, September 15th at approximately 2:40 p.m. Staff from the Office of
Resident Services presented the Committee with an update on Operation Warm.
Commissioner Young then presented an Omnibus Motion for adoption of the Resolutions for
Items C1 thru C5 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Operations and
Facilities Committee.
(Item C1)
The resolution for Item C1 approves extension of contract with Housing Choice Partners of
Illinois (HCP) to continue to provide Good Neighbor Services for residents currently living in
CHA developments and mixed-income communities, as well as former 10/1/99 CHA residents
who have temporarily relocated to the private market with a Housing Choice Voucher. During
the term of their contract, HCP has performed all its contractual obligations. The Contract’s
primary focus is to conduct Good Neighbor workshops that will provide residents moving into
the scattered site portfolio through the Property Investment Initiative (PII) and residents
screening for Property Rental Assistance units (PRA) with the necessary tools to maintain their
household, their finances and foster positive and lasting relationships within their communities.
HCP conducts a series of workshops prior to residents being approved for a unit in the PII
portfolio and assists in the move-in process with the Property Manager and CHA. HCP will
provide a minimum of four follow-up visits throughout the first year of residing in the new unit.
Additionally, HCP will provide intensive, one-on-one services for residents in CHA’s family,
senior and mixed-income portfolios with lease compliance issues related to housekeeping. HCP
will work with residents to develop an individual plan to maintain lease compliance including,
but not limited to, multiple in-home visits and hands on assistance (e.g. storage and
organizational assistance) for residents with housekeeping violations..

RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-116
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated September 15, 2010, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO
EXERCISE THE SECOND ONE-YEAR OPTION CONTRACT NO. 8065
WITH EMPLOYMENT & EMPLOYER SERVICES, INC. TO PROVIDE
GOOD NEIGHBOR SERVICES”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to exercise the second one-year option of Contract No. 8065 with the
Employment & Employer Services, Inc. (“Contract”) to provide Good Neighbor
services for the period of October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011, and to

(Item C3)
The resolution for Item C3 approves the FY2010 Admission and Continued Occupancy Policy
(ACOP) and Residential Lease Agreement. The FY2010 ACOP amends the September 2009
Board of Commissioners approved ACOP and the FY2010 Lease amends the September 2009
Board approved Lease. Changes are being made to the ACOP and Lease to ensure that the
language conforms to federal law, federal regulations, and state law. In summary, the new
requirement is as follows: “In accordance with 24 CFR 5.216, 24 CFR 5.218, and 24 CFR
5.233, all Applicants and Residents are required to disclose Social Security Numbers or make a
declaration, under penalties of perjury, that they do not have a Social Security Number.” The
FY2010 ACOP and Lease also clarifies the definition of Total Tenant Payment (TTP) and
Minimum Rent. The minimum TTP shall be $75 per month. Whenever the TTP calculation
results in an amount less than $75, the CHA will impose a TTP of $75. CHA presented key
changes in the FY2010 ACOP to the Central Advisory Council (CAC) Executive Board and the
council at large and their legal representatives on March 25, 2010. The proposed changes to the
FY2010 ACOP were also presented to CHA executive staff, department directors, and assistant
directors for review. Notice to residents and the public about the public comment period and
hearing appeared in news ads in the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Defender, and El Dia on
March 16 and 17, 2010. The public comment period for the draft FY2010 ACOP was held
March 17, 2010 through April 15, 2010. A public comment hearing was held on March 29,
2010, at the Charles Hayes Family Investment Center. In finalizing the proposed amendment to
the FY2010 ACOP, CHA gave consideration to comments received during the public comment
period and public comment hearing.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-117
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 15,
2010 entitled “Recommendation to Approve the FY2010 Admission and
Continued Occupancy Policy and Residential Lease Agreement”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the FY2010 Admission and
Continued Occupancy Policy and Residential Lease Agreement, and authorizes
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to approve any final changes to the
FY2010 Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy and Residential Lease
Agreement.

THAT,

this approval of the FY2010 Admissions and Continued Occupancy Policy and
Residential Lease Agreement supersedes any and all conflicting language found
in prior CHA policies and procedures and replaces any and all previously board
approved Admission and Continued Occupancy Policies and Residential Lease
Agreements.

THAT,

the Chief Executive Officer is hereby authorized to approve final changes in this
policy and lease agreement. Such approval shall constitute conclusive evidence
of the Board’s approval of any and all such changes.

(Item C4)
The resolution for Item C4 approves an amendment to Contract No. 9009 with Screening
Reports Inc. to increase the Contract’s not to exceed amount by $160,000.00 to provide tenant
services necessary screening services for the CHA. To ensure continued compliance with CHA’s
Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Administrative Plan and 24 CFR 982.553 (Denial of admission
and termination of assistance for criminals and alcohol abusers) HCV Program screens adult
household members for certain types of criminal activity before admission to the program, at a
move, for adult additions to the household, or head of household changes. The background
check is then provided to CHA, which is used as assistance for a final determination. On March
16, 2010, the Board authorized the CHA to amend the contract with Screening Reports, Inc so
that the HCV Program could take advantage of the Contract and to increase the Contract’s notto-exceed amount. Subsequently, the HCV Program’s special Improving Properties Initiative
(IPI) (and data matching agreement with CPD), resulted in the HCV Program running
background checks for all HCV households admitted prior to FY2010. In addition, the modified
HCV FY2010 Administrative Plan states, “HCVP will run a criminal background check on each
adult family member 18 years and older, including Live-In-Aides at admission, annual
reexaminations, at interim reexaminations, and moves”. Because of this increased volume of
screening reports, the HCV Program is requesting authorization to add $160,000 to the
Contract’s not-to-exceed amount to cover the costs of running these additional criminal
background checks. Additionally, Screening Reports, Inc. has agreed to provide the CHA with
segregated billing for this special initiative at a reduced cost of $5 per screening.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-118
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated September 15, 2010, entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO
EXECUTE AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO CONTRACT NO.9009 WITH
SCREENING REPORTS, INC. FOR TENANT SCREENING SERVICES”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to execute an amendment to Contract No. 9009 (“Contract”) with
Screening Reports Inc. to increase the Contract’s not to exceed amount by
$160,000.00 to provide tenant services necessary screening services for the CHA.
The contract’s new aggregate not-to-exceed funding amount will be $542,000.00.

At the request of staff, Item C5: Recommendation to extend Contract No. 9078 with Nan McKay
