presented the 2019 work plan and budget. Overall the budget is the same as
2018; the tax rate does not need to be increased because there are sufficient
funds to cover programs.

and it covers what the City’s program does not.
2. RPBA staff will update the SSA one-pager to include Graffiti
Removal and other programs we fund.
3. Bike Racks funding was decreased in part because there are
alternative routes for bicycles in the area.
4. RPBA will create a highlighted list of items on the agenda that we
are not spending money on so we can either further promote the
item or remove it.
5. Pete asked if there is a way to track vacancies. RPBA will work on
a scope/cost for tracking vacancies. Talk with Sparkfactor about
commercial attraction posters for vacancies. The district needs a
coffee place.
