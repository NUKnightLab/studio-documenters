intangible assets , recorded at cost at the time of receipt and, in case of construction in progress, are

• Capital assets are defined by CCH as assets with initial, individual costs of $5,000 or more and with
estimated time benefit beyond one year.
• Depreciation is the allocation of the cost of a capital asset over the estimated useful life of each class of
assets. Estimated useful life is as follows;
• Land Improvements

5-25 years

• Buildings

What is a Capital Budgeting?
• As part of annual budgeting process, the County reviews and assess it capital programming needs regarding
• Capital Improvement to facilities

• Transportation and Highways
• Capital Equipment purchases
• Capital programming entails the review of short, medium and long-term capital investments required to
promote the efficient and effective provision of services to Cook County residents and a determination of the
County’s willingness and ability to issue new-taxpayer funded debt for capital expenditures and/or fund
capital projects through operating budgets.
• Capital budgeting aims to achieve a prudent balancing of legacy debt obligations, operating budget priorities ,
and debt service costs.

• In FY2019, the County proposed;
• $274.9M for Capital Improvement Program (CIP) - CCH debt funded portion $104.3M
• $84.9M for Transportation & Highways
• $99.2M for Capital Equipment Program (CEP)

- CCH funded portion $4.8M, CCDPH Special funds
$200K

 Environmental Scan of Market, Best Practices and Trends
2017 Credit Ratings Agencies Common Themes
• Emergence of non-traditional entrants looking to ‘disrupt’ healthcare delivery
• Payor mix shifts from commercial plans to government payors

• Continuing pressure on hospitals and health systems balance sheets with increasing bad debts, constrained
profitability, operating margin and operating cash flow
o Revenue growth will be constrained by low patient volume growth and higher bad debt as co-pays and deductibles rise
o Expense growth challenges and need for management focus on cost efficiency measures

• 340B risks and other drug price increases
• Political risks including challenges and/or administrative changes to Affordable Care Act
• Continuing mergers, acquisitions and consolidation activities
