presented at the next Board Meeting. Following the discussion, a suggestion was made to have an update on recruitment

 Overview of FY2017 Unaudited Financial Results – Preliminary

Full accrual of State change in rates (“clawback”) for FY2016 & 17 ($110M)
Proposed settlement of FY2014/15 capitation contract ($10M)
Additional revenue from FHN members of $66 million
Expenses:
External claims exceeded budget by $176M in FY2017 (including $50M in claims that
were incurred in November, but have not been billed to us at November 30th related
to Family Health Network [FHN] members joining CountyCare).
Expenditures other than external claims were $32M above budget. This was not
identified earlier due to the transition to the new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
system.

February 28, 2018

 

Employee Recognition

Rev. Carol Reese, Program Director of Healing Hurt People Chicago, was featured in the American Hospital
Association?s special report on Hospitals Against Violence this February. The AHA cited Healing Hurt People as a
program that is working to address gun violence in Chicago. Launched in August 2013, the hospital-based violence
intervention program Healing Hurt People-Chicago is a collaboration between the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County, The University of Chicago Comer Children?s Hospital and the Center for Nonviolence and Social Justice at Drexel
University in Philadelphia. Through assessment, intensive case management, group therapy and
mentoring, HHP-C helps youth who?ve been violently injured heal both physically and emotionally.

Last month, Cook County was hit with a bad winter storm that dumped several inches of snow over the course of two
days, making traveling to and from more challenging. Many of our employees made it to their shift despite the winter
storm or stayed over to provide extra coverage in key areas. And because of their dedication, clinical operations
were relatively unaffected. But we especially wanted to recognize Swapanil Dean, who went above and beyond to get
to work on February 8. Dean, who is an echo sonographer, biked 12 miles in the snow to his shift at Stroger Hospital
demonstrating his commitment to serving our patients.

The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) has officially granted the Ambulatory and
Community Health Network (ACHN) Stage 7 designation. Stage 7 is the highest level of Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
implementation, and recognizes success in fully implementing our EMR across our Health System. Only 10% of
American clinics have reached stage 7. ACHN joins Stroger and Provident Hospitals that achieved Level 7 in late 2017,
placing them in the top 6% of American acute care institutions and making hospitals 2 of only 7 Illinois hospitals
that have achieved this recognition. The following people played a key role in planning and preparing the Stage 7
implementation: Debra Carey, Donna Hart, Kathy Pavkov, Keisha Barber, Dr. David Barker, Andrew Bullock, Alex Cross,
Katina Daher, Dr. Thomas Gavagan, Stephen Goldston, Marty Grant, Amanda Grasso, Bessie Hardy, Lisa Hobson, Edith
Johns, Amy Looi, Maria Moore, Dr. LaMorris Perry, Bryan Pravel, Jason Raidbard, Lajewell Thompson and Roger
Urban.

Local chapters of the National Black Nurses Association met on February 23, 2018 to honor nurses as part of the 30th
Annual National Black Nurses Day. Five nurses were recognized during the event for their outstanding
contributions to correctional health care, Carol Boyd, Agnes Jones-Perry, Kim Anderson, Diane Morrison and Shawn
Withers.

Legislative Update

Local

The Nominating Committee (NomCom) for the Cook County Health Hospitals System Board met on
January 29, 2018 for the purpose of identifying candidates to fill the unexpired term of Board Director Ric
Estrada. The NomCom submitted the names of three candidates to the County Board President for
consideration. On February 7, 2018 President Preckwinkle submitted her appointment of David Ernesto Munar
to the Cook County Board for approval. The appointment was referred to the Cook County Board?s Legislation
Committee for consideration. A Legislation Committee hearing is expected to be scheduled prior to full
ratification by the Cook County Board tentatively scheduled for March 13, 2018.

Mr. Munar is the President and CEO of Howard Brown Health, a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)
focused on the health needs of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender population. Prior to
Howard Brown Health, Mr. Munar worked for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago for 23 years serving as Policy
Director, Vice President of Policy and Communication, Senior Vice President, and then President and CEO.

At the February 7, 2018 Cook County Board meeting, President Preckwinkle and Commissioners Daley, Morrison
and Fritchey introduced a resolution pertaining to Information Technology consolidation. The proposed
resolution was referred to committee for consideration. A committee meeting to consider the resolution has
not yet been scheduled.

The proposed resolution directs the undertaking of an Information Technology Consolidation Study and the
submission of recommendations to the Cook County Board within 120 days of passage of the resolution. The
purpose of the IT Consolidation Study is to evaluate IT operations across all Cook County agencies and offices for
duplication and potential opportunities to consolidate and centralize functions and services.

In addition, the resolution directs the County?s Chief Information Officer to draft a proposed Information
Technology Governance Ordinance that ensures all Information Technology investments funded by Cook County
Board-authorized expenditures are in accord with industry best practices and are made pursuant to Countywide
technology standards, strategic plans, and policies; and ensures all Cook County agencies and offices are
protected by coordinated and up-to?date information security and privacy policies.

Also at the February 7, 2018 County Board meeting an amendment to the County?s Procurement Code was
introduced and referred to committee for consideration. The Ordinance Amendment proposes to increase the

The Governor delivered his State-of?the-State address on January 31, 2018. The speech focused on economic
development, veterans? issues, property tax relief, term limits, and criminal justice reforms. Limited remarks
were made related to health care and were focused on combating the opioid epidemic, including touting the
launch of a 24/7 hotline for those who are seeking recovery services, the use of the Prescription Monitoring
Program, and a statewide goal to reduce projected opioid deaths by one-third. The Governor also mentioned
successful efforts to root out in Medicaid fraud. The full text of the speech can be found 

The Governor?s budget address took place February 14, 2018. Specific to healthcare, the Governor mentioned
that Medicaid enrollment is expected to remain flat in FY19 at about 3.1M enrolled, and that work continues
between the state and the federal government to seek approval for Illinois? 1115 Medicaid waiver focused
behavioral health. The Governor?s FY19 budget proposes a 4% rate reduction to Medicaid providers that are not
protected by federal law. The full text of the address can be found _h_er_e.

The Governor?s budget is the start of a negotiation process with the Illinois General Assembly with anticipated
resolution by May 31, 2018, which is the last regular day of the legislative session and the deadline to pass bills
with a simple majority approval.

A bipartisan, bicameral legislative working group has been working with the Illinois Hospital Association, the
Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS), and other stakeholders on hospital assessment
redesign language. SB1773 served as the primary vehicle for the bill, with SB1573 as a ?trailer? bill that included
additional language requested by stakeholders indirectly related to the hospital assessment redesign process
and Medicaid. SB1773 also included language requested by and the University of Illinois Hospital and
Health Sciences System (UIHHSS) that would allow our institutions to directly receive Medicaid Graduate
Medical Education payments.

On February 28, the House passed the primary hOspital assessment bill, SB1773 with a vote of 107-7-0; the
Senate concurred with a vote of 53-3-1. The trailer bill, SB1573 also passed the House with a vote of 110?0?1,
and the Senate concurred with a vote of 56-0-1. The bill now heads to the Governor's desk for his signature.
Federal officials will need to approve the new hospital assessment redesign and the GME
payments in order for these changes to take effect on the anticipated start date ofJuly 1, 2018.

After a brief government shutdown, Congress passed and the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018
into law on February 9, 2018. In addition to lifting the statutory budget caps, providing full year appropriations
for the Department of Defense and extending stopgap funding for the rest of the federal government until
March 23, 2018 the bill addressed a number of health policy matters. The bill delayed the cuts to Medicaid
Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for two more years
(until September 30, 2019). It extended the Children?s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for an additional four
years, beyond the six authorized at the end ofJanuary 2018. The bill also funds community health centers for
two years. The bill cut the Prevention and Public Health Fund by $1.353 over ten years. About to address
the opioid epidemic and mental health was also included though funding allocations will be made through the
appropriations process.

On February 12 2018, the Administration released the President?s budget request for FFY2019. While many of its

proposals would require Congress to enact legislation, the document is an indicator of the Administration?s

aspirations and priorities. The following as some key elements of the request.

0 The enactment of legislation to repeal and replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)
based on the Graham?Cassidy bill as soon as possible, followed by additional unspecified reforms, for

in net mandatory savings across the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department
of the Treasury.

A proposed new Market-Based Health Care Grant Program which states could use to support health care
access for those formerly covered by ACA plans or Medicaid.

Elimination of state ?gimmicks? like provider taxes, which increase federal costs. Medicaid financing
mechanisms like intergovernmental transfers and certified public expenditures could fall under this
classification.

Announces that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will propose guidance to improve
data collection on Medicaid supplemental payments, including the financing of such payments.

Proposes limiting Medicaid reimbursement to government providers ?to no more than the cost of providing
services to Medicaid beneficiaries."

Requests across HHS for opioid abuse prevention and treatment, including in new resources for
FFY2019 and a total of $55 over five years.

Proposes requiring state Medicaid programs to cover all three FDA-approved Medication Assisted
Treatment (MAT) options including methadone, buprenorphine and Vivitrol.

Announces that CMS will issue guidance to reduce clinical abuse and require states to track and act on high
prescribers and utilizers.

0 There had been indications that the House Committee on Energy and Commerce was preparing to take up
legislation to reform 340B Drug Discount Program -- specifically to halt the addition of new 3408 sites and impose
new data collection and reporting on 340B entities. It now appears that this may be pushed back because the
Committee Chairman has laid out plans for hearings and markups on opioid legislation with the goal of having a
comprehensive bill on the floor by Memorial Day.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
