Mr. Degnan introduced the Funds lobbyists. Mr. McCabe and Mr. Molaro discussed the status of the
pending pension reform bills and what is likely to occur during the veto session. The lobbyists
explained that SB512 includes both benefits changes and Board reconstitution. With respect to
benefits they indicated that the solutions are designed primarily for the State Systems but that the
County Funds were included. They discussed HB3813 and described the fraud provisions contained
therein.
The Trustees discussed the duty of the Board to oppose legislation that negatively impacts the Funds
and the likelihood of passage of any pending legislation.
Ms. Bums further explained that the Trustees should consider what they need to do in order to
protect the integrity and the solvency of the Fund. She also advised that the Trustees should avoid
advocating the level of benefits that may be appropriate for the members and that the Trustees should
focus on funding issues. She explained that they should administer rather than advocate for the
Fund.
Ms. Bums and the Trustees discussed the funding obligation of the County and the responsibility
of the County to fund the liabilities of the Funds beyond the statutory obligation. They discussed
notifying all members of the State Legislature of the funding issues facing the Funds and that ARC
funding must be a part of any solution to the problem.
