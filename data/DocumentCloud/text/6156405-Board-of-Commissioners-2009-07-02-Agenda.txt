RESOLUTION
ITEM #2
APPROVED
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System is comprised of three public hospitals and
numerous health clinics that provide care to the uninsured, the underinsured and those in need in Cook
County and across northeastern Illinois; and
WHEREAS, like other public safety net hospitals across our country, the large majority of the system’s
patients are either Medicaid-eligible or uninsured; and
WHEREAS, the United States Congress has begun debate on national health care reform to ensure, as
much as possible, that the people of the United States have the ability to obtain quality and affordable
health care when needed; and
WHEREAS, this elected body fully supports the expansion of health care coverage to all in the 111th
Congress of the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, the nation’s public health infrastructure at all governmental levels must be strengthened
with sustained funding to expand the delivery of effective preventive services; and
WHEREAS, hospitals across the United States of America that treat a large number of low-income
patients qualify for “Disproportionate Share Hospital” (DSH) payments to compensate for higher-thanaverage costs generated by uninsured and underinsured patients; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System is a major recipient of Medicaid
Disproportionate Share funds, allowing it to remain the backbone of the safety net care network in
northeastern Illinois, helping to pay for the uninsured and Medicaid underpayments in the Cook County
Health & Hospitals System; and
WHEREAS, Medicaid Disproportionate Share payments have come under scrutiny by members of the
United States Congress as an unnecessary component of health care reform; and
WHEREAS, proposals to eliminate or greatly reduce disproportionate share payments to hospitals have
been offered during the debate on health care reform, including one to reduce the program by 75% by
2019.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Board of Commissioners hereby
urge the Honorable Members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation to reject all proposals to reduce
Medicaid DSH cuts as part of health reform to ensure the stability of the fragile health care safety net
system during this time of health reform transition; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Illinois Congressional Delegation seek an evaluation of health
reform and its impact on the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, including its uncompensated care
costs and its Medicaid payments after a suitable period to determine what, if any, changes should be made
to the Medicaid DSH program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to the Honorable
Members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.

liable to the County for an administrative penalty of $500.00 plus any towing and storage fees applicable
under this division. Any such vehicle shall be subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this
division. This subsection shall not apply if:
(1)

The vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the time and the theft was reported to the
appropriate police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably
should have been discovered; or

(2)

The vehicle is operating as a common carrier and the violation occurs without the

(c)
Seizure and impoundment. Whenever the Sheriff or his agent has probable cause to
believe that a vehicle is subject to a seizure and impoundment pursuant to this division, the Sheriff shall
provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility controlled by the County or its agents. Before or at the
time the vehicle is towed, the Sheriff shall notify any person identifying himself/herself as the owner of
the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation
of the fact of the seizure and of the alleged violation and of the vehicle owner's right to request a vehicle
impoundment hearing to be conducted under this section. The Sheriff may issue rules and regulations
related to this section for enforcement notification procedures and proper forms necessary for
administration of this section.
(d)

pursuant to this division makes a request in person and in writing for a vehicle impoundment hearing
within 12 48 hours after the seizure, a hearing officer of the County shall conduct the vehicle
impoundment hearing within 24 48 hours after the seizure request excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal
holidays. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the vehicle
impoundment hearing. The formal and technical rules of evidence shall not apply in the conduct of the
hearing. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it is a type commonly relied upon by
reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer
determines that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment
under Subsection (a), the hearing officer shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as
provided in this division unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the County a cash bond in the amount
of $500.00 plus any applicable towing and storage fees.

seized. The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer of the County. All interested persons shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer
determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle violated this section and that none of the
exceptions described in Subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section applies, the hearing officer shall enter an
order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the County for an administrative penalty
in the amount of $500.00. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall

vehicle shall be given to that person if the person agrees in writing to refund to the County the amount of
the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, up to
$500.00 plus the applicable fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a lien holder shall be entitled to take

applicable under this division upon submission of the following information to the Sheriff or his
designated agent on a form provided for that purpose:

amount owed to the County, then the lien holder shall pay the County as much as is
available from the surplus, if any, and the lien holder shall not shall not have any further
liability to the County for such sums. The written agreement shall further provide that if

REFORMING HEALTH CARE RESPONSIBLY
WHEREAS, experts from across the political spectrum agree that America’s health system is

important that any measure makes deliberate and responsible reforms to our healthcare system and
reinforces the strength of American healthcare while addressing the shortcomings; and

giving Americans more options and control over their health care decisions. Reform must improve the
quality of care by focusing on prevention and wellness, employing technologies to reduce errors and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION URGING IMMEDIATE PASSAGE OF
COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION
WHEREAS, experts from across the political spectrum agree that America’s health system is “broken”
and unsustainable in its present configuration; and
WHEREAS, families in Cook County are experiencing this crisis right now, confronting the high cost of
health care that threatens their financial stability, leaves them exposed to higher premiums and
deductibles, and puts them at risk for a possible loss of health insurance; and
WHEREAS, employer-sponsored health insurance premiums have nearly doubled in recent years making
it increasingly difficult for employers, including county governments, to provide health insurance
coverage for their employees and retirees; and
WHEREAS, millions of Americans do not have health coverage, or have inadequate coverage and as our
economic challenges multiply, the problem of health care access grows, further straining counties’
capacity to provide care for the uninsured, underinsured and medically indigent; and
WHEREAS, according to 2007 U.S. Census Bureau data, 1.2 million individuals living in the City of
Chicago and the surrounding Metropolitan Area are uninsured, and while the majority of these individuals
are working, fully 41% earn just $25,000 or less and they cannot afford private health coverage; and
WHEREAS, county officials are elected to protect the health and welfare of their constituents; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s Health & Hospitals System is the largest provider of indigent care in the
County and the State, currently spending more than half - 55.5% - of its total expenditures in delivering
care to the uninsured who do not have the ability to pay for their medical services. As such, the County
does not receive payment for the overwhelming majority of this care, but, rather, it is subsidized by
County taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, the National Association of Counties (NACo) Health System Reform Working Group,
appointed by President Don Stapley in July 2008 and chaired by President-Elect Valerie Brown, has held
three regional hearings to explore the health crisis and to hear what county officials believe should be
done about it and has summarized its findings in Restoring the Partnership for American Health:
Counties in a 21st Century Health System which was approved and adopted by resolution of the NACo
Health Steering Committee and Board of Directors on March 9, 2009.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners endorses
NACo’s health reform principles, as summarized in Restoring the Partnership for American Health:
Counties in a 21st Century Health System; namely, that reform legislation should:
a. restore the partnership between county and federal governments;
b. provide access to affordable, quality health care to all;
c. invest in public health, including health promotion and disease and injury prevention;
d. stabilize and strengthen the local health care safety net system, especially Medicaid and
Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments;
e. invest in the development of the health professional and paraprofessional workforce;
f.

ensure that county health agencies have the resources to meaningfully use health information
technology;

g. enable elderly and disabled persons to receive the services they need in the least restrictive
environment; and
h. reform the delivery and financing of health services in the jail system.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board strongly urges the 111th Congress of the United States
to enact comprehensive health reform legislation without delay before the end of its first session.

BUREAU OF FINANCE
ORDINANCE
ITEM #17
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 25, 2009 from
JOSEPH M. FRATTO, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance
transmitting herewith for your consideration is a Proposed Ordinance designating a recovery zone in and
for the County of Cook, Illinois.
On September, 17 2008, the Board of Commissioners adopted an ordinance authorizing one or more
series of general obligation bonds (the “Master Bond Ordinance”) to finance, among other things, the
Public Safety Funds Project, the Health Fund Project, the Corporate Fund Project and the Capital
Equipment Project (said portion of the proposed bonds being the “Project Bonds”).
On February 17, 2009, the Congress of the United States enacted the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Stimulus Act”), which authorizes the issuance of “build America bonds.”
“Build America bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of
35% of the interest coming due on the bonds.
On June 8, 2009, the Board amended the Master Bond Ordinance to provide for the designation of some
or all of the Project Bonds as “build America bonds” so as to receive the 35% subsidy.
The Stimulus Act also provides that if certain requirements are met, “build America bonds” can be further
designated as “recovery zone economic development bonds.” “Recovery zone economic development
bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of 45% of the interest
due on the bonds instead of the otherwise applicable 35%.
To designate “build America bonds” as “recovery zone economic development bonds” the Stimulus Act
requires (i) the Secretary of the United States Treasury to have awarded the issuer a portion of a
nationwide volume limitation and (ii) the issuer to have designated a “recovery zone,” in each case prior
to issuing the bonds.
On June 12, 2009, the Secretary of the United States Treasury awarded the County an allocation of
$131,209,000 for “recovery zone economic development bonds.”
On June, 18 2009, the County entered into a bond purchase agreement providing for the issuance on July
7, 2009, of $251,410,000 Taxable General Obligation Bonds, Series 2009B (Build America Bonds Direct Payment) (the “Series 2009B Bonds”), which are eligible to receive the 35% subsidy.
To designate a portion of the Series 2009B Bonds as “recovery zone economic development bonds” in
order to receive a 45% subsidy for that portion (instead of the otherwise applicable 35% subsidy), the
Board is now requested to designate a recovery zone, as provided in the proposed Ordinance.
Please note, the County also received an allocation of $196,814,000 for “recovery zone facility bonds,” a
new category of tax-exempt bonds (similar to industrial development revenue bonds). Designation of the
recovery zone is also a condition precedent to the issuance of such bonds, should the County decide to do
so at a later date.
Approval of the Ordinance designating the County of Cook a recovery zone is hereby requested.
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
An Ordinance Designating a Recovery Zone in and for The County
of Cook, Illinois.
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners (the “Corporate Authorities”) of The County of Cook,
Illinois, (the “County”), on the 17th day of September, 2008, adopted an ordinance authorizing the
issuance of one or more series of general obligation bonds of the County (the “Master Bond Ordinance”)
to provide for the payment, inter alia, of certain capital expenditures in and for the County; and

ITEM #17 cont’d
WHEREAS, in order to assist state and local governments in financing capital projects at lower
borrowing costs and to stimulate the economy and create jobs, on the 17th day of February, 2009, the
Congress of the United States enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the
“Stimulus Act”) which act authorizes, inter alia, the issuance of “build America bonds” for the payment
of capital expenditures; and
WHEREAS, if such bonds meet certain conditions as set forth in the Stimulus Act, “build America
bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of thirty-five percent
(35%) of the interest coming due thereon, thereby affording potential economic benefits to the issuer of
such bonds; and
WHEREAS, on the 2nd day of June, 2009, the Corporate Authorities amended the Master Bond
Ordinance specifically to authorize the issuance of one or more series of the County’s general obligation
bonds as “build America bonds;” and
WHEREAS, on the 18th day of June, 2009, the County entered into a bond purchase agreement for
$251,410,000 Taxable General Obligation Bonds, Series 2009B (Build America - Direct Payment) (the
“Series 2009B Bonds”), which bonds are to be issued on July 7, 2009, and all of which bonds qualify as
“build America bonds” that are eligible for a direct payment to the County by the United States Treasury
of thirty-five percent (35%) of the interest coming due thereon; and
WHEREAS, a bond that qualifies as a “build America bond” under the Stimulus Act may further qualify
to be designated as a “recovery zone economic development bond;” and
WHEREAS, bonds which are designated prior to their issuance by the issuer as “recovery zone economic
development bonds” are eligible for a direct payment by the United States Treasury to the issuer of fortyfive percent (45%) of the interest coming due thereon instead of the thirty-five percent (35%) otherwise
payable; and
WHEREAS, the Stimulus Act also authorizes the issuance of “recovery zone facility bonds,” which are a
new category of exempt facility bonds eligible to be issued as tax exempt bonds under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and which, although they are not eligible for a direct payment by the
United States Treasury to the issuer of an interest subsidy, nevertheless afford certain potential economic
benefits to the issuer of such bonds; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stimulus Act the proceeds of recovery zone economic development bonds
must be used to pay for one or more “qualified economic development purposes” in a “recovery zone”
designated by the issuer, each as defined in the Stimulus Act; and
WHEREAS, “qualified economic development purposes,” as defined in the Stimulus Act, include
expenditures for public infrastructure and construction of public facilities; and
WHEREAS, “recovery zone” is defined in the Stimulus Act as an area (i) having significant poverty,
unemployment, rate of home foreclosures or general distress, (ii) which has been designated by the issuer
as economically distressed by reason of military base closure or realignment pursuant to the Defense Base
Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, or (iii) which had been designated as an empowerment zone or a
renewal community on the date the Stimulus Act was enacted; and
WHEREAS, the Stimulus Act further requires that recovery zone economic development bonds and
recovery zone facility bonds can only be issued by a State or local government pursuant to an allocation
by the Secretary of the Treasury (the “Secretary”) of a portion of a nationwide volume limitation; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities have heretofore, and it hereby expressly is, determined that the
Public Safety Funds Project, the Health Fund Project, the Corporate Fund Project and the Capital
Equipment Project, in each case as approved to date by action of the Corporate Authorities, include
capital expenditures for public infrastructure and construction of public facilities, and therefore said
projects qualify as “qualified economic development purposes” under the Stimulus Act; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities are generally familiar with the conditions now extant in the
County; and

the County and threatens the health, safety, morals and welfare of the public; and
WHEREAS, on the 12th day of June, 2009, the Secretary released Notice 2009-50, which sets forth the
maximum amounts of recovery zone economic development bonds and recovery zone facility bonds that
may be issued by each State, county and large municipality under the Stimulus Act; and
WHEREAS, the Secretary has awarded the County an allocation of $131,209,000 for recovery zone
economic development bonds (being the “Recovery Zone Economic Development Bond Allocation”) and
an allocation of $196,814,000 for recovery zone facility bonds; and

issue recovery zone economic development bonds and recovery zone facility bonds is scheduled to expire
on December 31, 2010; and

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 17, 2009 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $20,000.00, Purchase Order No. 167209
with Design Installation Systems, Inc., Morton Grove, Illinois, for the Countywide Exterior Wall

$140,606.25

During the repair of the emergency areas it was determined that there were other imminently
hazardous conditions that required stabilization. This increase provides for the removal and
stabilization of loose terra cotta coping on the northwest corner parapet and the north facade.
This project is categorized as an emergency exterior wall renovation project.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $20,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
This project was included in the 2009 Capital Improvement Program projects approved by the Board of
Commissioners on April 2, 2009.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
PROPOSED CHANGE ORDER
ITEM #29
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON CONSTRUCTION #301498
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 8, 2009 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 1 in the amount of $2,515,950.00 to the
contract with Roula Associates Architects, Chicago, Illinois, Architect for the New Residential Treatment
Unit (RTU) and Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RCDC) Project at the Department of
Corrections. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

During the programming phase, it was determined that the using agencies required additional
square footage to meet their needs and to address specific requirements of the
U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) report on conditions at Cook County Jail. In response to
that report, modifications were made to the original program. This will require a significantly
increased design effort on the part of the Architectural and Engineering (A/E) team.
Additional program elements and space are required, which translates into additional project
costs. Some of these program requirements include increased hardening of the facility,
additional security glazing to increase visual supervision, body scanners to reduce strip
searches, and the inclusion of a pneumatic tube system to improve efficiency of medication
delivery.
In addition, the original site had to be changed so that the new building would be adjacent to
Cermak Health Services of Cook County. This will decrease detainee transport distance to
assigned divisions, allow for reduced redundancy in the new building and better staff
efficiency. Surveys of the new site confirmed additional underground utilities, which must be
relocated and will require additional design effort. Also, due to the proximity of the new site
to existing buildings, increased construction phasing and protection of adjacent foundations
must be designed.
The overall project budget was increased during the Capital Improvement Program hearings
and the A/E fee adjustment is recommended due to that increase.
This is categorized as a Public Safety Capital Project.
