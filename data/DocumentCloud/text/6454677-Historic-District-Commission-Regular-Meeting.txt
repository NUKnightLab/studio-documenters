STAFF REPORT 10-09-2019 REGULAR MEETING
PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6450
ADDRESS: 14655 ROSEMONT AVENUE
HISTORIC DISTRICT: ROSEDALE PARK
APPLICANT: FRANK MASTROIANNI, ITALY AMERICAN CONSTRUCTION
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 09-09-2019
STAFF SITE VISIT: 09-25-2019
SCOPE: DEMOLISH EXISTING GARAGE, CONSTRUCT NEW GARAGE
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 14655 Rosemont Avenue is a 2-story single-family residence constructed in 1931. The house
is clad in variegated red brick and features cast stone, terra cotta, and brick detailing. The asymmetrical façade
includes a raised concrete platform which is accessed via two steps located at the center of the elevation. The main
entrance to the house is located in the left side of the elevation. Some of the original leaded glass and wood windows
are present, however, many of them have been replaced with vinyl. The side-gabled roof is covered with light gray
asphalt shingles. Located at the southwest corner of the intersection of Rosemont Avenue and Eaton Avenue, the side
and rear yards are visible from the right-of-way. A garage is located in the rear yard and is accessed off of Eaton
Avenue. A recent fire has left the garage severely damaged.

PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to demolish the existing garage and
construct a new garage in the same location per the attached drawings and application. Included in the proposal
are the following scope items:
• Demolish existing fire-damaged garage in its entirety
• Existing concrete slab and driveway to remain
• Erect new wood-frame garage on existing concrete slab. Specifications for the new garage are as follows:
o 20’ x 20’ wood frame structure to be clad in vinyl siding with aluminum trim (Color: White)
o Gable roof to overhang 2’ above garage door and will be covered in asphalt shingles (Color:
Georgetown Gray)
o 16’ x 7’ embossed steel overhead garage door (Color: Colonial White) to be centered on the north
(Eaton Avenue side) façade
o Person door will be located at the north end of the east façade
o No exterior lighting proposed

 STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
• The garage is visible from the right-of-way and, due to the fire damage, no longer contributes to the historic
character of the property
ISSUES
• The proposal for the new garage includes vinyl siding. Vinyl is not considered an appropriate material
within historic districts.
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that demolition of the garage and construction of a new garage, as proposed, does not destroy
historic materials that characterize the historic character of the property. Staff therefore recommends that the
Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the demolition of the existing garage and construction of a new
garage as proposed as it meets the following Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in
the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
However, staff recommends that the Commission issue this Certificate of Appropriateness with the following
condition:
• The siding at the new garage be a painted lapped wood or Hardie board siding rather than vinyl.

(d)

The elements of design, as defined in Section 21-2-2 of this Code, are as follows:
(1)

Height. The height of the single-family residential structures in the Rosedale Park Historic District range
from one story to 2½ stories tall, the half-stories contained within the roof. The standards, as defined in
original deed restrictions, shall be met by new single-family residences. Additions to existing buildings
shall be related to the existing structure. Garages are generally one-story tall. The three apartment
buildings on West Outer Drive near Grand River Avenue are two-stories tall on a high basement. The red
brick church on Fenkell at Stahelin has a slightly vaulted sanctuary section that is nearly three stories in
height and two single-story wings.

(2)

Proportion of buildings' front façades. The typical front façades of residential buildings in the Rosedale
Park Historic District are often wider than tall or as wide as tall to their eaves. Tall half-stories with
dormers provide additional height.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the façade. Proportion of openings varies greatly according to the style of
the building. Typical openings are taller than wide, but individual windows are often grouped together to
fill a single opening which is wider than tall. Windows are often subdivided; buildings designed in English
Revival styles frequently display leaded glass in casement windows and transoms. In buildings derived
from classical precedents, double-hung sash windows are further subdivided by muntins. A variety of
arched openings and bay windows exist throughout the district. Modernistic-style residential buildings
have large openings with a variety of proportional relationships. Dormers projecting from the front roof
slopes of many houses in the district add to the window area. Openings range from 20 percent to 75
percent of the front façades, most falling into the 25 percent to 35 percent range.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front façades. In buildings derived from Classical precedents, voids are
usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly spaced manner within the façades. In buildings of other
styles, particularly those of English Revival substyles, voids are arranged with more freedom, but usually
result in balanced compositions. Voids often dominate the design of the front façades of modernistic
style houses.

 (5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally determined by the lot siz
setbacks from side lot lines. There is a general regularity in the widths of subdivision lots from one block to
shared rhythm and cadence along the streetscapes. Generally, all residences or parts thereof, including corn
pergolas and porches, are not nearer than three feet to the side lot line, or as defined by specific subdivision
restrictions.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Entrance and porch types usually relate to the style of the
building. Generally, entrances and porches on buildings of English Revival precedents exhibit freedom of
placement and orientation, while buildings of Classical inspiration typically have porches and entrances
centered on the front façade. A common entry arrangement on vernacular English Revival houses is that
of a slightly projecting, steeply-gabled vestibule or gabled wall punctured with an arched opening. On
smaller-scaled buildings of later building styles, such as the Garrison Colonials, minimalist traditionals
and ranches, entrances and porches are positioned on one side of the front façade. Some houses have
entrances that recede while others have porches, steps, and/or entrances that project. Most porches
occupy a single bay while others, particularly on Arts-and-Crafts and Bungalow style houses, span the
length of the front façade. Side and rear secondary entrances and porches, and enclosed sunrooms, are
common. A rhythm of entrances and porches is not discerned due to the variety of house designs in the
district.

(7)

Relationship of materials. Masonry is the most significant material in the majority of houses in the
Rosedale Park Historic District in the form of pressed or wire cut brick, often combined with wood, stone,
and/or stucco. Wood is almost universally used for window frames, half-timbering, and other functional
trim. Windows are commonly either of the metal casement or wooden sash variety. Aluminum siding and
aluminum canted windows on later buildings are sometimes original; vinyl siding and vinyl windows,
where they exist, are replacements. Glass block exists as an original material in some window openings
of buildings in "modern" styles. Roofs on the majority of the houses in the Rosedale Park Historic District
are asphalt shingled, while several original slate roofs still exist. Garages, where they are contemporary
with the residential dwelling, often correspond in materials.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The major textural relationship is that of brick laid in mortar, often juxtaposed
with wood or smooth or rough-faced stucco and/or stone elements and trim. Textured brick and brick
laid in patterns creates considerable interest, as does half-timbering, leaded and subdivided windows,
and wood-shingled or horizontally-sided elements. Some Arts and Crafts style buildings have stone as
their major first floor material, providing a rustic, organic appearance, and stucco or wood at second
story level. Slate roofs have particular textural values where they exist; asphalt shingles generally do not.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors, such as red, yellow, brown or buff, dominate in wall surfaces.
Natural stone colors also predominate: where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its natural
state, or is painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural slate colors and asphalt shingles are
predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint colors often relate to style. The buildings derived
from Classical precedents, such as the Neo-Dutch Colonials and Garrison Colonials, generally have
woodwork painted in the white or cream range. English Revival style buildings generally have painted
wood trim and window frames of dark brown, gray, buff, or shades of cream, depending on the main
body color. Half timbering is most frequently stained or painted dark brown. Stained and leaded glass,
where it exists as decoration visible on the front façade, contributes to the artistic interest of the
building. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always
acceptable for a house, and may provide guidance for similar houses. Colors used on garages should
relate to the colors of the main dwelling.

 (10)

Relationship of architectural details. The architectural elements and details of each structure generally relat
Contributing residential buildings, constructed between 1917 and 1955, were designed in styles identified as
Revival, Arts-and-Crafts, Bungalow, Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial Revival, Foursquare, Prairie, French Rena
Garrison Colonial, Minimal Traditional, and International, or hybrids of these styles. Characteristic elements
displayed on vernacular English Revival-influenced dwellings include arched windows and door openings, st
gables, towers, clustered chimneys, and sometimes half-timbering. Classically-derived styles display modest
architectural elements, mostly in wood in the form of columned porches, shutters, cornices, and keystones.
of dormer types (shed, gabled, hipped, round-arched, and wall dormers), complimentary to the style of prebuildings, are very common throughout the district. Porte cocheres and archways adjoining the main body o
architectural interest, where they exist. Modern styles are generally characterized by smooth, relatively una
surfaces, horizontal bands of windows, and simplicity. The bank building at the corner of Grand River Avenu
18203 Ashton was designed in a pared-down Neo-Classical style typical of its period. The red brick church on
Stahelin features a triple set of double doors, stylized cross, and substantial stone piers demarcating its prin
In general, the district is rich in early to mid-20th Century architectural styles.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exists, relating to the style of the dwellings.
Common on English Revival buildings are steeply sloped pitched or hipped roofs with complex
arrangements of secondary roof shapes, including steeply sloped gables, clipped gables, and shed roofs.
These roofs are commonly interrupted by gabled, shed, and multi-sided dormers, and substantial
chimneys which are sometimes clustered. Bungalows feature low-slung, side-facing gable roofs with shed
dormers. Classically-inspired buildings display pitched or hipped roofs with less slope, with or without
dormers. Roofs of houses built later in the period of development of the district, such as those of
modern inspiration, tend to have significantly lower slopes. Flat roofs are not typical, except on porches,
sunrooms, and other small extensions of a primary building with a pitched roof, with the exception of the
International-style building facing Stoepel Park No. 1 at 14901 Minock. Flat roofs, as the main roof of a
primary building, are generally not appropriate in the district.

(12)

Walls of continuity. The common setbacks of houses on straight residential streets create strong visual
walls of continuity. This is augmented by the landscaped features in the public rights-of-way, such as the
traffic islands and tree lawns planted with mature trees.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. Monumental features mark the
entrance to Rosedale Park near Grand River Avenue at Ashton Boulevard and Fenkell with an elaborate
set of brick and stone piers; at Glastonbury with brick piers and masonry globes, bearing a plaque
identifying the area's developers; and at Piedmont, the more modest of the three, with its very squat
brick piers bearing masonry globes. The flat terrain of the area is divided with principal streets oriented
north-south and alternating 80 feet and 100 feet in width, and five east-west streets 50 feet in width. The
district is separated from the Grand River Avenue commercial lots by an alley. The typical treatment of
individual residential properties is that of a dwelling erected on a flat or slightly graded front lawn. The
front lawn area is generally covered with grass turf, subdivided by a straight or curving concrete or brick
walk leading to the front entrance and a single-width side driveway leading to a garage. There is variety in
the landscape treatment of individual properties. Lack of front yard fencing, in all but the western part of
the district, is a result of subdivision restrictions that prevent fences near to the front line of the
properties. Fences are allowed at the rear of buildings. The placement of trees on the tree lawn between
the concrete public sidewalk and masonry curb varies from block to block or street to street. Lots in
Rosedale Park Subdivision No. 4, on Auburn, Minock and Plainview, have no curbs, and feature wide tree
lawns. Replacement trees on the public right-of-way should be characteristic of the area and period.

 Original street lighting standards throughout the district have tall fluted poles with crane's necks and
replacement lanterns. Many have been replaced by tall, modern steel poles. A specific light standard was
designed for Outer Drive, and many still exist.
(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. The curbed landscaped traffic islands in the center of the northsouth streets require that the road curves around them. Minock, Auburn, and Plainview on the western
end of the district do not have the landscaped islands in the public right-of-way, although West Outer
Drive has some wide medians. Public sidewalks line each side of the street and are set back from the
road by a tree-lawn that widens when not opposite a landscaped traffic island. All houses have ample
rear yards as well as front yards. Wider lots in Rosedale Park permitted side drives with garages at the
rear of the lots. Where dwellings are located on corner lots, garages face the side street. Garages, when
original, often correspond in materials to the main body of the dwelling, but are of modest, one-story,
simple box design with single- or double-doors. Some later houses in the western part of the district
were originally built with garages that were integrated into the main body of the dwelling. About half of
the original garages in the district have been removed and/or replaced. Fences of metal, wood, or stone
separate individual properties from the alley behind the Grand River Avenue commercial frontage. While
there are a few hedges between properties in front, hedges and backyard fences are common along the
east-west streets, and backyard fences are common throughout the district. Stoepel Park No. 1, outside
the district's southern and western edge, preserves open space, as does Flintstone Park, outside of the
district at its southeastern edge.

(15)

Scale of façades and façade elements. The Rosedale Park Historic District comprises a single-family
residential neighborhood of moderately scaled dwellings. Houses erected in the 1940s and 1950s are
generally smaller in scale than those built in the earlier phase of development. Three multi-unit
apartment buildings, on the west side of West Outer Drive near Grand River Avenue, are also moderately
scaled. Elements and details within are appropriately scaled, having been determined by the style, size,
and complexity of the individual buildings. Window sash are usually subdivided by muntins and
casement windows are leaded, affecting the apparent scale of the windows within the façades.

(16)

Directional expression of front elevations. The houses in the Rosedale Park Historic District are horizontal
or neutral in directional expression. Large architectural elements within façades are frequently vertical in
directional expression, such as multi-storied projecting gables sections, clustered chimneys, or columns.
The three apartment buildings on West Outer Drive are horizontal in directional expression.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Front yard setbacks are generally consistent on each residential street in
the Rosedale Park Historic District, as prescribed by the deed restrictions, although porches, entrance
arrangements, window projections, and irregular massing result in the appearance of variety.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverages. The lot coverage for single-family dwellings ranges generally from 25
percent to 35 percent, including the garage, whether freestanding or attached.

(19)

Degree of complexity within the façades. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is
typical and appropriate for a given style. Overall, there is a higher degree of complexity in the English
Revival style buildings, where their façades are frequently complicated by gables, bays, irregularly-placed
openings and entrances, and irregular massing, than those of other styles. The façades of Classicallyinspired buildings and modernistic buildings are more straightforward in their arrangement of elements
and details.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. The orientation of buildings is generally toward the north-south streets,
with the exception of the house at 14901 Minock, which faces Stoepel Park No. 1. The primary vistas are
created by the landscaped traffic islands. Because of the standard setbacks and lack of front yard

 fencing, the streetscape appears as an unbroken greenbelt.
(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Front façades of buildings range from completely symmetrical to
asymmetrical, but balanced compositions. English Revival style buildings are irregular in layout and
asymmetrical in appearance. The Classically-inspired buildings are generally symmetrical. The
modernistic buildings are not symmetrical but result in highly-ordered compositions.

(22)

General environmental character. The Rosedale Park Historic District is a solid, fully developed large
residential area of just under 1,600 moderately-scaled single-family dwellings, built-up in the period
between World War I and World War II and complemented with typical examples of compatible houses
from the 1950s. The landscaped features within the public rights-of-way results in a park-like setting.
Located approximately 12 miles from the City's center, the Grand River Avenue commercial strip is to its
north; the surrounding area features several other substantial residential subdivisions, including North
Rosedale Park and Grandmont.
