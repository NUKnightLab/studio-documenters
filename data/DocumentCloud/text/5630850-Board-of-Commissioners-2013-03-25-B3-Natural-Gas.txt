GENERAL BACKGROUND

The Chicago Housing Authority?s current natural gas supply and delivery contract with Integrys
Energy Services will expire on March 31St 2013. CHA manages approximately 21,000 lower-
income public housing units located throughout the City of Chicago. Providing heat and
domestic hot water to these units requires a consistent and reliable supply of large volumes of
natural gas.

Given the anticipated consumption of approximately 22,689,860 therrns of natural gas for
the next twenty-four (24) months, the recommended agreement offers CHA the opportunity to
more advantageously purchase its gas needs on wholesale terms instead of retail, and enables the
CHA to hedge against potential market price ?uctuations through use of multi-tiered price/risk
management options available to the CHA as a wholesale (wellhead) purchaser. The CHA has
utilized wellhead purchasing practices to secure its natural gas supplies for the housing portfolio
at advantageous rates and to manage the risks of market ?uctuations in natural gas costs and
supplies. Continued use of wellhead purchasing is expected to provide further cost savings and
ef?ciencies over the use of retail gas supplies from the local utility.

Based on the foregoing, the Of?ce of Budget Management recommends awarding the natural gas
contract to Constellation NewEnergy Gas Division, LLC for twenty-four (24) months,
commencing on or about April 1, 2013, in an amount not-to-exceed $11,800,000.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

The EVP of Finance concurs with the recommendation to enter into a two (2) year contract with
up to three (3) one-year options with Constellation NewEnergy Gas Division, LLC to supply
natural gas to the CHA.

The CEO/President recommends the approval to enter into a contract with Constellation

NewEnergy - Gas Division, LLC for the supply of natural gas to the CHA for base term of two
(2) years of service in an amount not-to-exceed $11,800,000.00.
