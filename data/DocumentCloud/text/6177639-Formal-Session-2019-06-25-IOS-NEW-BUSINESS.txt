HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Robert Solt, Michigan Ambulatory Surgical Center, and
Anesthesia Services Af?liates COD
Case No: 18-011668-NF
File No: 

On June 17, 2019, a case evaluation panel evaluated the above-captioned lawsuit and awarded
Nine Thousand Dollars and N0/Cents in favor of the plaintiff. The parties have until
July 15, 2019, to either accept or reject the case evaluation. Failure to ?le a written acceptance or
rejection within this period constitutes a rejection.

Based upon our review of the facts and particulars of this lawsuit, which are set forth in a
con?dential memorandum that is being separately hand-delivered to each member of Your
Honorable Body, it is our considered opinion that acceptance of the case evaluation award is in
the best interest of the City ofDetroit.

We, therefore. request authorization to settle this matter in the amount of Nine Thousand Dollars
and NO/Cents and that Your Honorable Body direct the Finance Director to issue a
draft in that amount payable to Michigan Ambulatory Surgical Center and Anesthesia Services
Af?liates and their attorney, Ronald C. Puzio, PUZIO LAW, PC, to be delivered upon receipt of
properly executed Releases and Stipulation and Order of Dismissal entered in Lawsuit No. 18-
011668-NF, approved by the Law Department.

Honorable City Council

Subject: Request to Amend the Of?cial Compensation Schedule

 

Recommendation is submitted to amend the 2018 2020 Of?cial Compensation Schedule
to include the following pay adjustment:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Class Classi?cation Current Salary Recommended Bargaining Step
Code Rate of Pay Unit Code
Min Max Min Max
29-20-31 Senior Public $42,025 $44,863 $37,667 $52,733 7100 
Health Educator 
29-20-21 Public Health $38,663 $40,764 $34,000 $47,600 7100 
Educator 
Request:

The above recommendation is at the request of Angelique Rodriguez-Edge from the Health Department.

Rationale:

The above request and recommendation is based on the ability to attract and retain essential personnel to
staff the Ryan White Program of the Health Department.

The SEMHA federal contract is due to end June 30, 2019. It has been determined that it is in the City?s best
interest that the Ryan White Program be moved in-house. The existing classi?ed title of Senior
Public Health Educator has no incumbents and will be reactivated to accommodate the transfer of staff
performing this work. This transition is necessary to ensure that the program is more cost effective,
operates more ef?ciently, and adheres to regulatory guidelines.

To determine the appropriate salary range for the classi?cation, a market study was conducted using data from
external survey sources. The proposed salary is essential for recruitment and retention purposes and is based
on the City of Detroit?s ability to fund the increase. The proposed salary recommendation is subject to City
Council approval.

ReSpectfully submitted,

Denise Starr
Human Resources Director

RE: Resolution Commemorating 100 Years of Women?s Right to Vote

 

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the 19?? amendment and women?s constitutional right to
vote. On June 10, 1919 the State of Michigan rati?ed the 19th amendment. It is important that we
celebrate and commemorate this event. It is equally important that we continue to advocate for
equal access to the ballot box. Therefore, I am requesting that a resolution be drafted
commemorating the 100?? anniversary of the rati?cation of the 19th amendment by the State of
Michigan.

Thank you.
