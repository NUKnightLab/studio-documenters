22· · · ·MR. FLORES:· Thank you, president Foreman.
23· · · · · · ·Pursuant to Section 2-7-8-130 of the

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois· (312) 263-0052

YVer1f

 ·1· ·on which the Chief Administrator of the Civilian
·2· ·Office of Police Accountability and the
·3· ·Superintendent of Police did not agree regarding
·4· ·the discipline of a police officer.
·5· · · · · · · A Request for Review number 18 RR 07
·6· ·involves an allegation that Police Officer Erick
·7· ·Grady failed to allow a reasonable time after
·8· ·"knock and announce" before making forcible entry
·9· ·into a residence.
10· · · · · · ·The Chief Administrator recommended
11· ·sustaining this allegation and that the Officer
12· ·received additional training.· The Superintendent
13· ·recommended classifying this allegations as
14· ·"Unfounded."
15· · · · · · · After reviewing this matter, I find that
16· ·the Superintendent did not meet the burden of
17· ·overcoming the Chief Administrator's recommendation
18· ·for discipline.· Therefore, according to the
19· ·Municipal Code of Chicago, the Chief
20· ·Administrator's recommendation shall be deemed
21· ·accepted by the Superintendent.
22· · · · · · · A copy of the written opinion will be
23· ·posted on the Board's website as required by the
24· ·Municipal Code.

·5· ·new hearing officer.· We received 23 applications
·6· ·and conducted two rounds of interviews of the top
·7· ·candidates.
·8· · · · · · ·Is there a motion to designate Lauren
·9· ·Freeman as a hearing officer of the Police Board
10· ·pursuant to section 284 030 of the Municipal Code
11· ·of Chicago?
12· · · ·MS. SWEENEY:· So moved.

11· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· Yes, sir, thank you.· And
12· ·I do not have a report, but I am the Deputy Chief

17· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· We have a couple of -- this
18· ·is new for the Board members, for the members of
19· ·the public who typically come, something new that
20· ·we're going to start doing is doing a little
21· ·follow-up on some of the questions that were raised
22· ·last month.
23· · · · · · · So last month Dawn Vitrano spoke about
24· ·the death of her daughter and asked several

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.

YVer1f

 ·1· ·questions.· And do you have a follow-up, Deputy
·2· ·Chief Betts?
·3· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· In regards to the
·4· ·requested information, the Superintendent is not
·5· ·here, he is at a funeral.· I'm sure everyone heard
·6· ·about the death of a member of the police.· He's at
·7· ·that service.· But I sure in terms he will be
·8· ·following up with the Chair.
·9· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Okay.· Can you please
10· ·relate to the Superintendent that next month we
11· ·will want to make a public announcement to the
12· ·community on the follow up for that particular
13· ·case.
14· · · · · · · Octavia Michelle requested information
15· ·about an investigation of a police-involved
16· ·shooting of her son and spoke with Chief
17· ·Administrator Roberts.· Do you have any comments on
18· ·that?
19· · · ·MR. CONNOR:· I'll do that now, yes, sir.· Her
20· ·counsel submitted a reformatted request for
21· ·re-opening of the case.· Our office has reached out
22· ·to Ms. Mitchell.· I will be reaching out to her
23· ·attorney now that we understand the request to go
24· ·into it a little further about what, if any, newly

 ·1· ·discovered material is available.· And I will be
·2· ·happy to report back next month on the progress.
·3· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Okay.· Thank you.
·4· · · · · · ·And finally, John Perryman and Vickie
·5· ·Alatorre expressed their concerns about shootings
·6· ·in the 11th and 12th police districts.· I spoke
·7· ·with Superintendent Johnson and he informed me that
·8· ·the two commanders as well as himself met with
·9· ·several community members to the satisfaction of
10· ·those community groups.
11· · · · · · ·Before I call on the members of the
12· ·public who signed up in advance, as you know, today
13· ·a Cook County judge acquitted three police officers
14· ·of all the charges alleging that they lied in
15· ·police reports and conspired to cover up the 2014
16· ·police shooting of Laquan McDonald.· The
17· ·disciplinary cases brought against four other
18· ·officers for making false statements relating to
19· ·the shooting remain before the Police Board.

I

20· ·assure you that in considering these case the Board
21· ·will be guided by the values of fairness and
22· ·transparency.
23· · · · · · ·The role of the Police Department is to
24· ·serve as an impartial body to make decisions based

 ·1· ·on evidence presented in a disciplinary hearing.
·2· ·This hearing will be open to the public and
·3· ·scheduled for March 5 through 7.· And upon the
·4· ·conclusion of the hearing the Police Board will
·5· ·take it under consideration.· The Board takes final
·6· ·action on all cases in public at its monthly
·7· ·meetings where each Board member's vote is
·8· ·announced and recorded, and where it's posted on
·9· ·its website its written decisions, which include
10· ·detailed explanations forth reasons for the Board's
11· ·finding.
12· · · · · · ·The Board understands the concerns and
13· ·frustration that people may have about any
14· ·allegations of misconduct.· We will fulfill our
15· ·obligation to decide these cases in an open and
16· ·fair manner.
17· · · · · · · I will now call upon those members of
18· ·the public who signed up in advance to speak.· When
19· ·your name is called, please step to the microphone.
20· ·We ask that you limit your comments to two minutes.
21· · · · · · ·The first speaker is Sharnette Harris.
22· · · ·MS. HARRIS:· Hello.· Good evening.· My name is
23· ·Sharnette Harris.· My concerns is on behalf of my
24· ·brother, Thomas Harris.· He was shot December 20,

 ·1· ·at 43rd and Michigan inside of a friend's
·2· ·apartment.· The alleged shooter is still out here.
·3· ·He is very dangerous.· He has a criminal background
·4· ·of murder, home invasion, and yet still he's still
·5· ·out here somewhere.
·6· · · · · · · So he's alleged shot my brother in his
·7· ·stomach and my brother died the 21st of December.
·8· ·So I've been in contact with Mr. -- Detective
·9· ·Steven Rivera, the case number is JB 561916, who
10· ·has informed me on several occasions within the
11· ·last three weeks that Ms. Thompson whose apartment
12· ·it was, Sonia Thompson's apartment, that' she's
13· ·going to go in front of the grand jury next week.
14· ·She's going to go in front of the grand jury today.
15· · · · · · ·Several witnesses were there having been
16· ·in front of the grand jury as of today.· So I can't
17· ·obtain an incident report.· They told me I can't
18· ·obtain information because the case is still
19· ·ongoing.
20· · · · · · ·I'm just trying to get justice for my
21· ·brother.· He has no violence in his background,
22· ·no -- I just don't understand why this individual
23· ·shot my brother and I need justice for him.· And
24· ·when I call or go down there, I'm getting nowhere.

 ·1· ·And this man, they are aware of his criminal
·2· ·background.· So I feel for my kids' life and her
·3· ·family because he's still at this lady's house who
·4· ·has DCFS children in her house and has a Section 8
·5· ·apartment where a gun was allegedly recovered from
·6· ·there and a shooting took place.· So I feel like
·7· ·nothing is being done as of now.
·8· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.· First, I'm
·9· ·sorry for your loss.
10· · · · · · ·Deputy Chief, is there someone who
11· ·Ms. Harris can speak with?
12· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· Well, if you have lost
13· ·contact with your tech, I can get you back on track
14· ·with them, but it sounds like you are.· But if you
15· ·need more assistance on obtaining reports, to the
16· ·limitations that you can obtain them, we can
17· ·probably have someone from the back approach you
18· ·and fill you in on how you can get the reports that
19· ·you can.
20· · · ·MS. HARRIS:· I'm in contact with Steven Rivera,
21· ·I talk to him yesterday, last night.· He's been
22· ·informing me that they have to go in front of the
23· ·Grand jury.· This happened December 20th.· So they
24· ·still haven't went in front of the grand jury as of

 ·1· ·today.
·2· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Chief Betts, I don't think
·3· ·she's asking for help getting reports.· I wonder if
·4· ·you can have someone senior in the Bureau of
·5· ·Detectives speak with Ms. Harris.
·6· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· Sure.
·7· · · ·MS. SWEENEY:· Have you contacted DCFS regarding
·8· ·the children?
·9· · · ·MS. HARRIS:· DCFS, as well as the Section 8
10· ·need a police report for someone -- they said they
11· ·were sending someone to investigate, so.· But
12· ·Section 8 needs a police report or something.· They
13· ·have not received anything legal.· I called Section
14· ·8 and made a report.
15· · · ·MS. SWEENEY:· And DCFS?
16· · · ·MS. HARRIS:· They said they were going to send
17· ·someone out to investigate.
18· · · ·MS. SWEENEY:· Keep following up.
19· · · ·MS. HARRIS:· Yes, I have.
20· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Thank you.
21· · · · · · ·Next speaker is Octavia Mitchell.
22· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Hi.· Good evening.· Get used to
23· ·this face, it ain't going no place.· This question
24· ·is for the Chief.· I have a question.

 ·1· · · · · · ·Who is responsible for making sure that
·2· ·DNA is tested in a crime scene police shooting?
·3· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· You're getting into
·4· ·forensics?
·5· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Yes, forensics.
·6· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· Well, when you get into
·7· ·forensics you talk to a detective to follow up.· So
·8· ·if you give me specifics on an RD number or case,
·9· ·I'll make sure someone talks to you about how to
10· ·file.
11· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· So you're not able to answer who
12· ·is responsible?
13· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· Who is responsible for the
14· ·process?
15· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· For testing forensics in a
16· ·police-involved shooting?
17· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· Yes.· We sent our evidence
18· ·to an Illinois state lab.
19· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· You send your evidence to the
20· ·state lab?
21· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· Yes, ma'am.
22· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Okay.· So I was told -- an
23· ·officer testified that this evidence, DNA swabs,
24· ·was sent to this Illinois state lab.· I spoke with

McCorkle Litigation Services, Inc.

14
YVer1f

 ·1· ·a manager at Illinois state lab that said that the
·2· ·CPD never sent those swabs.· I see where they were
·3· ·collected and I'm asking for them.· I am the estate
·4· ·of Izeal Jackson and I should be able to receive
·5· ·anything concerning him, anything concerning his
·6· ·death.· And for some reason it just fell off the
·7· ·face of the earth.· The supervisor at Illinois
·8· ·State Department of forensics stated that the CPD
·9· ·never sent it.· I have a report where CPD officer
10· ·was on the stand and said that he submitted these
11· ·swabs and he had no idea why Illinois State Police
12· ·Department did not test them.
13· · · · · · ·So at this point in time there is a
14· ·blaming game.· But I just want my son's DNA and I
15· ·want to know where it's at and who was responsible
16· ·for testing it.
17· · · ·DEPUTY CHIEF BETTS:· I'm sorry for your loss.
18· ·We will try get to you the cause of this
19· ·misinformation.
20· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Ms. Mitchell, Max Caproni
21· ·is over there and he's the executive -- I forgot

·5· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Okay.· Chief Betts, can you
·6· ·make sure that you let the Superintendent know that
·7· ·we will be in contact about this.· And Max will
·8· ·collect enough specifics that we can ask the

10· · · ·MS. MITCHELL:· Okay.· Thank you.
11· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Next speaker, John

13· · · ·MR. CANTANZARA:· MR. CONNOR, you were supposed
14· ·to get some information for me from last month, I
15· ·don't know if you got it yet, about IPRA's

18· · · ·MR. CANTANZARA:· Okay.· Ms. Roberts was

20· ·show up in December here, and you told me that you
21· ·didn't know.

·4· ·Anyway, then I'll just skip it because nobody can
·5· ·give me a straight answer three months running now
·6· · · · · · ·Ms. Delgado, since you're the one who

10· ·three months now.· Did they provide any

13· ·about a case that's in front of us.

16· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· Next question.· Next
17· ·question.
18· · · ·MR. CANTANZARA:· So they can't answer it
19· ·either?· How come no one told me they can't answer
20· ·it.
21· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· You just asked Ms. Delgado.

 ·1· · · ·MR. CANTANZARA:· That's nice.· And you wonder

·8· ·maybe you're the second best guy to ask this
·9· ·question since you're in charge of CAPS and
10· ·community policing.
11· · · · · · ·The Department has made a very strong
12· ·effort to try and right the wrong ship I guess, and
13· ·try and gain the public's confidence.· How can they
14· ·gain the public confidence when they don't have the
15· ·rank and file confidence?· You mean to tell me with
16· ·a straight face, and the Superintendent stood in
17· ·front of the microphones today and said it was okay
18· ·for a police commander to lie to the inspector
19· ·general and that he has empathy that he can bring
20· ·his kid to work and send policemen to go pick him
21· ·up and bring him back and forth and that was okay.

18· ·provide answers to the actual record of activity
19· ·rather than having all these softball lobbers who
20· ·just no one is getting to the bottom of the issues.
21· ·And we still have the same problems that have been

 ·1· ·that was 10:00 o'clock this morning.· This is just
·2· ·outrages, okay.
·3· · · · · · ·The jury needs to see jury instructions
·4· ·in every single trial because the whole purpose of
·5· ·this where they put the Superintendent there is so
·6· ·when this is all in front of juries, juries can be
·7· ·told that there is no Monell claim because the
·8· ·Superintendent is available to take the input and
·9· ·the complaints of the members of the citizenry.
10· ·That is simply -- that is like fraud, it's fraud by
11· ·omission, okay.· It's not justified.
12· · · · · · ·And for him to be -- he went from, you
13· ·know, 12 years ago the Superintendent was here
14· ·every single meeting.· After the Blaine Spencer
15· ·murders, when we had Jude Weise (phonetic) almost

19· ·that was June of 2010 when I first filed a lawsuit
20· ·to get to the bottom of the Blaine and Spencer

23· ·changed the statutes, the Superintendent doesn't

·9· ·particularly with IPRA and the media leaks, and I
10· ·would appreciate if that would get looked into.· As
11· ·you know, there wasn't a verdict today.· And I sat
12· ·throughout entire trial, and one of the key issues
13· ·in the trial in my mind and many of my members are
14· ·wondering about is the media leak from IPRA to
15· ·either Craig Futterman or Jamie Calvin, the
16· ·journalist.· There are not supposed to be these
17· ·kind of media leaks of a witness in the case.
18· · · · · · ·And apparently this journalist went to
19· ·this witness's house and interviewed him.· And from
20· ·what I understand from the trial, IPRA never even
21· ·notified the investigating detectives that this
22· ·witness existed so they never even interviewed him.
23· · · · · · ·I don't understand how the civilian
24· ·oversight agency can become aware of a witness in a

·3· · · · · · · And I've been up here before and I've

·5· ·illegal leaks to the media.· In fact, I think it
·6· ·was being -- excuse me.· Yeah, we had beefs with
·7· ·IPRA and with COPA.· We filed a complaint about him
·8· ·with the Inspector General.
·9· · · ·MR. CONNOR:· That is your recourse.· If you
10· ·have a complaint, you contact the Inspector
11· ·General.
12· · · ·MR. FREED:· Yes.· We would like these to be
13· ·investigated.· We would like to know who made the
14· ·leaks and why, and why they haven't been -- and
15· ·what kind of punishment they're going to get.
16· · · ·MR. CONNOR:· That's a question for the
17· ·Inspector General.
18· · · ·MR. FREED:· Well, sir, if you're a top leader
19· ·at COPA you should be concerned if there is illegal
20· ·media leaks.
21· · · ·MR. CONNOR:· It didn't happen under COPA, sir.

11· ·to stop and we would like them to be investigated.
12· ·The only media leaks that come out of either IPRA

15· ·COPA hiring outside investigators, in the Rialmo
