Re:  

 

Final Update: 2017 Wholesale Water Contract Reopeners 

Background:  The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) model water contract provides for 
designated reopener dates in year 2, year 5 and every 5 years afterwards, until the end of 
the 30‐year term of the contract. As part of the reopener process, each customer can 
discuss its maximum day and peak hour demands, which are included in Exhibit B of the 
contract, and negotiate those values based on historical performance and projected 
changes in its usage. The maximum day and peak hour demands in the model contract are 
used in the determination of customer charges and represent about ninety percent (90%) 
of the annual revenue requirement for each customer. 
Analysis: Between October 9, 2017and December 13, 2017, the negotiations team met 
with 29 of the 30 scheduled reopeners plus one out‐of‐sequence reopener (Commerce 
Township).  As of January 12, 2018, 30 contract amendments have been drafted and sent to 
the customer and all 30 amendments have been approved by the customer’s legislative 
body by the January 12, 2018 deadline.  The next step in the process is for the GLWA Board 
of Directors to approve the contract amendments at its January 24, 2018 meeting. Below is 
a summary of the changes to the contracts, based on the amended contract values. 
Reopener results as compared to FY 2018 demand values: 
 22 customers decreased contract demands 
 5 customers increased contract demands 
 4 customers had no change in contract demands 
Net Change in reopeners for FY 2019 contract demands vs FY 2018 contract demands:

Re:

Update on Cost of Service Studies for FY 2019 Charges - The Foster Group

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer

Background: Each January, the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) members receive a
calculation of the Cost of Service Studies and the resulting proposed charges. This timing is
defined by service contracts as further cited in the attached budget calendar.
Analysis: GLWA’s advisor, The Foster Group, prepares the Cost of Service Studies and
charges based upon several inputs and analysis. Bart Foster, The Foster Group, will be in
attendance at the Audit Committee meeting to address the status of the Cost of Service
study and charge development as well as unique considerations in the development of the
FY 2019 charges. Presentation materials are attached.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

(A) thru (D) - The above schedule is designed to meet applicable statutory and contractual
requirements with excerpts shown below.

A. Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act, Act 2 of 1968, Section 141.434, “Before
final passage of a general appropriations act by the legislative body, a public hearing
shall be held as required by 1963 (2nd Ex Sess) PA 43, MCL 141.411 to 141.415, and

Draft 1.16.2018

Binder 1
Page 8

 the open meetings act, 1976 PA 267, MCL 15.261 to 15.275.” (For purposes of
Public Act 2, the GLWA Board is the legislative body.)
B. Budget Hearings of Local Governments, Act 43 of 1963 (2nd Ex. Sess.), Section
141.412, “The local unit shall give notice of the hearing by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation within the local unit at least 6 days before the
hearing.” (For purposes of Public Act 2, the GLWA Board is a local unit.)
C. Home Rule City Act, Act 279 of 1909, Section 117.5e, “Municipal water or sewage
system; annual audit; public hearing before proposed rate increase. A municipal
water or sewage system established by a city incorporated under this act which
serves more than 40% of the population of the state shall: ….(b) Hold at least 1
public hearing at least 120 days before a proposed rate increase is scheduled to take
effect. Each hearing shall be conducted in compliance with Act No. 267 of the Public
Acts of 1976, being sections 15.261 to 15.275 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.
Notice of the time, date, and place of each hearing shall be given in the manner
required by Act No. 267 of the Public Acts of 1976, shall be prominently printed in a
daily newspaper of general circulation within the area, and shall be mailed to each
city, village, or township served by the system not less than 30 days before each
hearing. A final vote by the governing body of the city to implement a proposed rate
increase shall not be taken until the hearings provided for in this subdivision are
concluded and the results of those hearings are considered by the city's governing
body.” (Emphasis added)
It should be noted that the Home Rule City Act does not apply to GLWA. It is
relevant to GLWA’s planning cycle, however, as it is referenced in the Wholesale
Customer Model Water Contract as noted below.
D. GLWA Wholesale Customer Model Water Contract Section 7.02 provides:
“Notification of Rates. As soon as possible in the ratemaking process, the Board
shall provide information on proposed rates and the draft data and information
used in the calculation of proposed rates in a format that will enable Customer to
assist in the ratemaking process. Not less than thirty calendar days prior to the
hearing required by Act 279, the Board shall provide Customer with written notice
of a proposed rate and the underlying data used to calculate the rate. The Board
shall meet with Customer to review the rate and the data.” (Emphasis added; Act
279 is the Home Rule City Act noted above.)

Presentation Premise

• The material in this presentation has been prepared
to provide updates to specific focus areas for the FY
2019 Charges, as set forth in our January 4
memorandum.
• Many of the elements are in near final state, others
remain under review, including:
 Capital Improvement Programs for both GLWA and DWSD
 The portion of the Sewer O&M Budget allocable to:
 CSO programs – under review by GLWA and DWSD
representatives
 OMID specific facilities - also under GLWA review
 The IWC program - also under GLWA review

These preliminary projections are impacted by
the level of capital investment required by both
the Regional GLWA and Local DWSD System.
Final CIP plans for both entities remain under
development.

Operating Expense Budget:

Administrative and Centralized Services

• The FY 2018 Charges were based on an assumption
that 45% of the operating expenses for
Administrative and Centralized Services (in total)
were allocable to Water and 55% to Sewer.
 The existing Charges were developed based on the
preliminary FY 2018 Budget Request
 Subsequent developments have modified the relative split
for actual costs to ~ 43% / 57% (in total)

• The PRELIMINARY cost allocation plan indicates
that approximately 54% should be Water and 46%
Sewer.
 Different ratios for Centralized and Administrative
Services

Operating Expense Budget:

Administrative and Centralized Services

• The PRELIMINARY cost allocation plan is
based on a review of a limited data set
• The intent is to continue evaluation as
additional data becomes available
• The FY 2019 allocation plan represents a
first step, towards this allocation strategy,
recognizing that the “end state” may change
as a result of ongoing evaluations

Operating Expense Budget:

Administrative and Centralized Services

• The FY 2019 Implementation Plan uses a universal
allocation factor of 46% Water / 54% Sewer for
both Administrative and Centralized Services
• With respect to Charges, this will shift
approximately $1.3 million of operating expenses
from Sewer to Water
• Important to recognize that this impact is not
directly meaningful without evaluating the entirely
of the budget impacts
 Both BUDGETs include a 2.0% increase, irrespective of
any specific allocation of the elements that make up the
budgets

Water Cost of Service Allocations:

Impact of GCDC’s Customer status change
• GCDC’s status change from full service to reciprocal
backup service will create a $3.7 million negative
revenue variance in the FY 2019 Budget
• Anticipated revenue from Flint is somewhat lower
than FY 2018, which accentuates this challenge
• However, projected sales revenue for other
Customers reflects a minor increase, as does
projected non-operating revenue
• Net impact is a negative revenue variance of $2.2
million must be met from increased service charges
to Customers, even without a BUDGET increase

Water Units of Service: Impact of UoS

Study for non master metered Customers

• The Preliminary FY 2019 Cost of Service
Allocations incorporate the results of the Black
& Veatch Study, and the GLWA Administrative
Implementation recommendation, which:
Increases max day and peak hour demands for
Detroit and Highland Park by 10% - similar to the
approach applied to model contract Customers who
re-opened during 2017
Increases Dearborn’s max day and peak hour
demands by 20% - consistent with the manner that
demands for other Customers under “old” contract
formats are treated

Water Units of Service: Impact of

Customer “Re-Opener” Demand Changes

• Recognition of updated customer demands
from the contract re-openers will result in a
cost allocation shift
• All else being equal, adjustments to
contract demands would re-allocate
approximately $5.9 million in annual
revenue requirements from Re-opener
Customers to all other Customers

Water Cost of Service Allocations:

Treatment of Flint & Highland Park

• Flint and Highland Park will initially be
allocated cost of service in the same manner
as all other Customers
• Subsequently, two adjustments will be
required to reflect:

The credit to Flint associated with KWA Debt Service;
The expected collection rate for Highland Park
 We are currently continuing to assume no collections of
bills issued to Highland Park for Water service

• These adjustments are similar to that made for
Detroit’s “Ownership Benefit”

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee 

From:  Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager 
Re:  

 

Annual Update & Financing Strategy with PFM (Part 1 of 2) 

Background:  Every January the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) receives an annual 
market and financing opportunity update from its financial advisor, PFM Financial Advisors 
(PFM).   
This year, this update will span two meetings.  The first meeting on January 19, 2018 will 
address recent changes in laws that affect municipal finance and current market conditions 
and possible refunding opportunities.  At the February Audit Committee meeting on 
February 16, 2018, PFM will present Part 2 of the Annual Update & Financing Strategy with 
a benchmarking analysis and a review of GLWA’s financial metrics. 
Analysis: PFM Financial Advisors (PFM) has provided an analysis of potential water and 
sewer bond refunding opportunities as well as updates to the current municipal bond 
market conditions and the effects of the federal tax bill that was signed on December 22, 
2017. (See attached presentation.) 
Based on current market conditions, PFM has identified possible refunding candidates of 
$161.4 million of senior lien sewer bonds and $178.7 million of second lien water bonds 
which are callable on July 1, 2018.  The estimated net present value (NPV) savings are 
currently $31.9 million (17.1%) for sewer and $30.3 million (14.5%) for water, over the 
remaining life of the respective bond issues.   
Budget Impact:  Based on the draft FY 2019 and FY 2020 biennial budget and five‐year 
financial plan which was presented to the Board at its meeting on January 10, 2018, no 
potential refunding savings were included in the projected debt service. If GLWA is 
successful in pricing the refunding bonds at the rates and assumptions presented in the 
PFM analysis, the sewer system could see an average annual savings of about $2.8 million 
and the water system could see an average annual savings of about $2.7 million over the 
remaining term of the original bonds. 
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

 Major impact of bill for GLWA is the prohibition on tax-exempt advance refunding bonds after

December 31, 2017
• Under prior law, each issue of tax-exempt bonds could be advance refunded one time on a taxexempt basis
• Tax-exempt status of current refunding bonds (closing within 90 days of call date on refunded

 Bond Sale Strategy Not Altered in the Wake of Tax Reform
 While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is adverse to GLWA via eliminating advance refundings, this development should not drive

a different financing strategy than what has been contemplated by GLWA
 The bulk of the refinancing candidates on both the water and sewer credits are tax-exempt current refundings

• Significant debt service savings will remain available on both credits, with ability to accelerate a portion of the savings
• Additional series will become current refunding candidates in 2019 and 2021
 New money transactions are not impacted for GLWA
 Majority of savings in the universe of refinancing candidates are generated by bonds that will be currently callable by April

2018
• Could also structure the refinancing today to accelerate savings and build in expectation of future current refunding savings
after 2020
 Current refundings will be more efficient than advance refundings (no additional escrow cost) and ultimately could afford

more savings than tax-exempt advance refundings that are no longer permissible due to tax reform
• Does involve more interest rate risk for GLWA between now and current refunding date
• GLWA would get the benefit of “moving down the curve” for financing rates, and could always look at taxable advance
refunding options

 Moody’s Water & Sewer Sector Outlook
 Anticipate overall stability in the sector, driven by strong rate management and liquidity
 Annual debt service coverage remains strong and in line with 2016 medians, as utilities have

made proactive adjustments to rates
 Liquidity remains pivotal to the sector’s stability, indicating necessary flexibility to absorb

unanticipated revenue declines or spending increases
• Moody’s expects the current upward trend of cash reserves to continue in the sector and Moody’s
expects the current upward trend of cash reserves to continue in the sector
 Moody’s expects continued reliance on debt issuance for non-routine capital spending, as liquidity

levels are insufficient to fund major capital requirements
 In 2018 and beyond, finding the right balance between capital investment, financial stability, and

rate affordability will be key to sector credit quality
 While Moody’s does not expect asset condition to worsen dramatically during the next 12-18

months, sufficiency of system investment is becoming an increasingly important sector trend as
median asset useful life continues to decline

 Fitch’s Water & Sewer Sector Outlook
 Stable outlook, with the key factors in the sector’s performance stability being essentiality of the

services, monopolistic nature, and generally autonomous rate-setting authority
 Planned ongoing moderate rate adjustments should maintain consistent results through 2018, although

headwinds from stagnant sales and rising costs are evident
 Fitch anticipates flat capital spending in 2018 which is favorable for debt metrics, but offset by concern

over the increasing age of facilities (which are at their oldest in 15 years of Fitch tracking median data)
 Rates remain affordable but increases have outpaced inflation for many years, leaving diminished

capacity
 Utilities face challenges in fully recovering capital replacement costs stemming from rate structures that

traditionally generate the bulk of revenues from customer usage despite the vast majority of costs being
fixed
 Sector cash reserves should continue to increase through 2018 and continue providing utilities flexibility

in meeting operating and capital pressures
 Risk associated with uncertainty with environmental regulations, particularly related to the Lead and

Copper Rule

 DWSD Retail Billings:  Table 1 shows the FY 2018 sewer billed usage and billed revenue 
which are provided by DWSD staff.  As of December 31, 2017, the DWSD usage was at 
98.79% of budget and billed revenue was at 101.13% of budget. 
GLWA Wholesale Customer Billings:  Table 1 shows the FY 2018 sewer billed revenue. 
As a result of the sewer rate simplification which provides a more stable revenue stream, 
the wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee. The results of this effort can 
be seen as the billed revenue is at 100.0% of budget through December 31, 2017.  
Total System Billings:  Table 1 shows the FY 2018 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale 
sewer billed usage and billed revenue. Based on the combined billings, the GLWA Sewer 
System had billed revenues of 100.57% of budget based upon the most current information 
available as of this report. 
2. FY 2018 Retail and Wholesale Water Revenue Report

 4. City of Flint Billings and Collections   
On October 16, 2015, the City of Flint (“City”) re‐joined the regional water system pursuant 
to a short‐term agreement which was extended several times through November 30, 2017.  
That agreement provided for a prepayment fund.  In total, GLWA has received over $28.4 
million to the prepayment fund, and as of December 31, 2017, $126,130.35 remains in the 
prepayment fund as shown in Table 4.  
Beginning December 1, 2017, GLWA is now providing water service to Flint in accordance 
with a new 30‐year water service agreement.  The terms of this agreement provide for the 
funding of a $3,750,000 Security Deposit account by the City of Flint, which was received by 
GLWA on January 11, 2018.  The Security Deposit Account may only be drawn down if Flint 
fails to make full and timely payments. The agreement also provides for a monthly credit to 
Flint for its previous month’s debt service payment to KWA and a pass‐through charge to 
Flint for monthly service provided by GCDC.  All monthly payments by Flint will be 
deposited with the Trustee, US Bank GLWA, KWA and GCDC per the provisions of the 
Baseline Trust.

Re:

Update: FY 2019 – FY 2020 Biennial Budget and FY 2019 – 2023 Financial Plan

From: Nicolette Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer

Background: On January 5, 2018 the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) was presented
with discussion draft materials for the FY 2019 – FY 2020 Biennial Budget and FY 2019 –
2023 Financial Plan. Subsequently the draft budget was presented to the GLWA Board at
its meeting on January 10, 2018. A combination of materials from both of those meetings
was presented at the Customer Outreach meeting on January 11, 2018.

Analysis: Additional information was requested at the Audit Committee meeting on
January 5, 2018, of which many items were subsequently presented at the Board meeting
on January 10, 2018. Additional items were requested on January 10, 2018 that could not
be compiled in time for today’s meeting on January 19, 2018 due to a number of conflicting
priorities and circumstances. Those supplemental materials will be distributed next week.
A significant element in finalizing the biennial budget and five-year financial plan is
incorporating the proposed FY 2019 to FY 2023 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). GLWA
staff has been diligently revising the CIP to align with a new level of performance as we
enter GLWA’s third year of operations. It is expected that a revised annual spending level
and related sub-categories of spending will be submitted early next week for the Financial
Planning & Analysis team and myself to update and review the overall financial plan.

Given the timing to revise the financial plan and the capital improvement plan, receive
feedback from Audit Committee, Capital Improvement Planning Committee, full Board
feedback, other stakeholder feedback as well as to compile and/or update the related
documents and plans, staff respectfully requests the Audit Committee considers moving the
February 16, 2018 Audit Committee meeting to February 9, 2018 to allow for adequate
Board review while keeping to a preferred adoption date of February 28, 2018. A possible
flow of activities is outlined in the table below.

Re:

Analysis of Retail and DWSD Receivable as of June 30, 2017

From: Kim Garland, Management Professional – Public Finance

Background: On the effective date of the regional water and sewer system leases for the
Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA), certain assets and liabilities of the Detroit Water &
Sewerage Department (DWSD) transferred to the GLWA. The assets included the retail
system accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 which were recorded in the financial
records of the GLWA (“Assumed Retail Accounts Receivable”). Subsequent retail system
customer billings and receivables for services provided in the month of January 2016 and
after are recorded in the financial records of the DWSD in accordance with the terms of the
leases.

Beginning January 2016, water and sewer system services are provided by GLWA to the
City of Detroit through the DWSD. Accordingly, DWSD is allocated a revenue requirement
for those regional system services in accordance with a services agreement. Consistent
with the terms of the GLWA Master Bond Ordinance, which is applicable to assumed preand new post-bifurcation debt of the DWSD which transferred to GLWA on the effective
date, the cash receipts of both DWSD and GLWA are deposited in a Trust Estate and
distributed in accordance with the terms of the Master Bond Ordinance (MBO). Those cash
receipts are then distributed in accordance with the MBO in accordance with a defined flow
of funds for both GLWA (the “Regional System”) and DWSD (the “Local System”) for their
respective financial commitments (“MBO Requirements”) including operations &
maintenance funs, debt service, legacy pension, water residential assistance program,
budget stabilization fund, improvement & extension fund, and reserves.
The complexity of the accounting, reconcilement, and coordination of these transactions is
significant. The staff of both GLWA and DWSD work together to coordinate these activities.
As both entities near the completion of their respective FY 2017 year-end close and related
audit fieldwork, the financial impact of the nature of the transaction and related cash flows
results in a cumulative receivable from DWSD as shown on the attached analysis. The
analysis provides the status of retail cash receipts applied to the a) assumed retail accounts
receivable on January 1, 2016 and b) Regional System service charges billed and credited

 through June 30, 2017 as recorded on the books of the GLWA. While the nature of the two
activities are distinct, both are linked to the same cash collections and were subject to
business judgement on how to best appropriately apply the cash receipts.
Analysis: Key points related to these two activities is noted below.

Assumed Retail Accounts Receivable: The January 1, 2016 Assumed Retail Accounts
Receivable (AR) includes all related activities and account balances including: Retail AR,
Allowance for Retail AR, Wayne County (“County”) Revolving Fund Loan and related AR
and Allowance, City General and Tax Fund balances related to County Revolving Fund,
Customer Deposits, and Detroit Residential Water Assistance Program.

1. It should be noted that, in October 2017, the City of Detroit (“City”) transferred
$16,851,450 to GLWA consisting of retail receipts and a County Revolving Fund
settlement for property tax year 2016 (consisting largely of original billings from
2015 and/or prior). This transfer has further reduced the GLWA December 31,
2015 assumed retail accounts receivable balance presented.

2. The Assumed Retail Accounts Receivable was recorded on January 1, 2016 net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts consistent with prior assumptions of collection
rates. The subsequent cash collections of the Assumed Retail Accounts Receivable
have had a positive variance. Collections exceeded what appears to have now been
conservative allowance reserves as of January 1, 2016 by nearly $31 million.

Regional System Service Charges to DWSD and Local System MBO Requirements: The
following relates to new transactions since January 1, 2016.

1. The attached schedule presents total balances due per the general ledger. This
balance provides a current and non-current portion. The current portion represents
two months of Regional System Service Charges and MBO Requirements which total
$2.6 million for water and $31.2 million for sewer. Bills for Regional System
Services are due 45 days from the bill date. The MBO requirements are considered
due when the monthly transfers are made.
2. There are differences between DWSD and GLWA balances as of June 30, 2017.
These are summarized as follows:

a. Treatment of First Month of MBO Requirements (i.e. January 2016) – DWSD
recorded five months of MBO requirements in fiscal year 2016 instead of six.
GLWA believes that six months of MBO requirements is consistent with the
terms of the lease terms. (Note that the effective date of the leases was
halfway through FY 2016, hence six months of activity.) This difference is
$8.4 million.

 b. Various other differences – DWSD reports $1.28 million less due to variances
related to various collection activities and allocations, such as customer
refunds, bank charges, debt payment variances, and miscellaneous other
retail receipt transactions.

Overall Financial Position: Cumulatively, the retail cash receipts are not sufficient to fund
the Assumed Retail Accounts Receivable and Regional System service charges to DWSD as
well as the Local System MBO Requirements
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Re:

Capital Overhead Cost Allocation Project

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer

Background: The FY 2017 budget for the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) was
prepared in late calendar year 2015 and early calendar year 2016. This spanned GLWA’s
operational effective date of January 1, 2016. GLWA’s financial system was launched in
March 2016. The predecessor entity’s financial system was challenging at best. In
addition, financial staff vacancy approached a 50% mark as staff for one consolidated entity
was now split between two entities at the time of bifurcation.
As we approach the second anniversary of the launch of GLWA’s financial system, basic
functions are running well and we now have one full fiscal year of data for analysis. This
was sorely needed to begin to establish financial patterns and expectations. One area that
was more elusive in the prior system was the accumulation and tracking of internal capital
project time and overhead. Today, while progress has been made, cost allocation (a high
priority need for GLWA) is largely manual via spreadsheets. Tracking time is time
consuming, and worse, untimely, inconsistent, and difficult to implement. In the long-term,
the Information Technology group is evaluating options for tracking time by project.
Aside from the technology and business process issues, we need to formulate an informed
policy related to capital project overhead.
Analysis: There are two aspects of this topic that we want to bring to the Audit
Committee’s attention: 1) Self-constructed Asset Capitalization Policy (under evaluation)
and 2) Impact on FY 2017 Budget.
1) Self-constructed Asset Capitalization Policy: Many public entities, including water
and sewer systems, have capitalization policies with wording akin to the following.

 Self-Constructed Assets: When the entity uses internal staff, resources, equipment,
and/or materials to construct a building or piece of machinery or equipment for its
own use that meets the capitalization dollar criteria, an acquisition cost will be
established and the asset will be recorded as if it had been purchased.
All direct costs, including material and labor costs, will be included in the total cost
of the asset. Overhead (indirect) costs will not be included unless they are
increased by the construction of the asset.

The above policy statement is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles
which references any “ancillary charges necessary to place the asset into its intended
location and condition for use”.

Given the intensive capital nature of GLWA’s operations, the question of indirect overhead
allocations is complex (especially with limited, quality data from our short life) but is also
significant. This is especially true in areas where costs are incurred to provide internal
services that are clearly related to projects, but not to one specific project.

Revolving Fund guidelines address “force account costs” as “direct labor costs, indirect
costs, and other project allocable expenses, such as travel, printing, or postage incurred by
an applicant for administration and technical services are eligible for reimbursement if
such costs are adequately documented, as described in the “Instructions for Completing the
Project Cost Worksheet” (requires detailed project time accounting)”.
There are several considerations in evaluating the indirect overhead allocation.

1. How those costs should be funded. The predecessor entity’s practice was to
optimize the use of debt for capital improvements. That may not be consistent with
GLWA’s long-term financial sustainability objectives.
2. System limitations and the cost/benefit of work-arounds may impact an approach.
3. Implementing business processes and systems to align the CIP cost build-up by
project, by year and the budget for each year.

4. Preventing bloating of the asset cost (and related annual depreciation expense) with
a high percentage of indirect costs.
5. Ensuring that soft costs do not accumulate in construction work-in-progress (CWIP)
that do not materialize into capitalizable assets.

 2) Impact on FY 2017 Budget: As we were closing the books for FY 2017, to varying
degrees, all five of the above considerations led us to a conservative application of
overhead allocation. In hindsight, the original FY 2017 overhead allocation budget may
have been high (even though they were significantly lower than the predecessor entity).
We had no history. Also, as a new entity, our level of capital delivery was lower which may
have overstated asset value if we applied indirect overhead in addition to capitalized
interest on CWIP. And, as a new entity, we simply did not have the people, processes, or
technology in place to develop and manage an effective indirect cost allocation plan.

The result is a material variance in “contra-expenses” of $24.2 million or 92%. It should be
noted however, that a significant portion of this variance is offset by many related expense
categories being under budget. The preliminary FY 2017 overall operations and
maintenance budget is expected to have a positive variance of approximately $32 million,
inclusive of this variance.

Re:

Update: GLWA and DWSD Shared Services True-Up Status

From: Alicia Haskin, Management Professional – Intergovernmental Relations
Background: As a result of the regional water and sewer system implementation, it was
agreed by both Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) and Detroit Water and Sewerage
Department (DWSD) that certain services would be provided by one agency to the other.
These Shared Services were outlined in the Shared Services Agreement (the Agreement) on
December 1, 2015, in order to facilitate and enhance the efficiency of the operation of both
systems, as well as, to avoid duplication of services and functions by both parties.

For the fiscal year June 30, 2016 (FY 2016) there was a monthly invoice for each Shared
Service based on an agreed upon budget, as provided in the Agreement. Per Section 5.1 of
the Agreement, at the end of each fiscal year there is a requirement for a Cost Analysis to be
completed (“True-up”) to determine the actual costs of providing such services compared
to the originally budgeted amounts.
The Shared Service Agreement states that:

“Each invoice, whether for Services provided regularly or “as-needed,” shall itemize
the costs and charges by Services provided under each Service Delivery Schedule,
and shall provide sufficient detail to the Subscribing Party to identify the Services
performed and the basis for the charges. A Performing Party may only charge the
Service Costs for Services provided.” (Section 5.1)

The Shared Services Team for GLWA has diligently reviewed all costs for each service
provided to DWSD in FY 2016. The FY 2016 True-up for each shared service provided by
GLWA has been given to DWSD for analysis.
Analysis: The following is an update of the True-Up process.

 Fiscal Year 2016 Update

The table below lists the status of each Shared Service based upon GLWA’s staff analysis.
Those items with “Outstanding Issue” will be further discussed below. As of the last
meeting on January 12, 2018 between the GLWA and DWSD Shared Services Teams, there
was no known issues identified by DWSD with the true-up materials submitted by GLWA
for the items identified as “Resolved.”

There is one major outstanding issues for FY 2017 True Up. This is the clarification needed
for the allocation for OPS-008 – Systems Control. This issue is left over from the FY 2016
outstanding issues. When the meeting between management occurs and if an agreement
can be reached for the allocation than FY 2017 True-up of OPS-008 will be calculated.

Next Steps FY 2017: The GLWA and DWSD Shared Services Teams will continue to meet
to discuss any open issues for FY 2017. Once all Shared Services True-Ups are complete the
information will be shared with the other party for review.
Per Section 5.1 of the Agreement the parties shall engage, and share the costs of, a thirdparty to analyze the actual Service Costs. This is a requirement for each fiscal year. This
will be the final step to complete the FY 2017 True-Up.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.
