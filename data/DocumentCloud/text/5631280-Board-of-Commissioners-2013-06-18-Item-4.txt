 GENERAL BACKGROUND
CHA operates and maintains computer labs in senior and family buildings and community buildings
throughout its housing portfolio that assist in bridging the technology gap that exists in many low
income communities. Currently, there are eight (8) fully operational labs that will be supported through
this initiative and two (2) additional labs scheduled to be completed by July. The proposed program
will provide: 1) oversight and supervision during lab hours; 2) maintenance of CHA computer lab
equipment; and 3) coordination of a menu of programming for CHA residents. Additionally, the
program will provide intensive technology, customer services and workforce development training to
CHA residents and assistance in placing successful completers in employment opportunities both in the
CHA labs and within the technology industry.
For more than 20 years, TEC Services has provided education and technology solutions for a large
client base, including multiple public and governmental agencies. Since 2008 TEC Services has served
as a partner in CHA’s workforce development initiatives, first through the Resident Opportunity for
Self Sufficiency (“ROSS”) grant from HUD and then through the Broadband Technology Opportunities
Program (“BTOP”). Through these programs, TEC Services has trained and/or employed hundreds of
CHA residents. TEC Services will utilize the relationships it has created over the past five (5) years to
continue to provide high quality and customized education and technology services for CHA residents.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
The EVP of Resident Services concurs with the recommendation to enter into a contract with TEC
Services to provide oversight, maintenance and program coordination at CHA computer labs.
