ESTABLISHING THE COOK COUNTY COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE
TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN OUTREACH STRATEGY FOR THE 2020 CENSUS
WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States requires an enumeration of the population every 10 years
to apportion congressional representation among the states; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 141 of Title 13 of the United States Code, the next federal decennial
census of the population will be taken on the first day of April in 2020; and
WHEREAS, the United States Census Bureau will endeavor to count every person in the nation, and many
states and counties are establishing programs and initiatives to promote the census; and
WHEREAS, a complete and accurate count of the population is essential to the fair and proper allocation
of federal funds towards social service programs, influences the planning and development of highways,
hospitals, and businesses, and has a direct bearing on electoral representation and redistricting; and
WHEREAS, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the 2020 Decennial Census will
cost an estimated $15.6 billion for which there is substantial budgetary shortfall that could result in an
adverse impact on the Census Bureau’s ability to accurately count every resident of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has one of the highest concentrations of hard-to-count populations in the state,
including racial minorities, immigrants, young children, tenants, and low-income households, among
others, and an outreach strategy must be developed and implemented to include them in the Census; and
WHEREAS, this will be the first decennial Census carried out in a primarily online format, which may
have a disparate impact on residents in hard-to-count communities who are more likely to face barriers
created by the digital divide; and
WHEREAS, a united voice from businesses, government, community and faith based organizations,
educators, media and others will allow the 2020 Census message to reach a broader audience, providing
trusted advocates who can spark positive conversations about the 2020 Census ensuring that all
communities are informed about the importance of the 2020 United States Census and that every resident
is counted.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President create a Complete
Count Committee and appoint a Chair of the Committee, as well as the chairs of subcommittees that are
representative of, and are directed to develop locally relevant outreach to all Cook County communities;
and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Complete Count Committee shall report to the Cook County Board
of Commissioners on the development of a comprehensive outreach strategy on a bi-monthly basis leading
up to the 2020 Census that shall include, but not be limited to sponsorship and partner funding initiatives
to encourage participation in the 2020 census, the establishment and support of school-based outreach
programs, partnerships with philanthropic organizations, non-profit community based organizations, and
multi-lingual, multi-media campaigns designed to ensure an accurate and complete count of Cook County's
population.

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORKER COOPERATIVES
IN COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS
WHEREAS, a “worker cooperative” is a business that is cooperatively owned and controlled by
itsworkers; and
WHEREAS, the worker cooperative model has proven to be an effective tool for creating and maintaining
sustainable, dignified jobs; generating wealth; improving the quality of life of workers; and promoting
community and local economic development, particularly for people who lack access to conventional
means of business ownership; and
WHEREAS, many worker cooperatives in the United States today were designed to improve low- wage
jobs and build wealth in communities most directly affected by inequality; and
WHEREAS, a 2009 University of Wisconsin study reported that there are an estimated 350 worker
cooperatives throughout the country with a combined estimated total revenue of $365 million, and it is
believed these estimates are much larger today; and
WHEREAS, the local economy has lost thousands of well-paying manufacturing jobs that have mostly
been replaced by minimum or low-wage service industry work and has expanded barriers to economic
mobility for people of color, returning citizens, and immigrants; and
WHEREAS, there is a growing number of worker cooperatives throughout Cook County that currently
lack access to capital, public awareness of the worker cooperative model, training and support services, and
also face significant legal complexity; and
WHEREAS, the mandate of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development includes fostering
business growth, attraction, and retention; supporting workforce development, job creation, and sustainable
employment; and, encouraging sustainable community investment; and
WHEREAS, worker cooperatives employ less common governance and financial structures, and because
the County currently lacks programming and resources to help these beneficial enterprises thrive.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners supports the
development and growth of worker cooperatives; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners celebrates the
tremendous benefits of worker cooperatives in Cook County and supports the movement to create more
worker cooperatives throughout the region; and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development is encouraged to
consider use of community development block grant (CDBG) funding where appropriate and other
appropriate sources of funding to support local worker cooperatives and cooperative conversions,
strengthen existing organizations that are incubating and training worker cooperatives in Cook County, and
help to equip other organizations to provide such services, focusing on services to low‐income residents or
in underserved areas; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Bureau of Economic Development is encouraged to help worker
cooperatives access tailored resources created by community organizations and make referrals to technical
assistance providers for individuals seeking to launch new worker cooperatives or convert conventional
businesses to worker ownership, as well as seek opportunities to partner with worker cooperative initiatives
such as the Chicagoland Cooperative Ecosystem Coalition on worker cooperative education initiatives; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, it is recommended that educational materials produced to serve as a
resource for worker cooperatives and data on related outreach and funding be made publicly available on
an annual basis where appropriate as determined by the partnerships created through this effort; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the federal, state and city of Chicago governments are encouraged to
take steps to support worker cooperatives.

A RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE CURRENT UNITED STATES
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND ILLINOIS ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AGENCY’S APPROVAL OF STERIGENICS’ OPERATION AND
PROTECTING SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY RESIDENTS FROM TOXIC AIR POLLUTION
WHEREAS, a recent federal report shows that some Cook County and DuPage County residents are
exposed to “the country’s highest cancer risks from toxic air pollution;” and
WHEREAS, according to the report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Sterigenics International Inc. (“Sterigenics”) is emitting elevated
levels of a cancer-causing chemical called ethylene oxide in its Willowbrook, Illinois, facilities; and
WHEREAS, data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2014 National Air Toxins Assessment
map shows that residents are exposed to elevated levels of ethylene oxide in and surrounding Willowbrook,
including in the Cook County municipalities of Burr Ridge, Indian Head Park, Hinsdale, Willow Springs,
Justice, Western Springs, La Grange, La Grange Park and Brookfield; and
WHEREAS, the current permit authorizing Sterigenics gives the United States Environmental Protection
Agency the authority to declare the facility a threat to public health and seek a court order to immediately
shut it down; and
WHEREAS, the current permit authorizing Sterigenics gives the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
the authority to declare the facility a threat to public health and seek a court order to immediately shut it
down; and
WHEREAS, in response to this crisis, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner stated: “This is not an emergency.
This is not a public health immediate crisis;” and
WHEREAS, the aforementioned federal report states that ethylene oxide is “highly reactive, readily
absorbed, and easily distributed in the human body” and is “carcinogenic to humans;” and
WHEREAS, the health of residents in Willowbrook and surrounding communities in Cook and DuPage
counties must take immediate priority; and
WHEREAS, the protection of citizens’ air quality in Illinois must become a priority of the State and local
governments; and

 WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency must commence immediate air quality monitoring in Cook and Dupage Counties.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that the
Board does hereby call on the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Illinois Governor Bruce
Rauner to immediately declare Sterigenics’s Willowbrook facilities a threat to public health and seek an
immediate court order to shut down the facilities until the company can prove that residents near the
facilities are no longer at risk; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County requests that the Office of
the Cook County State’s Attorney examine possible enforcement actions to protect the environment and
health the residents of Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a written copy of this Resolution be sent to the United States

Bruce Rauner.

Sponsored by: JESÚS G. GARCÍA, Cook County Board of Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ESTABLISHING AN EMERGENCY FUND TO ADDRESS THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION IN
THE 2020 CENSUS
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, the 2020 Census poses unprecedented challenges that may inhibit an accurate count of the
United States population such as a drastic reduction in field staff and the primary use of an online platform
for the first time; and
WHEREAS, among these challenges, the inclusion of an untested citizenship question has been proposed
by the Department of Commerce and accurate and reliable information on how the Census Bureau will
handle this question is not yet available; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has the largest concentration of foreign-born residents in the state of Illinois
and must be prepared to educate this population on the importance of participating in the Census to avoid
an undercount; and
WHEREAS, immigrants are among the hard-to-count populations that have experienced an undercount in
the past, with 11,000 very young Latino children having been missed in Cook County alone during the 2010
Census; and
WHEREAS, Illinois experienced total undercounts of 100,000 persons in 2000 and 128,000 in 2010 which
cost Cook County an estimated $19 - $25 million per year after each decennial survey based on the 2002
US Census Monitoring Committee report to Congress and the 2018 report from the George Washington
Institute on Public Policy ; and
WHEREAS, it is expected that with limited information on the citizenship question and the chilling effect
this population is already experiencing due to increased immigration enforcement, the number of persons
missed in an undercount will only increase; and
WHEREAS, based on the Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Report on federal awards issued to Cook County,
fourteen of the grants Cook County receives, which total over $43 million, are reliant on U.S. Census
population data; and
WHEREAS, without special efforts to ensure an accurate count of immigrant residents, Cook County is
primed not only to lose financially, but is leaving the civil rights and fair representation of its entire
population at stake; and

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that an Emergency Fund be established to conduct
specialized outreach to immigrant communities throughout Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a minimum of $200,000 from the $600,000 expected surplus in
operating funds described in the Fiscal Year 2018 Year-End Projections be allocated to this Fund under the
direction of the Chief Financial Officer to temporarily hire two (2) staff to manage the outreach and report
to members of the Cook County Complete Count Committee and the Board of Commissioners.

URGING PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THE DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THE
PUBLIC CHARGE RULE AND OPPOSING ANY FEDERAL REGULATORY CHANGE
THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, on October 10, 2018 the Federal Register published a proposed rule developed by the United
States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that would drastically change the “public charge” test for
individuals seeking admission to or legal permanent residency in the United States; and
WHEREAS, “public charge” currently refers to a person who is likely to become “primarily dependent”
on government services and as such may be barred from entering or gaining lawful status in the United
States or; and
WHEREAS, at present, public charge is limited to being a direct recipient of cash assistance including
General Assistance (GA), the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, or Supplemental
Security Income (SSI), or institutionalized long-term care at the government’s expense; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule changes public charge to consider likely use of or receipt of non-cash
assistance including non-emergency Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),
the low-income prescription drug subsidy for Medicare Part D, and certain federal housing benefit
programs; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule would also require DHS to consider the person’s age; medical condition;
family status; household assets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills in determining
whether that person is likely to become a public charge; and
WHEREAS, children, older adults, individuals with limited education and/or limited English proficiency,
and those with household income less than 250% of the federal poverty level will face more difficulty
getting approval to enter the United States or gain lawful status; and
WHEREAS, over half a million residents of Cook County - more than one tenth of the population - are
non-citizens; and

 WHEREAS, over 94,000 children in Illinois live in a household with at least one non-citizen receiving
SNAP and those households make up over 10% of Cook County households receiving SNAP; and
WHEREAS, the promulgation of the proposed rule may result in a significant “chilling effect” that will
lead to many eligible households dis-enrolling from or forgoing enrollment into benefits that help address
basic human needs such as health care, food/nutrition, and housing; and
WHEREAS, DHS’s proposed rule outlines possible impacts on those otherwise eligible for benefits,
including “worse health outcomes, including increased prevalence of obesity and malnutrition, especially
for pregnant or breastfeeding women, infants, or children, and reduced prescription adherence”; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule further outlines a direct impact on health systems with “increased use of
emergency rooms and emergent care as a method of primary health care due to delayed treatment”;
“increased prevalence of communicable diseases, including members of the United States citizen
population who are not vaccinated”; “increases in uncompensated care”; and
WHEREAS, in addition to public health, the proposed rule would impact overall social mobility as it would
create “increased rates of poverty and housing instability”; and “reduced productivity and educational
attainment.”; and
WHEREAS, an estimated $92 million annually is estimated to be lost by Cook County residents if at least
a quarter of households with at least one immigrant who receive these benefits were to withdraw from or
forgo enrollment; and
WHEREAS, promulgation of the proposed public charge rule would exacerbate heightened fear and
anxiety in the immigrant community and force many Cook County residents to make difficult decisions
about accessing basic services such as health care and nutrition assistance programs; and
WHEREAS, more than 50,000 households in Cook County include at least one (1) immigrant enrolled in
Medicaid; and
WHEREAS, the loss of Medicaid for Cook County residents could result in significant increases in
uncompensated care and decreased patient revenue from Medicaid reimbursement for Cook County Health
and Hospitals System and other hospital and healthcare providers in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners opposes any proposed change to the public charge
rule which could negatively impact residents in Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners opposes any
federal regulatory change that would negatively impact immigrant families and urges President Donald
Trump and the Department of Homeland Security to immediately withdraw the proposed public charge
rule; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County State’s Attorney send a response to the Federal
Register, under the rule making powers of the federal rules, indicating to the Department of Homeland
Security how strongly we are opposed to the proposed public charge rule; and

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners transmit a suitable
copy of this Resolution to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the United States Department
of Homeland Security and the members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.
Approved and adopted this 17th of October 2018.

WHEREAS, all County employees must abide by the rules and regulations laid out by that steering
committee and County policies, and
WHEREAS, County employees must also take annual ethics training courses, and
