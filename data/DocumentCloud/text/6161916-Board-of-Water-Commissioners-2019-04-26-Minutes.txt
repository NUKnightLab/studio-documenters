COMMENTS BY COMMISSIONERS
Commissioner Blackmon asked how the closure of the incinerator affects the
department transporting to the landfills. Director Brown replied that there was an effect
to the City's trash disposal. The Department of Public Works (DPW) were forced to
renegotiate contracts for additional landfill space. Commissioner Blackmon asked
whether it was difficult to find locations? Director Brown replied that it was not. She
also asked if any of the locations are in the city? Director Brown replied, no.
Commissioner Blackmon stated that at the last evening meeting of April 17, 2019,
Russ Bellant spoke about the 83/17 percent ruling. His ascertion was that the city is
getting an overflow from the highlift stations and that ruling should change and have
some impact on the renegotiation of that percentage. She asked if the department
were looking into it. Director Brown replied yes. He said the 83/17 rulling only applies
to 10 percent of the overall budget. He also said that this matter will be addressed in
the DWSD/GLWA reconciliation committee.
