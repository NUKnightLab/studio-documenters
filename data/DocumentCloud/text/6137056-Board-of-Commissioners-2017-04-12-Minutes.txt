PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Rudy Espiritu, Village Administrator, Village of Berkeley
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of Berkeley
Volume and Property Index Number: 157, 15-07-310-022-0000.
Summary: Thank you for the opportunity to submit a request for assistance through the No Cash Bid
Program. We are pleased to submit one (1) parcel for your consideration.
This unoccupied commercial property is located in close proximity to the Village Hall, under 1/10th of a
mile and comprises an estimated land square footage of 6,350 square feet. The existing structure has been
unoccupied with no water use since October of 2008. The Village will be exploring plans for usage by
Village sponsored clubs and organizations or possible expansion of Village offices for ease of providing
streamlined services. Therefore, the Village will file for tax exempt status on the property if tax deeds are
obtained. The Village also intends to retain ownership of the parcel and therefore will not be applying with
a Third Party.
The Village will retain legal counsel to assist with completion of the application, title search, tax deed
petition and will bear all other costs related to the acquisition of these parcels through the No Cash Bid
(NCB) Program and agrees to file NCB reports on the status of each parcel for five (5) years or until
development is complete, whichever occurs first.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Keith R. Sbrial, AICP, Village Manager, Village of Brookfield
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of Brookfield
Volume and Property Index Number: 075, 18-03-214-030-0000.
Summary: The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the “Village”) hereby requests no-cash bid acquisition of
the following parcel. This Request Package contains one (1) PIN referred to herein as the “Property.” The
Property is located at 8834 Ogden Avenue in the Village of Brookfield. The Property is improved with a
single-story commercial structure used as part of a retail facility selling custom countertops operating as
the Marble Place. The Village seeks to acquire and hold the Property for redevelopment pending a future
proposal by a yet-to-be-determined developer for commercial use of the Property. Acquisition of the
Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program will benefit the Village by potential
redevelopment of a commercial, tax-generating use of Property. Commercial development of the Property
will benefit the Village by increasing the Village’s property and sales tax base and by offering additional
employment opportunities to local residents.
If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax
exempt status and will maintain the Property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third party
for redevelopment. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a developer,
organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of a certificate of
purchase for, or perfected tax deed to, the Property to such a developer, organization, or private party.
The Village will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel. The Village
agrees to submit an annual report on the status of this parcel for five (5) years or until development is
complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid Ordinance.

Summary: The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the “Village”) hereby requests no-cash bid acquisition of
the following parcel. This Request Package contains one (1) PIN and is referred to herein as the “Property.”
The Property is located at 9401 Henrietta in the Village of Brookfield. The Property is currently a vacant
parcel of land between two (2) residential structures. By acquiring the Property through the Cook County

is improved with a dilapidated residential structure, currently the subject of a housing complaint filed by
the Village of Brookfield.
If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax
exempt status and will maintain the Property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third party
for development. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a developer,
organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of a certificate of
purchase for, or perfected tax deed to, the Property to such a developer, organization, or private party.
The Village will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel. The Village
agrees to submit an annual report on the status of this parcel for five (5) years or until development is

Summary: Please accept this letter as the Village of Glenwood’s application to participate in the Cook

the event these parcels are not eligible for the No Cash Bid Program, the Village is alternatively requesting
17

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

that an Over-The-Counter tax certificate be issued and assigned to the Village of Glenwood. This request
package is for the three (3) adjacent PINs listed above. The requested PINs are contiguous parcels that
contain a vacant dilapidated abandoned commercial site that was previously occupied by a restaurant that
has been closed for three (3) years. At the time the property was abandoned, the Village attempted to work
with the business occupying the parcels to see if it could utilize available TIF incentives to improve the
structure so that the restaurant can continue to operate. Ultimately, the Village concluded that the costs of
rehabilitating this structure so that it could continue to be useable as a restaurant was far more than the
value of the entire site. The structure on this property has continued to deteriorate and the Village believes
that it is now in a dangerous condition. It is the Village of Glenwood’s desire to obtain title to this property
so that it can demolish the hazardous structure located on this property so that the property can be
redeveloped by a private entity, returned to the property tax rolls and create additional employment
opportunities within the Village. This parcel is in the Village of Glenwood’s Main Street Tax Increment
Financing District. Accordingly, TIF incentives as allowed by the Tax Increment Allocation
Redevelopment Act would be available to incentivize the acquisition and redevelopment of this parcel by

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook County’s
No Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of eighty-nine (89)
Parcels of vacant land listed in our request and they are as follows. The City’s request will be indicated in
our Resolution to be introduced at the April 10, 2017 Council meeting. The City of Harvey requests eightynine (89) parcels of vacant land for the redevelopment of our major thoroughfares and Downtown Business
District areas.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. There is no Third Party Requestors
statement. The City of Harvey will file for tax exempt status for each parcel granted in our request. The
City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually on each parcel
for five (5) years or until the development is completed, whichever occurs last. If a City of Harvey lien is
cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the
City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the
lien after the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the

lien after the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

Summary: This second of two (2), one (1) year renewal options will allow the first time implementation

Commissioners November 2016. Due to the high volume of notifications that must be mailed, DOR is
requesting temporary assistance with the initial paper based and manual first year implementation of the
Sweetened Beverage Tax, including the administration of the one-time floor tax return for inventory on
hand, which will involve outreach to over 70,000 businesses. In addition, the temporary staff will assist
with the increased call volume from taxpayers and return processing until the implementation of the
modernized Integrated Tax Processing System. The use of temporary staff for these more administrative
duties will allow the current compliance staff to focus on their revenue generating enforcement tasks.
This contract was awarded as a Comparable Government Procurement pursuant to Section 34-140 of the
Cook County Procurement Code. KForce was previously awarded a contract through a Request for
Proposals (RFP) process by the State of Arizona. Cook County wishes to leverage this procurement effort.

Summary: In 2013, Cook County leveraged pricing discounts available to volume purchasers by
aggregating its technology needs with the City of Chicago. A joint City-County RFP was issued and
representatives from both government entities recommended that CDW Government LLC be awarded. The
contract allows County elected official IT departments to procure necessary software and equipment
through an online ordering system.
This Board subsequently approved a contract increase in 2015 to facilitate grant-funded purchases by the
Department of Homeland Security, and additional purchases for other offices under the President and
separately elected officials. The Board next approved an increase and first of two (2) renewal options
available in the contract to allow County agencies to continue to procure necessary software and equipment
in 2016. Both contract increases were accompanied by corresponding amendments to reduce the mark-up
cost for any newly added software items.
The Bureau of Technology now requests the second of two (2) renewal option for one-year and increase to
the contract in order to sustain County IT requirements for all elected official IT departments while an
ongoing replacement RFP process is completed.
This contract was awarded through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process in accordance with
the Cook County Procurement Code. CDW Government was awarded based on established evaluation
criteria.

WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon

intends to demolish the building, restore the land and keep and maintain it as open land or a park
for the benefit of the community.
The City will file for tax exempt status because the property will be for municipal use. There are
no third party requests for the parcel. Also, the City will pay all costs associated with this
acquisition, including my fees as City Attorney. It will submit a description of the status of the
parcel to the Cook County Planning & Development Department as required by the Cook
County No Cash Bid Ordinance. This report will be filed each year for the next five years

ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE,
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 30 Environment, of the
Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
CHAPTER 30 – ENVIRONMENT
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL
Sec. 30-1. - Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Cook County Environmental Control
Ordinance.
Sec. 30-2. - Findings, intent, and purpose and scope.
(a)
The County Board hereby finds and determines that in the public policy of the County to
preserve, protect and improve the air, water and land resources of the County so as to promote the health,
safety, welfare and comfort, prevent injury to human health, plant and animal life, and property; foster the
118

comfort and convenience of its inhabitants and to the greatest degree practicable, facilitate the enjoyment
of residents and visitors of the living, recreational and business environment of the County and recognizing
that environmental damage does not respect political boundaries or subdivisions of the County, and:
(1)

Recognizing that air, water, and other types of pollution, solid waste disposal and
noise are closely interrelated and must be dealt with as a unified whole;

(2)

Recognizing it is the obligation of the Board of Commissioners of the County to
manage the affairs of the County so as to minimize environmental damage and
encourage and assist local governmental agencies entities within the County to
adopt and implement environmental protection programs consistent with this
chapter;

(3)

Recognizing the need to assist industry and municipal corporations within the
County to promote the development of technology for environmental protection
and conservation of natural resources; and

(4)

Recognizing the desirability of uniform and consistent pollution abatement,
regulations, programs and enforcement, this chapter is being enacted.

(b)
The environment in which we live is a basic natural resource of the community. The purity
of this resource has been increasingly threatened with the incidental by-products of processes and activities
which constitute modern technology. Heating plants, vehicles, industrial processes, and various phases of
everyday living contribute increasingly to contamination of the environment. That such contamination, if
unchecked, works to the detriment of all by affecting health, property, and the appearance of the
community, is now a well-accepted fact.
(c)
Cook County in its rapid growth since World War II is becoming a completely urbanized
part of the Chicago Metropolitan Area. As such, it is both generator and recipient of environmental
contaminants which are increasing, and will continue to increase unless appropriate measures are taken.
(d)
To prevent this from happening, the people of the County, acting through their elected
representatives, have declared that environmental control legislation is both reasonable and desirable.
(e)
This chapter constitutes the above mentioned legislation. It applies to all existing and new
pollution sources within the County, except within the corporate limits of the City of Chicago. It has been
written to be comprehensive, fair to all concerned, and consistent with the latest scientific and technical
knowledge available. With its adoption, the chapter will secure for present and future citizensresidents of
the community an environment which is clean, healthful and wholesome.
(f)
The administration and enforcement of this chapter falls under the jurisdiction of the
Department of Environmental Control. Effective December 1, 2017, the Department of Environmental
Control will be renamed and referred to as the Department of Environment and Sustainability.
Sec. 30-3. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter shall have the meanings

Sec. 30-326. - Climate change mitigation.
(a)
Short title. This Ordinance [section] shall be known as "The Cook County Climate Change
Mitigation Act."
(b)
Joining the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Cook County shall enter into Phase II of
the CCX, committing to a reduction of 1.5 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions each year between
2006 and 2010.
The County will deliver energy consumption and other relevant data to the CCX which will assist
the County in creating an emissions baseline from which future reductions will be measured.
The County will develop a strategic plan within three months of the passage of this Ordinance
[section] that outlines where the County will cut greenhouse gas emissions by the amounts required, or
exceeding the amounts required, in Phase II of the CCX. This plan will be made publicly available through
the President's Web site.
As the emissions reduction plan is implemented, the County will sell any extra emissions credits
that it has on the CCX's online trading platform.
(c)

Effective date. This Ordinance [section] shall take effect on January 1, 2009.

Secs. 30-327324-30-350380. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - EPISODES
Sec. 30-351. - Generally.
(a)
This division is designed to prevent, during periods of atmospheric stagnation, ambient air
pollution concentrations from reaching levels which could cause significant harm to the health of humans.
Emissions which do not normally cause established air quality standards to be exceeded might well be
capable of producing dangerously high concentrations of pollutants during periods of atmospheric
stagnation. Such periods, generally of a few days duration, occur whenever high atmospheric pressure,
very low wind speeds, and a temperature inversion exist in the same place at the same time. These
conditions prevent normal ventilation of the air both horizontally and vertically, and pollutants released
into the atmosphere are literally trapped near their sources.
(b)
In highly industrialized areas, if atmospheric stagnation persists, pollutants can reach
unusually high levels and a serious threat to public health may result. During recorded episodes of
atmospheric stagnation, an increase in the number of cases of illness and death has occurred with
substantial evidence that air pollution was the cause.
Sec. 30-352. - Monitoring.
177

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

April 12, 2017

(a)
For purposes of this division, monitoring stations used to determine watch, alert, or
emergency levels shall be officially recognized stations located in any portion of the Federally designated
air quality control region in which a part of the County is included and shall be located according to
guidelines for establishment of air quality surveillance networks as developed by the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency, and shall use measurement methods or equivalent methods as officially
authorized by that agency.
(b)
If any monitoring station registers air contaminant concentrations in excess of any episode
level and if weather conditions indicate that such concentrations would not be expected, proper operation
of the sampling equipment at these stations will be verified by the Department before the concentrations
are used to declare any watch, alert, or emergency level.
Sec. 30-353. - Determination of actions required.
To the maximum degree practicable, emission control actions taken pursuant to this division shall
be consistent with the extent of any air pollution alert or emergency. When the Department determines
that the existence of any episode level is exclusively caused by one or more specific emission sources,
emission control action steps applicable to such source or sources shall be taken. When the Department
determines that the existence of any episode level is exclusively caused by one or more specific air
contaminants, action shall be taken to reduce the concentration of such contaminant or contaminants.
Sec. 30-354. - Episode levels.
(a)
An episode may be initiated with any of the following four levels, which are, in order of
increasing severity of air contamination:
(1)

Watch.

(2)

Yellow alert.

(3)

Red alert.

(4)

Emergency.

(b)
During an episode, the Department, through its monitoring facilities, may declare different
levels throughout the County as the Director or representatives deem necessary.
Sec. 30-355. - Areas affected by watch, alert, or emergency.
A watch shall be declared for the County portion of the air quality control region of which it is a
part, excluding the municipality of Chicago, if any part of the air quality control region meets the watch
criteria set forth in Section 30-356(b). When part of the County has acceptable air quality but air
contaminant levels at one or more monitoring stations are high enough to call for alert or emergency
action, corridors of the region shall be defined depending upon meteorological factors, emission inventory
data, and mathematical simulation modeling, alerts or emergencies shall then be declared for one or more
of these individual corridors.
Sec. 30-356. - Episode action watch.

No person shall cause, suffer, allow or permit the emission of particulate matter in any one
hour from any source in excess of the amount shown in Section 30-382(b)(1), Section 30382(c)(1), or Section 30-382(d)(1), whichever is applicable, for the process weight rate
allocated to such source or in excess of 0.1 grains per standard cubic foot of exhaust at any
given time during the process where Section 30-382(b)(1), (c)(1), or (d)(1) is not
applicable.

(2)

Process weight per hour, or process weight rate, is the actual weight or engineering
approximation thereof of all materials except liquid and gaseous fuels and combustion air,
introduced into any process per hour. For a cyclical or batch operation, the process weight
per hour will be derived by dividing the total process weight by the number of hours in one
complete operation from the beginning of any given process to the completion thereof,
excluding any time during which the equipment is idle. For a continuous operation, the
process weight per hour will be derived by dividing the process weight for a typical period
of time.

(3)

Where the nature of any process or operation or the design of any equipment is such as to
permit more than one interpretation of this regulation, the interpretation that results in the
minimum value for allowable emission shall apply.

(4)

For purposes of this section, the total process weight from all similar process units at a
plant or premises shall be used for determining the maximum allowable emission of
particulate matter that passes through a stack or stacks.

summarily abated by the Director. Such abatement may be in addition to the administrative
proceedings herein provided.

(2)

The Director is further empowered to institute legal proceedings for the abatement or
prosecution of emissions of smoke, particulate or other matter which causes injury,
detriment, nuisance or annoyance to the public or endangers the health, comfort, safety, or
welfare of the public, or causes or has a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to
business or property. Such abatement may be in addition to the administrative proceedings
herein provided.

(b)
Preservation of common law rights. Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair any
cause of action, or legal remedy therefor, of any person or the public for injury or damage arising from
the discharge, emission, or release into the atmosphere from any source whatsoever of such quantities of
smoke, soot, fly ash, dust, cinders, dirt, noxious or obnoxious acids, fumes, oxides, gases, vapors, odors,
toxic or radioactive substances, waste, particulate, solid, liquid, or gaseous matter, or any other materials
in such place, manner, or concentration as to constitute atmospheric pollution, or a common law nuisance.
Subdivision III. - EPISODES
Sec. 30-410. - Generally.
(a)
This division is designed to prevent, during periods of atmospheric stagnation, ambient air
pollution concentrations from reaching levels which could cause significant harm to the health of humans.
Emissions which do not normally cause established air quality standards to be exceeded might well be
capable of producing dangerously high concentrations of pollutants during periods of atmospheric
stagnation. Such periods, generally of a few days duration, occur whenever high atmospheric pressure,
very low wind speeds, and a temperature inversion exist in the same place at the same time. These
conditions prevent normal ventilation of the air both horizontally and vertically, and pollutants released
into the atmosphere are literally trapped near their sources.

(b)
In highly industrialized areas, if atmospheric stagnation persists, pollutants can reach
unusually high levels and a serious threat to public health may result. During recorded episodes of
atmospheric stagnation, an increase in the number of cases of illness and death has occurred with
substantial evidence that air pollution was the cause.
Sec. 30-411. - Monitoring.
(a)
For purposes of this division, monitoring stations used to determine watch, alert, or
emergency levels shall be officially recognized stations located in any portion of the Federally designated
air quality control region in which a part of the County is included and shall be located according to
guidelines for establishment of air quality surveillance networks as developed by the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency, and shall use measurement methods or equivalent methods as officially
authorized by that agency.
(b)
If any monitoring station registers air contaminant concentrations in excess of any air
quality index level and if weather conditions indicate that such concentrations would not be expected,
proper operation of the sampling equipment at these stations will be verified by the Department before the
concentrations are used to declare any watch, alert, or emergency level.
Sec. 30-412. - Determination of actions required.
To the maximum degree practicable, emission control actions taken pursuant to this division shall
be consistent with the extent of any air pollution alert or emergency. When the Department determines
that the existence of any air quality index level is exclusively caused by one or more specific emission
sources, emission control action steps applicable to such source or sources shall be taken. When the
Department determines that the existence of any air quality index level is exclusively caused by one or
more specific air contaminants, action shall be taken to reduce the concentration of such contaminant or
contaminants.
Sec. 30-413. - Air Quality Index Levels
The Department may communicate to the public the level of air quality throughout suburban Cook
County per the Air Quality Index.

(a)
Diesel exhaust particle pollution poses a clear and present health risk to the people of Cook
County. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified diesel exhaust as a likely
human carcinogen, and has identified diesel particulate matter and diesel exhaust organic gases as toxic
air pollutants. Diesel exhaust is also a prime contributor to airborne fine particle pollution that is linked to
premature death and other serious cardiovascular and pulmonary problems such as heart attacks, abnormal
heart rhythms, atherosclerosis, stroke, asthma attacks, permanent respiratory damage and retardation of
lung growth in children.
(b)
pollution.

Cook County is a U.S. EPA designated nonattainment area for fine particulate matter

(c)
The health impacts from diesel emissions particularly affect children, the elderly, and
people with weakened immune systems.
(d)
Particularly high concentrations of diesel emissions often occur in heavily traveled
transportation corridors, intermodal yards, bus depots, and construction sites; these diesel "hot spots" often
are found in densely populated, urban areas, disproportionately impacting ethnic minorities and people of
lower economic status.
(e)
Diesel engine crankcases also are a source of emissions that can seep into the cabin and
expose vehicle drivers and passengers to harmful diesel emissions.
(f)

Diesel exhaust also contains black carbon emissions, which contribute to global climate

(g)
problems.

Reduction of diesel emissions can help address these human health and environmental

change.

(h)
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has enacted requirements over the
past few years requiring the substantial reduction of emissions from new diesel engines in both heavyduty highway vehicles and land-based nonroad equipment. However, these regulations do not apply to
any of the over 11 million existing diesel engines in the United States, most of which emit substantially
more pollution and often remain in service for ten to 30 years, depending on the type of engine and
equipment.
(i)
Practical, cost-effective measures to substantially reduce diesel particulate emissions are
available today, and can be applied to many existing diesel engines. The same technology that limits diesel

ANSI means the American National Standards Institute or its successor bodies.
ARI means the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute or its successor bodies.
ASHRAE means the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers

Fluctuating noise means a noise whose sound pressure level varies significantly but does not equal
the ambient environmental level more than once during the period of observation.
IEC means the International Electrotechnical Commission or its successor bodies.
Impulsive noise means a noise characterized by brief excursions of sound pressure (acoustic
impulses) which significantly exceed the ambient environmental sound pressure. The duration of a single
impulse is usually less than one second.
Intermittent noise means a noise whose sound pressure level equals the ambient environmental
level two or more times during the period of observation. The time during which the level of the noise
remains at an essentially constant value different from that of the ambient is on the order of one second or
more.
ISO means the International Standards Organization or its successor bodies.
Maximum level continuous or semi-continuous vibration means the root mean square (rms) value
of the oscillatory particle motion of the structure or land area involved with the transducer oriented to
produce a maximum indication.

Peak level of an impulsive sound means the maximum excursion of the sound pressure level as
detected by methods and instruments approved by the Director and described in any of the Department's
Suggested Guidelines for control of Noise and Vibration when published.
Peak level impulsive vibration means the vector sum of the instantaneous peak level of all three
components, one vertical and two horizontal of the earthborne impulses measured at or beyond the
boundaries of the emitter's property.
Period of observation means the period of observation is the time interval during which acoustical
data are obtained. The period of observation is determined by the characteristics of the noise being
measured and should also be at least ten times as long as the response time of the instrumentation. The
greater the variance in indicated sound level, the longer must be the observation time for a given expected
accuracy of the measurement.
SAE means the Society of Automotive Engineers or its successor bodies.
Sound level means a general term for the metered value root mean square of the pressure of an air
borne sound as measured under a defined condition of frequency weighting and meter response rate. With
a conventional sound level meter the duration time of the sound should be much longer than the response
time of the meter. In most cases, levels in this article are specified as measured with "A" scale standard
frequency weighted responses and are always then noted as db (A) (standard reference level as in "sound
pressure level" below is always implied). Peak levels of impulse sounds are always specified as measured
with flat, nonweighted, or "C" scale response. Such peak levels are noted as db only, not db "C," and "C"
weighting is defined as a flat, "unweighted" response. Peak values as specified in this article are the
absolute values of the maximum instantaneous sound pressure levels attained throughout the duration of
any impulse sounds not the root mean square equivalents and require a special meter which can capture
and store for display these maxima. See peak level of an impulse sound.
Sound pressure level means the sound pressure level in decibels, of a level, in decibels, of a sound
is 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound to the reference sound
pressure. Unless otherwise specified, the effective root mean square pressure is to be understood. The
reference sound pressure is 20Un/m2. (Often used interchangeably with sound level.)
Steady noise means noise whose level remains essentially constant (i.e. fluctuations are negligibly
small) during the period of observation is a steady noise.
Vibration means a vibration is the oscillatory motion of the particles of a solid, propagated as a
wave, which is felt through physical contact rather than heard. Any vibration can, however, under proper
conditions produce a radiated audible sound wave, but this is to be considered a secondary, separate
consequence herein, unless specifically cited.
Zoning district means those districts established by Appendix A, Zoning.
Sec. 30-451. - Penalty.
Any person found guilty of violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting, or refusing to comply
with, or resisting or opposing the enforcement of any of the provisions of this article, except when
otherwise specifically provided, upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $25.00

nor more than $300.00 for the first offense, and not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00 for the second
and each subsequent offense, in any 180-day period, or shall be punishable as a misdemeanor by
incarceration in the County jail for a term not to exceed six months, or by both fine and imprisonment. A
separate and distinct offense shall be regarded as committed each day on which such person shall continue
or permit any such violation, or failure to comply as permitted to exist after notification thereof.
Sec. 30-452. - Public performance exemption.
The operational performance standards established by this ordinance shall not apply to any public
performance being conducted in accordance with the provisions of a special permit granted by the County
for the conduct of a public performance.
Sec. 30-453. - Excess noise or vibration declared a public nuisance.
Any emission of noise or earth-shaking vibration from any source in excess of the limitations
established in or pursuant to this article shall be deemed and is hereby declared to be a public nuisance,
and may be subject to summary abatement procedures. Such abatement may be in addition to the
administrative proceedings, fines and penalties herein provided. The Director is empowered to secure the
institution of legal proceedings for the abatement or prosecution of emissions of noise and earth-shaking
vibration which cause injury, detriment, nuisance or annoyance to the public or endanger the health,
comfort, safety or welfare of the public, or cause or have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to
public property. Such legal proceedings may be in addition to the administrative proceedings, fines and
penalties herein provided.
Sec. 30-454. - Other private or public nuisance action not impaired.
Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair any cause of action, or legal remedy therefor,
of any person or the public for injury or damage arising from the emission or release into the atmosphere
or ground from any source whatever of noise or earthshaking vibration in such place or manner, or at such
levels, so as to constitute a common-law nuisance.
Secs. 30-455-30-457. - Reserved.
Sec. 30-458. - Scavenger operations.
All scavenger operations in the unincorporated areas of Cook County, commercial and municipal,
shall limit the actual contact hours involved in the pickup of refuse and all other solid waste in any
residential or business-commercial zone (R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-5A, R-6, R-7, R-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, C4 and C-5 ) wherever regular human occupancy is involved by virtue of residence only and such
contiguous portions of any I-1, I-2, I-3 or 1-4 zone within 600 feet of any such place of regular residence
or the institutional equivalents (hospitals, nursing homes, etc.) to the period of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
These limits apply only to those contact periods wherein the collection function is in progress in R-1, R2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-5A, R-6, R-7, R-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-5) and contiguous portions of I-1, I-2, I3 and 1-4 zones and are not intended to include or confine such functions as start up and shut down
operations at the central operating point (transfer station, sanitary landfill, incinerator, etc.) or the transit
time of the first trip to and the last trip from the defined collection areas. Noise levels in such central
operating points shall be governed by the property line values applicable for the location ( Sections 30464 through 30-467). The exemptions on engine operation when parked of Section 30-460(a) shall apply

these hours is in the overall public interest or operationally essential, special variance can be requested for
such period as can likewise be shown necessary.
Sec. 30-459. - Use of construction equipment.
It shall be unlawful for any person to use any pile driver, shovel, roller or other mechanical
apparatus operated by fuel or electric power in building or construction operations between the hours of
6:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. except for emergency work on public service utilities, within 600 feet of any
building used for residential or hospital purposes. An exception to this rule can be made at the discretion
of the Director and special operating hours permitted when to the Director's satisfaction it can be shown
that more extended work hours would in any given case be in the overall public interest or technically
essential, such as continuous cement pouring.
Sec. 30-451460. - Idling of motor vehicles; nNew motor vehicle noise; performance; motor vehicle
use noise performance; muffler modification.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or permit the operation of the main engine of
any vehicle when parked or standing, except for the following:
(1)

Whenever engaged in any rescue operations attendant to accident or other common
disaster.

(2)

Whenever operation of the main power train is essential to a basic function as with, but not
necessarily limited to, premixed cement trucks, platform lift trucks, compactor refuse
trucks, certain varieties of dump trucks and the like, while function is in action.

(3)

Whenever weather conditions justify the use of heating or air-conditioning systems for the
welfare and safety of any occupants (or future passengers in the case of public vehicles
stopped in turn around or other such waiting areas) or when such low temperatures prevail
that the startup of public conveyances or service vehicles might not otherwise be feasible.

(4)

Whenever the need for operation of refrigeration equipment on trailers carrying perishable
contents is recognized, but then must conform with the appropriate boundary levels
involved by location and most especially so when parked overnight in any district adjacent
to occupied residences. In general when parked, the use of auxiliary power sources shall
be subject to the same general caution regarding applicability of other noise level
restrictions for operation of the main engine and when the vehicle is in motion shall be
considered simply as a component of the overall resultant sound level as specified by
Subsection (c)(1) below or in the case of private travel trailers with auxiliary air
conditioning by Subsection (c)(3) and these latter, even while legally parked are subject to
the same lot line and zone noise level restrictions described above.

(5)

Whenever main or auxiliary engines are operated for emergency repairs, or when properly
housed for professional maintenance (subject to appropriate boundary level restrictions)
and the occasional maintenance such as cleaning and flushing of the radiator and associated

or any other source the propagation of earthborne tremors, continuous or intermittent vibrations or sharp
impulses and shocks into any structure involving regular human occupancy whether by virtue of residence,
occupation, commerce, recreation or other such reason, such that continued daily exposure is involved
and located on any property in the aforesaid zones (neither from one property lot to another within any
one zone, nor from any property lot in one zone to any property lot in another zone of any of the three
designated) of an intensity perceptible without the aid of instruments in the sense that the maximum
amplitude of such vibrations shall never equal that level commonly referred to in the art as "imperceptible"
or "threshold of perceptibility," or indistinguishable from the ambient, whichever is higher. (In terms of
an instrumented decision in the latter case, the presence or absence of the given vibration shall not produce
any change in the metered value of the ambient to show compliance, i.e., for a violation not to exist).
Propagation of vibrations into I-1, I-2 and I-3 Zones shall be prescribed by the rules pertaining within
these zones as set forth below.
Sec. 30-469. - I-2 Zone vibration standards.
No person located in an I-2 General Industrial Zone, where higher energy operations such as
impact extrusion, forming and stamping or any other such activity occurs, shall propagate into any
structure involving regular human occupancy for any lawful reason as noted above and thus daily exposure
and located in any R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-5A, R-6, R-7, R-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 and I-1 Zone
earthborne tremors, vibrations, etc., more than barely perceptible without the aid of instruments in the
sense that the maximum amplitude involved can equal but not exceed by more than one db that level
known in the art as "imperceptible" or "threshold of perceptibility" or of such level that they are barely
distinguishable from the ambient, whichever is greater. (In terms of an instrumented decision in the latter
case, the presence or absence of the given vibration shall not cause a change of more than one db from the
metered value of the ambient, e.g., introduction of the vibration of which a resident has complained shall
not produce an increase in excess of one db in the meter reading obtained at the person's residence).
Vibration levels propagated within I-2 Zones may enter into the "just perceptible" or "barely perceptible"
levels (save for personnel immediately involved with the operation of the source equipments where clearly
234

perceptible levels may be unavoidable), but shall not approach levels and durations of exposure for any
personnel that could result in discomfort or fatigue or in any other way produce a state endangering safety
or welfare.
Sec. 30-470. - I-3 and I-4 Zone vibration standards.
The same general conditions for propagation of vibrations and earthborne tremors into R-1, R-2,
R-3, R-4, R-5, R-5A, R-6, R-7, R-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 and I-1 Zones as described above for I-2
Zones shall hold for operations located in I-3, heavy manufacturing and I-4, Motor Freight Terminals,
save that since even higher energy operations such as heavy forging, impact forming and stamping of
large parts, the constant ingress and egress of heavy trucks and the like are involved the maximum
amplitude of vibrations propagated into the R-1-R-8, C-1-C-5 and I-1 Zones may exceed the level
commonly known as "imperceptible" or "threshold of perceptibility" and enter into the range commonly
identified as "just perceptible" or "barely perceptible," but not by more than a maximum of three db, or of
such a level as to equal but not exceed the ambient, whichever is greater. (In terms of an instrumented
decision in the latter case the presence or absence of the given vibration shall not cause a change of more
than three db from the metered value of the ambient). The propagation of vibrations within I-3 and I-4
Zones shall be governed as are vibration within I-2 Zones.
Sec. 30-471. - Regulations for impulse noise and vibration resulting from controlled detonations.
(a)

Standard regulations.

(1)

Earth tremors. No person shall cause or permit as the result of such controlled and earth
confined explosions as are employed in quarrying, earth-moving, tunneling, road building,
excavating and the like the propagation of earth tremors and impulse vibrations of the
closest structure beyond the emitter's property line which result in a particle velocity in/sec
based on frequency HZ in any of three components, longitudinal, vertical, or transverse
components in excess of the graph shown at the end of this section.

(2)

Airborne impulse sounds. No person as the result of any such blasting activities indicated
above, including continued daily exposure, shall propagate at or beyond the boundaries of
the emitter's property, air blasts and impulsive sounds which when measured at or beyond
the boundaries of the emitter's property involved are found to have a peak sound pressure
level in excess of 125 db.

(b)
Preemption of control of very high level impulses by State or Federal legislation involving
potential damage to living creatures.
(1)

Under no circumstances shall any person cause or permit the propagation beyond the
property lines involved in any permanently located operation such a quarrying (or in the
case of operations of potentially variable location such as construction, road building and
the like beyond the boundaries of any control zone established by State or Federal
legislation) of earthborne vibrations or air borne impulse sounds which shall exceed any
safety limits or damage risk criteria set forth now or in the future by any State or Federal
legislation involving the health, safety or physical injury of humans, domestic animals,
farm animals or wildlife as shall be specified in any such legislation.
