Good afternoon Chairman Daley and County Commissioners. Thank you for
your continued support for time- and money-saving initiatives in the Cook
County Clerk’s office. I am pleased to present you with our budget for 2014.
We continue to do more with less. We have undertaken new projects and
adopted many innovations even with a reduced budget:
√√Our total budget is down $1.47 million from 2010, the last comparable
election year.
√√Our 524 Elections account alone has been cut by nearly $1 million, a
4 percent decrease since 2010.
√√Our head count is down 7.6 percent since 2010, from 310 to 278
employees. This includes two positions cut for the 2014 budget.
√√Our revenue exceeds our corporate 110 budget by $800,000.

 Our multi-year strategic planning has allowed us to adopt new technology
and cross-train staff to work in several divisions.
Just one example is our 20 Year Tax Search tool. At the beginning of the
2013 fiscal year we launched an online system allowing individuals, property
owners and banks to search for outstanding or sold taxes on our website.
The result was 33% fewer phone calls to Tax Services over a comparable
period during the previous year.

After the December 2012
launch of our Delinquent
Property Tax Search,
our Tax Services division
experienced a significant
drop in customer calls.
From FY 2012 to FY 2013,
the number of calls dropped
33 percent.

 At a time when elections are more demanding than ever, we have to take on
new responsibilities without increasing our budget or positions.
In elections alone, we have had several changes in just a few years:
√√no fault mail balloting
√√a longer grace period
√√early voting closer to election day
√√unveiling judge connect—a web-based judge communications tool
√√and a new online ballot request system for overseas and military voters

While overall turnout dipped slightly from 2008 to 2012, the number of voters casting ballots before
Election Day grew to 27 percent of all ballots cast. Nearly twice as many people registered and voted
during the grace period and mail voting increased by 33 percent.

 This coming year will see more innovations. The 2013 elections omnibus bill,
HB 2418 passed this summer, charged us with many new tasks to implement
for the 2014 gubernatorial primary and general elections. We expect our
technological experience to really pay off when we adopt online mail ballot
requests and when the State of Illinois implements online voter registration
in July.
Here are a few highlights from 2013 and projections for 2014:

8

 MAIL BALLOT REQUESTS: As part of HB 2418, election authorities
may accept mail ballot requests online, beginning with the March 18 primary.
We are now developing an interface to provide this service to voters. This
dovetails nicely with the law passed several years ago to allow voting by mail
without an excuse. Online mail
ballot requests will simplify
the process for voters and our
office by cutting out some backand-forth in the mail.
Already, our vigorous mail
balloting and early voting
programs mean that 27 percent
of voters cast their ballots
before Election Day for the
2012 presidential election, up
from 24 percent in 2008.

9

 ONLINE VOTER REGISTRATION: Another key provision of HB
2418 is the requirement for Illinois to offer online voter registration to
eligible citizens with driver’s licenses and state IDs, beginning in July. I have
been a longtime proponent of online voter registration, which 18 other states
already offer.
The benefits of online
voter registration include
lower costs and fewer
errors and omissions from
voter registration forms.
We expect to realize similar
advantages since direct
data transmission from
the Secretary of State and
State Board of Elections
eliminates the need to scan
applications.
10

 ELECTRONIC POLLBOOKS: In April 2013 we conducted a successful
trial using electronic pollbooks in precincts on Election Day. E-pollbooks
reduce check-in time, eliminate errors in processing provisional ballots and
help judges easily re-direct ‘lost’ voters to their proper precincts. In 2014,
we will expand our use of e-pollbooks, deploying them in up to half of our
precincts by November.
Like the high-speed mail
sorter we purchased in
2012, our e-pollbooks
were purchased with grant
funds, allowing taxpayers to
benefit without bearing the
cost of acquisition.

11

 NEW MEDIA: Since releasing our Smartphone Voter Tool, which lets
voters check their voter registration and ballot information on the go, we
have beefed up our use of other new media. Notably, we now have YouTube
videos in multiple languages, including a guide to voter registration, and a
deputy registrar training refresher.
“Understanding TIFs,” a
primer on TIF districts,
was released in July. It is
already one of our most
popular videos, and has
been linked to many
organizational and media
websites.
We are also working on ways to harness the power of resources like Twitter,
which can allow voters to have access to information on the fly on Election
Day.
12

 ASSUMED BUSINESS NAMES: Our Bureau of Vital Records continues
to use technology to improve customer service. Last year, we worked with
the Secretary of State to dramatically reduce wait time for issuing a Notary
Commission. With the help of the County Board, we also standardized fees
this year.
We just finished revamping
our Assumed Business Names
system in September by creating
an online system to modernize
business name registration,
and to allow consumers to
browse the database. We also
upgraded the official documents
we provide to businesses.
Altogether, our new practices are
more user-friendly and should
generate more revenue.
13

 LICENSING SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS: This past year, the
Bureau of Vital Records also launched a new software application for
managing marriage and civil union records in Cook County. This software
program has many features, including capturing modern data, such as email
addresses.
It also allowed us to bring a new
product online in 2013—wallet-sized
official marriage and civil union
certificates. These certificates
appeal to partners with different
last names, frequent travelers, and
same-sex couples. Many couples
purchase these in addition to, not
in place of, traditional, full-sized
certificates.

14

 GENEALOGY ENHANCEMENT: The Bureau of Vital Records
continues to scan and index new genealogical records to market through our
Genealogy Online portal. CookCountyGenealogy.com has now brought in
more than $2 million since its launch in July 2008. That’s more than 130,000
genealogy records sold in five years. We expect revenues to remain steady as
more records age into availability.

 TIF AMOUNTS ON TAX BILL:
For the summer of 2014, we will add
the tax amount the Tax Increment
Financing district will receive to the
TIF line item already found on the
tax bill. This will allow citizens to
compare how much of their tax bill
is going to the taxing bodies, like
schools, and how much is going to
the TIF. We are working with the
Bureau of Technology to implement
this transparency initiative.

 TWENTY YEAR TAX SEARCH: As previously mentioned, our new
online 20 Year Tax Search allows property owners and mortgage and title
companies to check for back taxes at any time, night or day.
This year we began to realize
its benefits, as our phone
inquiries fell from 66,000
to 44,000 over comparable
periods. At the same time, page
views on our website doubled.

17

 GIS TAX MAPPING UPGRADE: In conjunction with the County’s GIS,
our office is in the process of upgrading the parcel maintenance application.
This upgrade will allow us to provide improved analysis by incorporating
3D mapping capabilities. Plus, it will streamline and centralize workflow
across multiple county tax agencies and aid in the storage and automation of
documentation.

18

 In non-budget news, we are proud that many jurisdictions around the state
and country are utilizing our software innovations. Clerks in Illinois have
adapted our software for filing Statements of Economic Interests, and other
states have expressed interest in using the
incident-tracking software we developed for
election issues. Likewise, after its test-run in
the March primary, we plan to make our online
ballot request tool available to clerks around
the state.
Finally, this year we were able to deliver
printed versions of our popular Directory of
Elected Officials on a quicker schedule, thanks
to software shortcuts.

Thank you. I am happy to answer any questions.
