Projects
Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for Joe Louis Arena
Mr. Vosburg introduced the Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for Joe Louis Arena to the CAC
members present.
A Plan Amendment is being requested due to increased Eligible Activities that have recently been
discovered by environmental consultants working on behalf of the City of Detroit. Abatement and
Demolition activities have increased from $3.6 million the original Plan to approximately $8.8 million in the
Plan Amendment. Engineering Services: Demo Design has increased from $790,286 to $840,286. New
Eligible Costs of Due Care Activities, Response Activities and Interest totaling approximately $2.7 million
are new Eligible Cost. In total, the Eligible Costs have increased from $5,561,009 to $14,363,147.
Project Introduction
In connection with the development of the property commonly known as the “Little Caesars Arena”, an
agreement was reached by the applicable parties to demolish the JLA once the Little Caesars Arena was
completed and ready for use. As of the date of this Plan, the Little Caesars Arena has been completed and
the Detroit Red Wings have vacated the JLA and relocated to the Little Caesars Arena.
The primary purpose of this Plan Amendment is to increase the amount of tax increment revenues that can
be captured for reimbursement of eligible activities. This increase is a result of additional information that
was subsequently discovered following the original Brownfield Plan approval. The capture of tax increment
revenues pursuant to the Plan Amendment is to reimburse for eligible activities in connection with the
demolition of the JLA and to prepare the Property for a future mixed-use development, which may include
residential, commercial, and/or retail space. For the purposes of this Plan, the use of the term “Developer”
shall refer to the City of Detroit. The City of Detroit is the owner of Joe Louis Arena and the Detroit Building
Authority will oversee demolition.
Total TIF reimbursement amount for the demolition and related eligible activities under this Plan is
$14,363,147.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of six (6) parcels located at 27 Washington Boulevard. The
common address of the JLA is also known as “600 Civic Center Drive.” 25 Washington Boulevard, 29
Washington Boulevard, 31 Washington Boulevard, and 33 Washington Boulevard are properties that are

 adjacent and continuous to 27 Washington Boulevard. 501 Third is also adjacent to 27 Washington
Boulevard and is the location of the Detroit People Mover – Joe Louis Arena Station Stop. The Property is
located adjacent to the Central Business District and is generally bounded by Jefferson Street to the north,
Atwater Street to the east, Detroit River to the south and Cobo Convention Center to the west.
Basis of Eligibility
The Property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the Property
was previously utilized for a public purpose; (b) it is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local
governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is determined to be a functionally obsolete or
adjacent and contiguous as defined by Act 381.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible activities”
as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include environmental assessment activities, demolition and
abatement and brownfield plan and work plan preparation and brownfield plan implementation. The eligible
activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed
solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no
debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin within eighteen months and be completed within three
(3) years.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible
activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement
Agreement with the DBRA.

Other Incentives
The Developer is seeking a loan through the Michigan Strategic Fund’s Community Revitalization Program.
Ms. Rice provided more detail regarding the need for an amended Plan for the Project including that
additional environmental investigation was completed and discovered additional asbestos behind the metal
panels on the exterior of the arena and some patching on the ceiling of the fourth floor, and that the third
floor of the arena is expensive to access and is believed to have asbestos materials as well.
Ms. Lee asked if there has been a plan established for the removal of the asbestos materials. Ms. Rice
stated that there are various companies placing bids for the services to remove the asbestos and that the
process will be documented in a Work Plan to be submitted to the Michigan Department of Environmental
Quality for review and approval and that the process will be monitored by the Building Safety, Engineering,
and Environmental Department of the City of Detroit.
Mr. Cheeks asked what the impact to the Plan will be if no asbestos materials are found on the third floor
of the arena. Mr. Vosburg stated that the eligible costs identified in the Plan are the worst-case scenario
and that only actual, certified costs will be reimbursed.
Mr. Rawls asked if the Detroit Building Authority will ensure that the costs are verified and reasonable. Ms.
Rice confirmed that the Detroit Building Authority will ensure that all costs are verified and reasonable.
Mr. Lutz asked if the additional asbestos materials will impact the timeline for the demolition of the arena.
Ms. Rice stated that the Detroit Building Authority will be selecting a contractor for the removal of the
asbestos materials in the next few weeks, the interior demolition of the arena will start in early 2019 with
the removal of the exterior metal panels beginning in June of 2019. Total demolition is expected to follow
an 11-12 month schedule and be completed by early 2020.
Mr. Rawls asked if the People Mover station connected to the arena via elevated walkways will be
demolished as well. Ms. Rice stated that the portion of the elevated walkway connecting the People Mover
station to the arena will be removed, but that the rest of the People Mover station and the elevated walkways
will remain.
Mr. Rawls asked how the costs were determined for the removal of the asbestos materials on the third floor
of the arena. Ms. Rice stated that the costs were based on the total square footage of the third floor
assuming that the asbestos materials are present in the entirety of the third floor of the arena.
Ms. Lee asked what year Joe Louis Arena was built. Ms. Rice stated that Joe Louis Arena was constructed
in 1978, before the use of asbestos materials were prohibited in construction.

 Mr. Rawls called for a motion recommending approval of the Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for
Joe Louis Arena.
Mr. Lutz motioned to recommend approval of the Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for Joe
Louis Arena without a CAC public hearing and without appointing special members. Dr. Randall
seconded the motion. DBRA-CAC Resolution Code 18-10-256-02, recommending approval of the
Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for Joe Louis Arena was unanimously approved.
