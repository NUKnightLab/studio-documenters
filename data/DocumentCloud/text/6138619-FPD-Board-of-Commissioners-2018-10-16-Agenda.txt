PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
REQUEST TO REGISTER A PORTION OF WAMPUM LAKE AS AN ILLINOIS NATURE
PRESERVE
Department: Resource Management
Summary:

Requesting authority, pursuant to Section 9 of the Cook County Forest Preserve District Act

(70 ILCS 810/9), to register a portion of the Wampum Lake preserve as an Illinois Nature Preserve with
the Illinois Nature Preserve Commission (“INPC”).

Page 8 of 26

 FPD Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

October 16, 2018

This dedication contributes to one of the key goals set forward in the Next Century Conservation Plan to
dedicate and register 20,000 acres with the INPC by 2025. Dedication of a site as a Nature Preserve
provides the highest level of protection for land in Illinois, and is granted only to natural areas of important
natural and cultural significance.
The proposed Wampum Lake Nature Preserve is approximately a 380-acre portion of the preserves
located in the Village of Thornton in southeast Cook County. The site consists of unusual natural
communities such as sand seep, sand savanna, and open floodplain. The site also contains important
cultural resources which merit its dedication and protection. The Lake and groves will be excluded from
the nature preserve to ensure unfettered public access to those amenities.
The

Forest

Preserves of Cook County (the

“Forest

Preserves”)

currently

has 23 dedicated

Nature

Preserves and 4 Land and Water Reserves. The addition of Wampum Lake and all other proposed
dedications in 2018 would bring the Forest Preserves’ total INPC protected lands to approximately 8,400
acres.
It is respectfully requested that authority be granted to Forest Preserves to submit Wampum Lake to the
Illinois Nature Preserve Commission for review and formal dedication as an Illinois Nature Preserve.

Resources Master Plan, and to perform work pursuant to that plan on an annual basis. The Plan was
completed in early 2015, and has successfully helped guide the allocation of resources and informed
strategies to pursue and meet the ambitious goals set forth in the Next Century Conservation Plan.
The Forest Preserves’ continued partnership with the Prairie Research Institute has resulted in the

conservation success.
The proposed extension will enable the University of Illinois and the Forest Preserves to continue to
collaborate to meet the Forest Preserves’ needs for information and analysis in support of natural and
cultural resource management. Tasks will include, but are not limited to, the creation of web-based and
printed interpretive materials to provide easy-to-understand interpretation of science data that will engage
constituents and conservation partners. The University of Illinois will also assist the Forest Preserves with
advanced

land

cover

and

cultural

resource

mapping,

continued

field

assessments

of

archaeological

resources, and classification of priority waterways to remedy impacts to key conservation lands.
The Forest Preserves would like to extend the aforementioned IGA with the University of Illinois for an

REPORT
Department: Resource Management
Request: Receive and File
Report Title: Natural and Cultural Resources Master Plan 2018 Summary Report
Report Period: 10/2013 - 9/2018
Summary:

In October of 2013 the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the "Forest Preserves") partnered

with the University of Illinois's Prairie Research Institute ("PRI"), one of the state’s premier science
consortiums, for the purpose of developing a Natural and Cultural Resources Master Plan and providing
tools for its successful implementation. This document is a summary of the accomplishments of the Forest
Preserves’ five (5) year partnership with PRI.
Some of these accomplishments include, but are not limited to, the completion of the Natural and Cultural
Resources Master Plan in 2015, which described the historic and current status of both natural and
cultural resources in the Forest Preserves, identified threats to its resources, and provided options for
reducing the effects of those threats.
PRI also provided a broad set of tools for successful execution of the plan and effective resource
conservation into the future. Their science team assembled a detailed priority schematic for restoration,
authored the Forest Preserves’ first seed policy, and created a robust system for measuring success
toward conservation goals. PRI also devised a system for cataloging and prioritizing protection of our
cultural resources. While more work remains to be done, these efforts have positioned the Forest
Preserves to pursue and meet the ambitious goals set forth in the Next Century Conservation Plan.
