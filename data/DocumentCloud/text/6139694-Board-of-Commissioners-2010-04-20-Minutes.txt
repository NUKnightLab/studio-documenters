change caused by human emission of greenhouse gases is among the most significant problems facing the

opportunity to build a healthy, prosperous, clean energy economy now and for the future; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 20, 2010
WHEREAS, Mr. Tucker was born in Chicago in 1925 and enjoyed wearing two hats throughout his life:
Journalist by day and music composer by night; and although he hailed from a family of newspaper
people, “the occupation that most stirred his soul was writing music”; and
WHEREAS, after serving in the Army from 1943 to 1946 during World War II, Mr. Tucker started
working as a copy boy at the Chicago Sun before it merged with the Chicago Times in 1948. He later
was hired as an editorial writer at the Chicago American before going over to Chicago Today as editorial
page editor. He became a member of the editorial board at the Chicago Tribune in 1975, holding that
position for 13 years. Although he retired from the Tribune’s editorial board in 1988 to concentrate on
music, he wrote classical music reviews for the paper until 2003; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Tucker, at age 28, was so taken with the soundtrack of the ballet film, “The Red
Shoes,” that he resolved to become a composer. He enrolled at Chicago’s American Conservatory of
Music, where he eventually took bachelor’s and master’s degrees in piano and composition while writing
editorials for the Chicago American, which had hired him some years before; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Tucker composed numerous songs, choral works and three operas, the most successful
of which was “Many Moons” (1971-77), with libretto by Mr. Tucker based on a short story by James
Thurber. The opera had its premier in 1984 and was later performed at the Franz Liszt Academy of
Music in Budapest, Hungary; and

ballet and chamber groups have been heard across the U.S., Europe and South America. The Chicago
Symphony Orchestra, His Majesties’ Clerkes (now Bella Voce) and the Ars Viva Symphony are among
the Chicago groups that have performed his music; and
WHEREAS, at his Web site, Mr. Tucker stated his belief that, “the most interesting sounds are those that
share qualities of life- motion, direction, purpose. Musical works that ignore this life-detecting function
of hearing are unlikely to last beyond the stage of novelty;”
WHEREAS, Mr. Tucker will be forever fondly remembered by his many friends and colleagues as a
passionate, charming, warm and elegant, talented gentleman and good friend; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Tucker, a beloved and loving brother, uncle, husband, father, and grandfather will be
deeply missed by his family: devoted wife of 53 years, Margaret, a daughter, Ellen (Warren) Schoen, a
son, Andrew, and granddaughter, Jessica Schoen, brother of the late Ernest (Margaret) and John Irwin
(Charlotte) Tucker, his many nieces and nephews.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby offer its deepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathy to the family and friends of Dan Tucker
and joins them in sorrow at this time of loss; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official

Your Committee has considered the following items and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
303349

RECORDER OF DEEDS, Eugene “Gene” Moore, transmitting a Communication, dated
September 30, 2009:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Fidlar
Technologies, Inc., Rock Island, Illinois, for the property Fraud Alert system, the Disaster
Recovery System and the Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program. The Property Fraud Alert
system will serve as an early notification for Cook County property owners, allowing them to
intervene in the event of fraudulent transactions. The Disaster Recovery System will allow
the office to resume operating within hours of any interruption of service, whether natural or
otherwise. The Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program is expected to increase revenue from the
sale of Recorder of Deeds information beyond the current levels.
Reason:
Fidlar Technologies, Inc. provides the industry's only proactive land fraud
notification system that functions in harmony with third party recording systems. The system
requires no additional modifications to existing Recorder of Deeds operation. The Fidlar
Disaster Recovery system feeds the Tapestry/Laredo Data Sales program with recorded
information, which provides an additional level of network security for the Recorder of
Deeds office.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $322,000.00 (FY 2009: $131,613.00; and FY 2010: $190,387.00).

Technology, provide an overview of this matter.
Mr. Edmonson requested that Mary Jo Horace, Director of the Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
Department, Cook County Bureau of Technology, address this matter.
Ms. Horace stated that this bid would enable the Cook County Bureau of Technology to be able to do
online training with its land information groups and to do presentations for all County agencies that share
documents within geographic information systems; this can be done remotely over the County’s intranet.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of Communication
No. 305990. The motion carried.
305991

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY, by R. STEVE EDMONSON, Chief Information Officer,
transmitting a Communication, dated March 11, 2010:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into an intergovernmental
agreement with U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (USGS) and NATIONAL
GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (NGA) for urban areas of Chicago and

71

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 20, 2010
Urbana, Illinois, for the acquisition of Orthoimagery photography for the Chicago, Illinois
footprint defined as part of the Federal 133 Urban Areas Program.
Reason:

As part of a regional project for the acquisition of aerial imagery for data
acquisition and sharing at county borders, regional partners, Cook, DuPage,
Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties as well as the Chicago
Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the United States Geological Survey have
agreed to contribute financially for the cost of the project. This project also
supports the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) by advancing USGS
and Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) efforts related to Geospatial
One-Stop, The National Map, and Imagery for the nation. Since Cook County
has the largest, most complex territory in the region composed of dense urban
areas, airports and shore line environments, it is acting as the lead government
project manager for the initiative. The joint purchasing agreement with U.S
Geological Survey and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency will allow us to
receive their $200,000.00 funding for the project.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Estimated Revenue generating: Geographic Information
System (GIS) will receive $200,000.00. Contract period: May 1, 2010 through April 30,
2011. (545-260 Account).
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on 04/06/10,
as Amended.
Ms. Horace stated the following: The County Board approved a fly-over for part of a regional GIS
project with the following counties: DuPage, Kane, Kendall, McHenry and Will. As part of that project,
which will supply aerial photography over the northeastern geographic area, the U.S. Geospatial Survey
has contacted us and stated that they are willing to submit funding to Cook County for the project as well.
In order to comply, Ms. Horace needs to demonstrate that she has the County Board’s support for
applying and receiving funding for this project. After she receives approval from the County Board she
will complete the application process, and will then return to the County Board for final execution of the
contract with the U.S. Geological Survey.
Commissioner Daley inquired as to what the goal of this project is.
Ms. Horace replied that the fly-over is done every year, and is utilized in the County’s map making
process.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of Communication
No. 305991, as amended. The motion carried.
305992

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY, by R. Steve Edmonson, Chief Information Officer,
transmitting a Communication, dated March 11, 2010:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into an intergovernmental
agreement with LAKE COUNTY, ILLINOIS, for the acquisition of Orthoimagery for the
Northeastern Illinois region.
Reason:

As part of a regional project for the acquisition of aerial imagery for data
acquisition and sharing at county borders, regional partners, Cook, DuPage,
Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties as well as the Chicago

72

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 20, 2010
Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the United States Geological Survey have
agreed to contribute financially for the cost of the project. Since Cook County
has the largest, most complex territory in the region composing of dense urban
areas, airports and shoreline environments, it is acting as the lead government
project manager for this initiative. The joint purchasing intergovernmental
agreement with Lake County will allow us to receive their 1st year funding for the
project.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Estimated Revenue generating: Geographic Information
System (GIS) will receive $100,346.64 for 2010. Contract period: February 22, 2010
through August 21, 2011. (545-260 Account).
*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on 04/06/10,
as Amended.
Mary Jo Horace stated: This is the start of a contract with Lake County, Illinois in order to receive
$100,000 in funding from them this year toward the regional aerial project. Some government agencies,
including Lake County, require authorization from the County Board before they will send a contract and
agreement.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of Communication
No. 305992, as amended. The motion carried.
305993

BUREAU OF TECHNOLOGY – TRANSFER OF FUNDS.
Transmitting a
Communication, dated March 11, 2010 from R. Steve Edmonson, Chief Information Officer:
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $425,000.00
from Account 545-260, Professional and Managerial Services to Account 545-441,
Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment and Software for the coverage of a
contract for ground imagery maintenance which includes acquisition of parcel images,
ground control, data collection and Federal Geographic Data Committee compliance
metadata Board approved on December 15, 2009.
Reason:

The transfer is needed to cover funding that was originally budgeted for 2009,
but due to contract processing, the contract period was moved to 2010.

From Account:
545-260

Total $425,000.00

To Account:
545-441
1.

Total $425,000.00

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an
infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the
account on that date, and what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On February 22, 2010, it became apparent that the Maintenance and Repair of Data
Processing Equipment and Software Account 545-441 would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet outstanding maintenance obligations. At this time, the balance

73

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 20, 2010
of the account had $422,812.00, not including the outstanding contract expenditures
of $475,650.00.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any
other accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the
transferred funds.
Account 545-260 was identified as the source of transferred funds because of the
reduction of some of the geospatial projects which was realized via the Request for
Proposal process and cooperative acquisitions on a regional level.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be
deferred, delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending
authority that will result in the account that funds are transferred from 545-260
Professional Services.
Savings in the account will occur in two ways:

4.

1)

Since the County Board authorized us to participate in a regional aerial
Orthoimagery project with the seven neighboring counties, the Chicago
Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the United States Geological Survey,
we realized a projected savings of over $300,000.00.

2)

The department will postpone the upgrade of an existing application,
Mapviewer that County agencies use internally to quickly produce map
displays.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account
was originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at
this point in the fiscal year.
The funding for the contract was originally planned to be incurred as part of fiscal
year 2009. However due to the lengthy process of contract review and negotiations
and the end of the year account closeout, the contract funding was carried into the
2010 fiscal year budget. The timing of the contract processing was too late to add the
contract into the 2010 fiscal budget and not finalized enough to have the funds
encumbered from 2009.

*Referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation on 04/06/10 as
Amended.
Ms. Horace stated: The transfer of funds is needed to ensure that the GIS Department has funding for all
of its projects this year. One GIS Department project went before the County Board in 2009, but the
contract negotiations continued into 2010. The funding was initially for 2009. The GIS Department will
have funding for this project because of the revenue which the GIS Department will be receiving from
other government agencies who are working with the GIS Department.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of Communication
No. 305993, as amended. The motion carried.

74

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 20, 2010
Commissioner Goslin moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Schneider. The

305025

STEPHEN S. MORRILL, MORRILL & ASSOCIATES, P.C. (PROPOSED
CONTRACT). Transmitting a Communication, dated February 4, 2010 from Todd H.
Stroger, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with STEPHEN S.
MORRILL OF MORRILL & ASSOCIATES, P.C., whose name I am submitting for
consideration as a county lobbyist. Mr. Morrill will serve for a period of eleven ten months
beginning February 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010 November 30, 2010 in the amount of
$65,000.00 $59,091.00.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $65,000.00 $59,091.00. Contract period: February 1, 2010
through December 31, 2010 November 30, 2010. (018-260 Account). Requisition No.
100180012.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2010 funds.
*Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations on
02/09/10.

Derek Blaida, Special Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs, delivered brief remarks.
Mr. Blaida stated the Governor proposed a budget with a projected $13.5 billion short fall. Inclusive is a
proposed cut to one of the most important streams of revenue to municipalities, the local municipal
distributor fund. The cut would mean a 30% reduction of Cook County’s distribution and the lobbyist
will work diligently to keep Cook County’s funds. Mr. Blaida indicated the state will attempt to hold the
County harmless as much as possible.
Vice-Chairman Silvestri inquired about the state income tax year in relation to the proposed State budget.
Mr. Blaida stated in Fiscal year 2008, he believed the unincorporated areas of the County, received
approximately $99 per person. This year, the County will receive approximately $77 per person because
of falling income tax rates. The Governor’s proposed budget, if adopted on its face, would drop to $51 per
person which would reduce the County distribution from about $10.5 million to a little over $7.1 million a reduction of $3.4 million.
Commissioner Daley requested that Mr. Blaida track any bills that would have an impact on the County’s
unfunded mandates and stipulated that these bills should be seriously monitored. Mr. Blaida stated that he
would provide a report on these bills. In addition, Chairman Suffredin stated that there are other
appropriation bills for the Boot Camp and funds for the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center that the
County has got to fight for because they are not in the Governor’s proposed budget at this point.
Chairman Suffredin requested Stephen S. Morrill, Morrill & Associates to provide brief remarks
regarding pension and other budgetary issues. Mr. Morrill, provided a report detailing bills pending in the
96th Illinois General Assembly that affect the Cook County (see attachment #1) which includes the
pension reform bill. Mr. Morrill state the pension reform bill passed and affects both of the County’s
pension funds.
Chairman Suffredin stated that Cook County now has the only law enforcement with a retirement age of
67 because Chicago and downstate police/fire funds were exempted from the bill. Mr. Blaida added that

76

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 20, 2010
there is no early retirement bill. In addition, Chairman Suffredin asked the State’s Attorney to provide the
County with a legal opinion regarding other aspects of this bill, as well as a legal opinion on a document
that the law firm, Sidley Austin LLP., distributed through the Commercial Club of Chicago. The Sidley
Austin LLP document states that the County has the right to diminish pension benefits for current County
employees’ future earned benefits. Commissioner Gainer indicated she would welcome a clarification
from the State’s Attorney Office.
In closing, Chairman Suffredin stated that Mr. Blaida will provide the summary of the pension bill.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to accept the amendment for
Communication No. 305025.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy moved the approval of
Communication No. 305026 as amended. The motion carried.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent on March 29, 2010 that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet obligations of the new Electronic Monitoring Services contract that included
an unexpected price increase. On this date the balance of the account was $280,404.00 and 30 days
prior the balance was $280,404.00.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account (211-449) was identified for this transfer of funds because of an unanticipated surplus
in this account. This account was expected to be used to fund the maintenance cost for the
Cashiering System upgrade. However, due to minor setbacks, the “go live” date of the system was
postponed until the fall of 2010, funds for maintenance will be less than anticipated for FY 2010.
Additionally, the Sheriff’s Office received a reimbursement for 2009 radio maintenance costs from
the Forest Preserve District of Cook County that was credited to the FY 2010 account.
The account (215-330) was identified due to unanticipated surplus funds. This surplus is due
primarily to a change in the specifications for toilet paper/paper towels. This contract is expected to
be awarded for nearly half the previous year’s cost.
The account (236-298) was identified due to unanticipated surplus funds. This surplus is the result
of a review of the contract for substance abuse treatment. This review conducted by the current
vendor, received in the third week of February 2010, revealed that there would be an unbilled
surplus in this contract of approximately $217,000.00 for FY 2010. This is primarily due to the fact
that the average length of stay for most day reporting unit participants is shorter than originally
projected.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There is nothing that will be deferred, delayed, or cancelled as a result of the reduction in accounts
211-449, 215-330 or 236-298.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account (211-449) has a surplus because the maintenance cost of the cashiering system will be less
than anticipated for FY 2010 and a credit from the Forest Preserve District of Cook County for FY
2009 charges. Account (215-330) has a surplus due to the fact that the toilet paper/paper towel
contract for the Sheriff’s Custodial Department is expected to be awarded for significantly less than
the previous year’s cost. Account (236-298) has a surplus due to the fact that the fact that the
average length of stay for a day reporting unit participant is shorter than originally projected.

Human Services as part of their Illinois Disaster Assistance Program, for the provision of
mold remediation and home repair/maintenance services to residents of Cook County
impacted by the flooding that occurred from September 13, 2008 to October 5, 2008.
The Illinois Department of Human Services has indicated that, in order to satisfy the
expectations of the State of Illinois, Cook County is required to demonstrate significant
progress to the State. At least $500,000/week needs to be committed, over the next five
months, in order to satisfy the terms of the contract and the grant.
This grant, commonly referred to as the Cook County Disaster Grant also provides
funding for the reimbursement of agencies that have provided health-related and other
social services to victims impacted by disaster declared flooding areas and is further
intended to provide funding to assist Cook County with making its communities and
residents whole in terms of health, safety and welfare activities.
Through the County’s efforts over 450 applications have been received under the Cook
County Disaster Grant and over 400 applicants have already been personally visited in
their homes by Cook County Disaster Grant staff to determine eligibility. The
Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management continues to receive
applications for assistance daily, and has a number of events scheduled, in partnership
with various townships and municipalities, to further advertise this grant.
In order to move forward and provide reimbursement to the social service agencies and
local municipalities, to authorize and begin construction, repairs and/or maintenance to
the eligible applicants, to make payment for services executed or products provided and
to perform all other services authorized under the grant, it is hereby requested that the
Executive Director of the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and
Emergency Management, or his designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the
County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to further the grant project approval,
including, but not limited to, any payments, sub-grantee agreements and contracts with
townships, municipalities, social service agencies and individual applicants.
It is further requested that said authorization include the authority to execute, on behalf of
the County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to further the grant project
approval, including, but not limited to any payments, sub-grantee agreements and
contracts with the Planning and Community Development Department’s pre-approved
regional agencies and vendors in order to engage their services as it relates to home
repair, maintenance and/or construction.
