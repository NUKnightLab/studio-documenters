BOARD ACTIONS
1.
S-CB-04-004
Robert J. Tipsword/Illinois Federation of Public Employees, Local 4408, AFT, AFL- CIO

Chairman Gallagher noted for the record that this case involved the public employee division of the AFT
and that she had previously been affiliated with the CTU, a subdivision of the AFT, unrelated to the
instant matter. Thereafter, General Counsel Zimmerman began by summarizing the case, noting that
Administrative Law Judge William Waechter concluded that the Union had failed in its duty of fair
representation, in violation of Section 10(b)(1)of the Act. In its exceptions, the Union argued that
Charging Party had no standing to bring the charge and secondly, that the charge lacked merit. The Board
engaged in a general discussion of the facts and evidence presented in the case. At the conclusion thereof,
Chairman Gallagher called for a motion to decide the matter. Member Taylor made a motion to accept
the recommendation of the Administrative Law Judge. Member Piper seconded the motion. The Board
passed the motion unanimously, by a voice vote.

 2.
S-CA-04-071
Illinois Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council/Village of River Forest
General Counsel Zimmerman began by summarizing the case. The Administrative Law Judge dismissed
the complaint because the charge was untimely filed. Charging Party alleged that Respondent Employer
violated Section 10(a)(4) and (1) of the Act, in that it eliminated a police lieutenant position from the unit
without bargaining. The General Counsel agreed with the Administrative Law Judge's recommendation,
finding that the Union was on notice in May 2002, that the lieutenant position was to be eliminated, and
that the six-month statute of limitations began to run at that time. Accordingly, the Administrative Law
Judge recommended that the charge, filed in September 2003, was untimely. Member Piper moved that
the Board accept the Administrative Law Judge's recommendation. Member Taylor seconded the motion.
The Board passed the motion unanimously, by a voice vote.

VI.

The Board then discussed certain pending litigation and the text of its recent decision involving the
