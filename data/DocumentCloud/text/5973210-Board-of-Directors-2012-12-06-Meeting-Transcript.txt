CHAIRMAN BELL:

Good morning.

I'd like

to call the meeting to order.

3

Thank you all for coming out and

4

sharing your time with us as we work our way

5

through this.

6

a process with the City, helping to improve this

7

great City in a way that we would not only make

8

wonderful for the existing citizens but to

9

encourage others to come join us.

10

We've made very, very good progress,

As you see, we have a pretty full

11

agenda.

It was posted on the web site, so I hope

12

you've all had an opportunity to take a look at it

13

and the members also.

14

Now, it's broken up into some

15

administrative matters we just have to get through,

16

but the bulk of this meeting we're going to spend

17

on walking through the retrofit project that the

18

City is working on.

19

As you can see, we have

20

presentations by some of the stakeholders.

21

going to walk through that and discuss both where

22

we stand in the process and then how we're going to

23

move forward.

24

We're

With that, I'm just going to jump

 3
1

right in with the organizational matters and start

2

with the approval of the minutes.

3

provided to us.

4

we've all read them.

5
6

They're on the web site.

I think

Any comments, any additions,
adjustments, corrections?

7

(No response.)

8

Do I hear a motion?

9

MR. RAMIREZ:

Motion.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So moved.

Second.

13

All in favor.
(A chorus of ayes.)

14
15

The minutes were

All right.

So the minutes are

accepted.

16

Next on the agenda is approval of

17

the bylaws.

18

turn it over to David.

19

what they are, and then we can vote on the motion.

20

We had a few revisions.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm going to

He can sort of characterize

So I think all the Board

21

members have met Scott Falk and Henry Kleeman who

22

are partners at Kirkland & Ellis who have been

23

assisting us pro bono.

24

bylaws and a variety of other things.

They've spent time on these
We're very

 4
1

appreciative of their time that they've been

2

spending and donating to us and the public on this.

3

So they took a look at the bylaws

4

that were passed early in our life and pointed out

5

a variety of minor corrections that need to be

6

made, all of which I agree with.

7

red line version what those changes are, and the

8

only two that are of any note at all in my mind is

9

that on Page 8 there's an additional Article 8

You'll see in the

10

that's added which has some basic statements about

11

officers of the Trust to distinguish between

12

officers of the Board as we appointed at the first

13

meeting, so the fact that the Trust itself on the

14

staff level will have, will have at least one

15

officer -- the executive director.

16

others as we decide, so that was standard but

17

something that was missing in our prior ones.

18

And then on Page 11 there's an

It may have

19

article on indemnification, and they made in their

20

experience, and I agree with them, some proper

21

changes to the terminology and deleted some

22

unnecessary provisions that were inconsistent with

23

the Not-For-Profit Act of the State of Illinois

24

about indemnification.

 5
1

Otherwise, the changes are either

2

cosmetic or minor, and so let me ask, Scott and

3

Henry, any other comments other than what I've said

4

on this?

5

MR. FALK:

6

MR. KLEEMAN:

No.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Any questions from the

8

No.

Board?

9

(No response.)

10

I move the admission of this.

11

think these are proper changes to our bylaws.

12

ALDERMAN POPE:

Second.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor.

14

(A chorus of ayes.)

15

All right.

16

the bylaws were approved.

17

I

So the record will show

You might notice that on the agenda

18

we did have announcement of Advisory Board Members.

19

We are going to postpone that to January, and quite

20

frankly, it's only because I didn't realize that we

21

had -- The Advisory Board Members have to meet some

22

of the same requirements that we, the Board

23

members, have to meet in terms of ethics and

24

conduct, and it's only because we have not had an

 6
1

opportunity to talk to them about that.

2

think it would be an issue, but we do think we

3

should do that and let them make those commitments

4

before announcing the names.

5

I don't

The point is -- From the City's

6

point we've already done it.

7

it's half a Board, so we're going to wait until

8

January.

9

at that time.

10

Now

We'll announce the total Advisory Board

Any questions on that?

11
12

It's pointless.

(No response.)
Moving on to reports.

I'll start

13

with the status of the Executive Director search.

14

Spencer Stuart has done a wonderful job getting

15

this out, getting widespread notification, getting

16

it out to the public, and we've had a tremendous

17

response to this position.

18

We have a selection committee

19

assisting us, Diana, Jorge and I.

We have gone

20

through and met with Spencer Stuart and went

21

through all the candidates, made the first cut down

22

to the top seven which we will be interviewing over

23

the next couple of days hopefully to get down to

24

the top three to bring back to the Board and

 7
1

recommend a decision be made as to who that is, and

2

we're hopeful to try to keep that into this year if

3

all goes well, but we're working hard to get that

4

done.

5

are, and Spencer Stuart has just done a tremendous

6

job of getting some very, very qualified people for

7

us to consider.

But that's where we stand.

8

Any comments, questions?

9

(No response.)

10
11

That's where we

MR. HOFFMAN:

I concur that they've

done a good job so far.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

13

Done wonderful work.

14

Okay.

It's been wonderful.

With that, we'll move on to

15

the status of our directors and officers liability

16

insurance.

17

Diana.

18

MS. FERGUSON:

19

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Our process has gone well so far

20

with respect to seeking our directors and officers

21

liability insurance.

22

We've retained as our broker Risk

23

Strategies.

They are a broker that is experienced

24

in the area of executive risk insurance.

And I

 8
1

didn't see John here.

Oh, there you are.

2

Represented by John Morgan and his colleague Mark

3

Madigan are here from Risk Strategies.

4

serving as our broker on behalf of the Trust.

5

We have provided a preliminary

They are

6

application which they are using to approach

7

potential underwriters.

8

responding to underwriter inquiries, follow-up

9

questions and providing additional final data.

10

We are in the process of

We expect to have terms from

11

potential underwriters in the coming days and will

12

give a report at the next meeting, the full

13

recommendation in terms of limits and the cost to

14

the Trust, but the process is going well, and we

15

appreciate the services of Risk Strategies.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17
18
19
20

Thank you, Diane.

Any questions of the Board?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Do you have a sense of the

life of the -MS. FERGUSON:

Based on where we are in

21

the process, I believe that we will have

22

preliminary terms as early as next week.

23

negotiation of finalizing those terms and making

24

sure that we have the most competitive pricing and

Then the

 9
1

going to contract could take until the next

2

meeting, so I think it will come over the next

3

week.

I'll defer to our broker.

4

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's accurate.

So hopefully by the next

6

meeting we'll have authorization and we can report

7

on that.

8

MS. FERGUSON:

That's right.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you very much,

10

Diana, for your work on that.

11

Moving on to the action items, the

12

banking relationships, Diana has been working with

13

PFM to establish a banking relationship for the

14

Trust.

15
16

Diana, why don't you let us know
where we are on that?

17

MS. FERGUSON:

Sure.

In October of

18

this year, our financial advisor PFM acting on our

19

behalf issued a request for proposal for banking

20

services.

21

were pre-approved by the Treasurer's and the

22

Comptroller's Offices as well as the Chicago City

23

Council as approved municipal depositories.

24

banks include Albany Bank & Trust, Amalgamated,

That RFP went to a list of banks that

Those

 10
1

Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase, CitiBank, Cole

2

Taylor, Fifth Third, First Eagle Bank, BMO Harris,

3

Illinois Service Federal, Pacific Global, PNC, U.S.

4

Bank and Seaway.

5

In addition to distributing an RFP

6

to the banks referenced above, the RFP was also

7

posted on the CIT web site so that it had broad

8

distribution.

9

to the RFP and evaluated the proposals based on the

We received a total of six responses

10

following criteria:

11

experience, financial strength, compliance with the

12

requirements of the RFP, quality of the proposal

13

and, of course, fees.

14

Operational requirements, firm

PFM professionals who have

15

experience with banks and banking relationships

16

participated in the review of proposals

17

independently and completed evaluation score sheets

18

on each proposal.

19

The highest scoring proposal was

20

received from U.S. Bank.

In addition, U.S. Bank

21

presented the most competitive fee proposal, so we

22

feel really comfortable that in addition to

23

providing, being the most responsive in terms of

24

their proposal, they are also the lowest cost.

 11
1

Based on that, I am recommending

2

that we select U.S. Bank as our banking partner and

3

open that for discussion amongst the Board.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You might also mention

5

the fact we might have eliminated some of the

6

proposals due to potential conflict.

7

MS. FERGUSON:

One of the responses

8

that we received was from JP Morgan Chase.

We made

9

the decision to eliminate them from consideration

10

because of Chairman Bell's association with JP

11

Morgan Chase on their board, so they were

12

eliminated from consideration not based on their

13

proposal but because of the conflict.

14

MR. RAMIREZ:

This is Director Ramirez.

15

I'm not going to be voting on this matter.

16

director of the board of Amalgamated Bank at least

17

through the end of this year.

18

board effective December, end of December.

19
20
21
22
23
24

I'm

I'll be off the

I wasn't aware that they were one of
the finalists.
MS. FERGUSON:

They were not.

They

were one of the originals who -MR. RAMIREZ:
eliminated.

So they were already

 12
1
2

MS. FERGUSON:

They did not respond.

They were not one of the respondents.

3

With that, are there any questions?

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

5

MR. RAMIREZ:

Disregard it.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Was this -- Was U.S. Bank

7

PFM's recommendation for us?

8
9

Any other questions?

MR. MORSCH:

My name is Tom Morsch from

PFM.

10

It was based on, as Diana indicated,

11

both the evaluation proposals as well as the most

12

competitive fee proposal.

13
14

MR. HOFFMAN:

That evaluation was done

by PFM?

15

MR. MORSCH:

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.
So after that evaluation

17

process was it PFM's recommendation that we select

18

U.S. Bank?

19

MR. MORSCH: Yes.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

And can you, either

21

you or PFM, just give us a quick summary of what

22

they'll be doing for us, like what the banking

23

services are that we're asking for?

24

imagine that it means that's where we'll have bank

I mean I

 13
1

accounts.

2

whether there's anything -- What it means that

3

we're -- How we're going to use this bank.

4

But I just really wanted to flush out

MS. FERGUSON:

At its most basic level

5

we need to have, for lack of a better or more

6

elegant way to describe it, a checking account so

7

that we can receive funds, disburse funds, in the

8

event that we have excess cash, make, invest those

9

funds, excess funds in accordance with an

10

investment policy, have a payroll once we hire

11

staff, things like that, so administer the

12

financial transactions of the Trust in accordance

13

with our governance and bylaws.

14
15
16

MR. HOFFMAN:

So this is simply where

we're going to have our bank account?
MS. FERGUSON:

Yeah.

This is just a

17

bank -- There is no expectation that this bank,

18

that U.S. Bank as our recommended provider would

19

have any additional competitive position with

20

respect to any transactions that we might consider,

21

anything like that.

22

services to the Trust as a checking account.

23
24

This is the service providing

ALDERMAN POPE:

They would not be

excluded from participating in other activities

 14
1

with the Trust?

2

MS. FERGUSON:

I don't anticipate that

3

they'd necessarily need to be excluded, but I don't

4

think that by serving as the Trust's banking

5

partner that they would necessarily have a more

6

competitive position.

7

ALDERMAN POPE:

Very good.

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Any other comments,

9

questions?

10
11

(No response.)
Do I have a motion?

12

MS. FERGUSON:

So moved.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Second.

15

All in favor.
(A chorus of ayes.)

16

All right.

17

The next item on the agenda is the

18
19
20
21

Done.

approval of the accounts payables.
Treasurer, do you have anything that
needs to be paid?
MS. FERGUSON:

Yes.

I am in receipt of

22

an invoice for the services of our court reporter

23

which is due, and because we now have a banking

24

partner available to help us execute the payment of

 15
1

that transaction I would submit it for

2

consideration of payment.

3

MR. RAMIREZ:

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

5

time.

I think she heard that.
It's probably about

Is that --

6

MS. FERGUSON:

Yes.

So --

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Listen, what's the

8

timing of when the 200 will get deposited?

9

will we open the account, the 200 gets deposited so

10

we can actually execute payment?

11

sense of that?

12

MR. FERGUSON:

When

Do you have a

Now that we have an

13

account, we have a funding strip.

14

question of walk it down to revenue and they should

15

be able to transfer the funds sometime in the next

16

week.

17
18

Now it's just a

Alderman Pope would have a handle on
that better.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

pay the court reporter --

Because we should really

21

(Laughter.)

22

-- before she cuts us off.

23
24

MS. FERGUSON:

Right.

So I'm not sure the protocol for

 16
1

approving this.

2

approve the payment or --

3
4

Do we need the full Board to

MR. HOFFMAN:

invoice and you recommend it?

5

MS. FERGUSON:

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

7

You've examined the

I am -- Yes.
So if we need a motion,

I'm happy to move to approve it.

8

I think in the future that to the

9

extent that we have bills that are of this

10

magnitude I'm happy to delegate that to the

11

Treasurer.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

13

MR. RAMIREZ:

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15
16

Yes.

Second.
So that's the motion.

You didn't know you -MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm sorry.

I move -- Let

17

me -- Two ways that you can take it.

18

the invoice, and one is to create a process where

19

we're delegating bills of a reasonable size for the

20

Treasurer to approve on her own.

21

So moved.

22

MR. RAMIREZ:

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

24

One is to pay

Second.
All in favor.
(A chorus of ayes.)

 17
1

Okay.

2

MS. FERGUSON:

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

4

So moved.
Thank you.
Now we'll get to the

meat of our agenda -- Retrofit Chicago update.

5

Lois, do you want to set it up or do

6

you want -- How do you want to do it?

7

David?

8

Whoever.

Scott?

Let's just get into it.

MR. WINTERS:

Mr. Ramirez, Mr. Chairman,

9

Alderman, Ms. Ferguson and Mr. Hoffman, on behalf

10

of Mayor Emanuel, our Chief Financial Officer Will

11

Scott and the Corporation Council, I'd like to

12

thank you all for your service to the City and for

13

working with us.

14

In my own opinion, I'll be clear

15

about that, it is my own opinion, I appreciate that

16

both Mayor Emanuel, Alderman Pope and the rest of

17

the City Council had the foresight and vision to

18

understand that what was needed here was not

19

another unit of local government but precisely a

20

consortium of leaders of the labor industry,

21

government, finance and the law to come together

22

and assist us in working with the private sector

23

for the benefit of the City, so thank you once

24

again.

 18
1
2

Our first purpose here this
morning --

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

4

comment.

5

record, please?

6

David, thank you for the

Would you introduce yourself for the

MR. WINTERS:

Oh, I'm sorry.

My name is

7

David Winters.

I'm the Chief Assistant Corporation

8

Counsel with the City of Chicago's Law Department,

9

and the reason I'm here among other things is

10

because the scope of my responsibilities these days

11

is that I am responsible for all the legal aspects

12

of all of the City's capital programs from the

13

beginning to dispute resolution.

14

that you have any questions about how it is that

15

our capital programs are developed, implemented,

16

litigated, resolved, what have you, I'll be happy

17

to answer those questions.

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

19
20

Thank you.

Can the folks in the back row hear
the speaker?

21

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23
24

So to the extent

Okay.

Thank you.

I'm sorry, David.
MR. WINTERS:

Yes.

Go ahead.

I generally don't use

 19
1

microphones.

2

it here and having the choice to face a blind

3

screen or to look at you, so hopefully I can

4

achieve both ends.

5

It's a little awkward standing with

One purpose that we have for coming

6

this morning and one of the many things that I do

7

do is work with, and I have been for the last 20

8

years, I've worked, first of all, and it's a point

9

worth making, that the concept of having private

10

entities by agreement comply with City laws is

11

nothing new.

12

Tech agreement -- CIA Tech, which was the

13

Consortium of International Airlines that funded

14

and worked on the international terminal with the

15

City, agreed to abide by the City's procurement law

16

in the procurement of the common use airline

17

equipment that they bought for T5 and sold for T5

18

and continued to operate at T5 at O'Hare, and I was

19

their counsel during the procurement and

20

construction of Terminal 5.

21

Twenty years ago under the City's CIA

From there I remained with the

22

City's Law Department where I was the director for

23

the City for the Midway Terminal Development

24

Program.

 20
1

I then went to the Department of

2

Procurement Services where I was the deputy

3

commissioner for the Midway terminal development

4

that they package out on the street which at the

5

time was the largest the City had.

6

From there I went to the MPEA where

7

I was responsible for the development and

8

construction of the corporate center conference

9

center and west expansion of McCormick Place.

I

10

returned to the City where I was responsible for

11

getting the construction program for the Pier

12

modernization program under way.

13

I then went to the Public Building

14

Commission as an outside counsel to work on schools

15

across Chicago and returned to the City to work on

16

infrastructure matters as I've described, so for

17

the past 20 years I've been doing public

18

procurement and infrastructure in particular.

19

We're asking you today to work with

20

us to issue an RFQ to the investment community, and

21

an RFQ is a request for formal qualifications.

22

We've had discussions amongst

23

ourselves and with your financial advisors and

24

legal advisors regarding the nomenclature.

We

 21
1

think a request for qualifications is appropriate

2

because we want the investment community to take

3

this as seriously as we do.

4

Quite often when the City goes out

5

on the street with a request for information,

6

request for interest, people take that as an

7

indication that we are just not prepared to do a

8

transaction, and we don't want to create that

9

impression.

We don't know -- And we're obviously

10

we're going to work with you to fill out the

11

precise terms of whatever transaction we enter

12

into, but we do have an idea of where we want to

13

go, and we intend to work with you and hopefully

14

work with you over the coming months to bring that

15

to fruition.

16

As far as the timing is concerned,

17

we're more than anxious to get this under way, but

18

at the same time we recognize the process that

19

needs to be undertaken so that you all are

20

comfortable, so that the public is knowledgeable

21

and everybody is proceeding on a common basis.

22

Again, we're more than willing and happy to work

23

with you towards that end.

24

The construct of the RFQ as we see

 22
1

it would be, first of all, to describe the Trust

2

since the Trust is the new player in the game --

3

The City's been around for a while -- describe the

4

City's projects that will be involved during the

5

initial outreach to the investment community, state

6

our objectives which include our policy objectives,

7

social objectives as well as our financial

8

objectives and state what we need to know at this

9

point from the investors which includes the

10

completion of the City's economic disclosure

11

statement.

12

The reason we mention that in

13

particular and put it upfront is because people

14

find it difficult and -- But it is required by law,

15

and our experience is the sooner people become

16

familiar with that and start working their way

17

through it with us the better off we all are.

18

have had transactions that come to an absolute halt

19

because of that.

20

We

And from here we expect as you know

21

to work with the Trust advisors to develop and

22

document the process hopefully within January but,

23

again, not before all of you are comfortable with

24

what it is that we intend to do.

 23
1

My colleagues from the City,

2

Commissioner David Reynolds from the Department of

3

Fleet and Facility Management, Commissioner Powers

4

from the Department of Water Management and then

5

our colleague from public schools Pat Taylor, the

6

Chief Operating Officer of CPS, are going to

7

present more details about each of their respective

8

projects.

9

I was going to give a brief overview

10

of the retrofit projects and the way our capital

11

programs are developed and why it is that these

12

particular projects are here before you and why

13

we're discussing those rather than other projects.

14

All of the City's capital programs

15

are a matter of public interaction.

16

clear about that from the get-go.

I want to be

17

Whether it's our commissioners out

18

there in meetings with the community, interacting

19

with aldermen, interacting with members of the

20

community or taking the reports that they get from

21

all of the consultants, engineers and so on that

22

work with them regarding the condition of each and

23

every sewer line, each and every water meter, each

24

and every school, public building, what have you in

 24
1

the City of Chicago, each and every day City people

2

are out there assessing the state of our

3

infrastructure and prioritizing the needs and

4

working with members of the community, leaders of

5

the community to decide what our priorities should

6

be.

7

Out of all of those what we've come

8

up with are a series of retrofit projects, and the

9

reason that we've selected these retrofit projects

10

is because, first of all, they offer a revenue

11

stream, and that makes them different from most of

12

our other projects.

13

By implementing new lighting and new

14

boilers, what have you in various facilities, we

15

achieve savings.

16

dedicated and paid into a trust, the Infrastructure

17

Trust in this case, so that the people that loan us

18

the money, whoever they may be, can get a return on

19

their investment over time.

20

the purpose.

21
22
23
24

These savings can then be

MR. HOFFMAN:
that.

And that simply put is

I'm sorry.

I didn't hear

That simply put is?
MR. WINTERS:

Is the purpose.

We can go into whatever level of

 25
1

detail you choose today or any other point

2

regarding how it is the savings are calculated.

3

colleagues will go into more detail about their

4

respective projects, but, as I said, for an

5

overview, that's where we are.

6

My

All of the City's projects as I'm

7

sure you are aware are brought before City Council

8

whether it's during the course of budget review or

9

for specific projects when it's warranted and

10

necessary but they're brought to Council for

11

approval.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

David, question.

I'm

13

just going to assume that the City or the other

14

agencies have processes in place --

15

MR. WINTERS:

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We do.
-- that these kinds of

17

projects get vetted and all of these have been

18

vetted via those processes.

19
20

MR. WINTERS:
statement.

21

Okay.

I'm glad you made that

I'll move on.

Another reason that we brought the

22

retrofit projects is because energy savings

23

contracts are well understood by the finance

24

community.

They're nothing new to them, and since

 26
1

the Trust itself is something new, rather than

2

bring in new thing after new thing with all of the

3

process, the effective notes, the mortgage to make

4

anything happen we thought it more prudent that

5

somebody from the marketplace already familiar with

6

it be brought forward.

7

We are going to look for some

8

innovations with respect to the structure of those

9

transactions, and our advisors are already familiar

10

with some of our costs in that regard.

We'll

11

continue to work with them and with you to question

12

those items as we go along.

13

The one other key factor for us as

14

far as the Trust is concerned is the transparency

15

that it brings to this process.

16

this conversation with Scott Falk in particular

17

regarding why it is that we see a single purpose

18

entity being formed by the Trust at some point in

19

the future to hold the Trust and stay from its

20

first round and infrastructure trust projects, and

21

there are good business reasons for it --

22

Remoteness from bankruptcy being foremost among

23

those.

24

another reason for that, but as far as the City's

I know I've had

Insulating the other assets of the Trust is

 27
1

concerned, as far as the governance are concerned,

2

we want the balance sheet to be as straightforward

3

as possible.

4

everybody to see.

5

Money in.

Money out.

Posted for

That's why we're doing it.

If you have any questions at this

6

point, I'd be happy to answer them.

7

I'll turn it over to Commissioner Reynolds who can

8

speak to --

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Otherwise,

Just a general question,

10

and I don't know if this should be before or after,

11

but, you know, why choose this source of funding

12

for these particular projects, why not the

13

traditional sources?

14

MR. WINTERS:

There's a lot of reasons.

15

One is, as I said, we have both from the Chicago

16

Public Schools and the City Clerk coordinating

17

between agencies transaction costs for all

18

agencies, and that's part of the purpose.

19

it visible is another reason.

20

Yes, we can have all of this within the

21

complications of our entire City budget, and people

22

if they work hard enough work their way through all

23

of that, but, like I said, part of the point is

24

this stand-by-itself policy and understanding

Making

Yes, it can go out.

 28
1

its (inaudible).

2

ALDERMAN POPE:

3

David, thank you.

In the handout that we have before

4

us, I don't know if you're going to show that on

5

the power point, there's some specific information

6

in terms of the draft terms sheet in terms of

7

putting it in perspective.

8

of those or remind us of that?

Could you address some

9

MR. WINTERS:

10

financial advisors speak to that.

11
12

Actually, I'll let our

ALDERMAN POPE:
great.

13

I think that would be

That would put it in perspective.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Before you leave can I ask

14

a question about what's going to happen next, the

15

process here?

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

Who are we hearing from?

18

I just want to sort of figure out when I want to

19

ask questions.

20

I gather we're going to hear from other City

21

people?

I want to be efficient about this.

22

MR. WINTERS:

Yes.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Who are we hearing from

24

next?

 29
1

MR. WINTERS:

Commissioner Reynolds.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

Then were you anticipating

3

that someone with the CFO's Office or financial

4

advisors were also coming or up just as we have

5

questions?

6
7
8
9

MR. WINTERS:

Just as you have

MR. HOFFMAN:

Because what I'm thinking

questions.

is that at some -- I'd be happy to dive in with

10

questions to him now.

I was also thinking, Mr.

11

Chairman, as we discussed that at some point I

12

wanted to have questions as well for our advisors.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Absolutely.

I'd love to sort of do it

15

when David's up here.

16

efficient to sort of have more of a discussion but

17

I don't want to be -- I don't want to get in the

18

way of what our process is today.

19

I think that makes it

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, we have the part

20

about the next steps after the presentations.

We

21

could do it then, all of it, or we could do it at

22

the -- after the presentations.

23

whichever we think is -- You can get more specifics

24

on your questions.

I mean I think

I think all of the presenters

 30
1

are going to stay until the end.

2

MR. WINTERS:

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Is that correct?

That's correct.
Why don't we try to do

4

it at the end.

5

you have some questions on the specific

6

presentation then ask those, but at the end it

7

probably would be better if we just went through

8

all of these concerns.

9

I mean let's get through -- Unless

MR. HOFFMAN:

10

Fine.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And get our advisors,

11

both the financial and legal, to just come up and

12

help us work our way through those answers.

13
14

MS. FERGUSON:

Can I follow up on a

point?

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

MS. FERGUSON:

Absolutely.
If it's addressed later,

17

it's fine, but something you said sparked a

18

question for me which is -- I agree with you that

19

there are precedent type of transactions for these

20

energy efficient type retrofit projects.

21

curious to know what precedent transaction, if any,

22

you are referencing when you crafted the term sheet

23

for this and you specifically mentioned that you're

24

seeking some innovations versus the term, the

I'd be

 31
1

precedent transaction, so I'd be really curious for

2

those to be culled out so that we understand where

3

we're charting new territory and where we are.

4

MR. WINTERS:

Courtney can get into

5

those details with respect to the innovations.

As

6

far as what we're referencing, one immediate

7

project that comes to mind is the Daley Center.

8

has gone through a retrofit process with an energy

9

saving company -- ESCO Planning Transaction.

It

This

10

is a project that's been very successful.

11

what I understand the Daley Center is one of the

12

greener 40-year old buildings out there because of

13

that retrofit process.

14

MS. FERGUSON:

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

From

Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I have a

16

whole bunch of questions on a lot of the things he

17

said, but I'm happy to wait, but I also was

18

thinking I would address at least some of those --

19

I was going to address those questions to a mix of

20

David and our advisors and I'm happy to wait until

21

the end.

22
23
24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Do them when you're

comfortable.
MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm fully comfortable

 32
1

waiting.

2

that's acceptable to everybody --

3

MR. WINTERS:

That's fine with me.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- get through all the

5

City presentations and then we can ask questions.

6
7

I just wanted to -- If that's a process

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's fine with me.

Okay.

8

MR. WINTERS:

9

MS. SHEA:

10

I'm with Kish Financial Group.

11

advisor to the City's Department of Finance on this

12

particular transaction.

13

Courtney.

My name is Courtney Shea.
I'm the financial

In response to Ms. Ferguson's

14

question, while we're trying to set this up, both

15

the CHA and the Chicago Public Schools have done

16

extensive retrofit projects, and there has been a

17

way of doing this that basically the ESCO or the

18

opposite party basically came in, guaranteed the

19

savings and then they were paid back.

20

Our transaction is groundbreaking in

21

one respect because as you know the City ordinance

22

allows for at this point finance only, and the

23

agencies themselves as well as the City would

24

continue to not only own but maintain the project

 33
1

through the course of it, and it would be for

2

financing only.

3

what has been done in the past.

4
5

It's a little bit different than

If you would -CHAIRMAN BELL:

Meaning that what's been

6

done in the past is the people that provide the

7

financing may also do the retrofit work?

8

MS. SHEA:

Yes, exactly, and they

9

guarantee the retrofit.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

If you don't mind,

11

Mr. Chairman, I just would like to ask a couple of

12

questions just to clarify because when you use

13

phrases or words like the transaction, I just want

14

to tell you what I think my understanding and our

15

understanding is of where we are in the process

16

because I wouldn't want the word transaction to

17

communicate that we're farther ahead than where we

18

are, so I'm confident we're all on the same page.

19

Let me just lay out what I think

20

we're talking about here.

As David Winters said, I

21

think what we're talking about here is the

22

development between the City and its advisors along

23

with our advisors, PFM and Kirkland, of a document

24

that -- It's undecided exactly what it will be

 34
1

called, but it will either be called an RFQ or an

2

RFQ and something as David laid out, and the

3

purpose of that document will be to ask for

4

qualifications from potential financial investors

5

and also to request information from the

6

marketplace so that the City and the Trust are as

7

well educated as possible about what should be the

8

terms of a future RFP and that that RFP, once

9

that's issued and we get proposals on that, will

10

end up being the transaction, so that's -- My

11

understanding is that there's a process that --

12

Seems a very constructive process where you as the

13

City's financial advisor and the City officials and

14

our financial advisors and legal advisors are

15

talking to develop that first document that might

16

be called an RFQ and that at some point that would

17

be brought to us and the public for our

18

consideration maybe next month.

19

--

20

MS. SHEA:

So a little bit of

Perhaps I should have used

21

contemplated transaction but as far as -- At least

22

the way we've been referring to it as we've been

23

speaking to each of the three departments, we've

24

been referring to it as Retrofit 1 as a transaction

 35
1

for purposes of the Trust.

2

used the word contemplated.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Perhaps I should have

That's fine.

What I just

4

laid out, does that seem accurate to you about

5

where we are in the process?

6

MS. SHEA:

Yes.

Exactly.

If you look

7

at the handout that you've received, I think we

8

walked through in rather painstaking detail exactly

9

what it is we're trying to accomplish.

Basically,

10

as David said, the goal for this request is to

11

gauge market interest, to make sure that as your

12

advisor Mr. Morsch put it that it is a transaction

13

that has value and is marketable.

14

Secondly, we want to establish a

15

pool of people who are actually interested in

16

working with your advisors, the City's advisors to

17

make sure that we can bring a transaction to

18

fruition, that we are putting terms in and

19

conditions in that people will actually be able to

20

live up to and establish a foundation for the

21

bidding process.

22

This is the first of many

23

transactions we hope to bring to the Trust, but we

24

want to establish a repeatable process going

 36
1

forward so that we don't have to basically reinvent

2

the wheel every time we do this.

3

We want to encourage maximum

4

participation.

5

want to point out is this is a request for

6

qualification information.

7

One of the things that I really

We want to use the word

8

qualification because we want people to be engaged.

9

We want people to tell us what's actually important

10

for them to work with the Trust.

We don't want

11

this to be merely an exercise.

12

the broadest base of people we can -- banks,

13

pension funds, labor funds, charitable foundations,

14

infrastructure investors, socially responsible

15

investors.

We want to attract

16

But we also want to make sure that

17

the people who are responding are willing to live

18

up to many of the important things that the City

19

has put in the Ordinance -- for example, women and

20

minority participation, basically making sure that

21

they're ethically correct in their lobbying, the

22

EDS as David mentioned.

23

But in addition to that, we want to

24

make sure that we're innovative and we're bringing

 37
1

the best transformative transaction to the Trust.

2

David went through briefly what

3

we're going to do in the RFQ.

4

going to describe the investment opportunity.

5
6

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm sorry.

Who's issuing

the RFQ?

7
8

Basically we're

MS. SHEA:

The RFQ is going to be issued

by the Trust.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

10

mean the Trust or do you mean you?

11

MS. SHEA:

So when you say we, do you

I believe it would be the

12

Trust and I -- There will be questions that will it

13

be in conjunction with the City or not, but at this

14

point we believe it is the Trust.

15

City's advisors and your advisors and the City's

16

attorneys and your attorneys are working together

17

to put together this document, so I'm sorry if I

18

used we in the wrong way.

19
20
21

MR. HOFFMAN:
we.

No, you can absolutely use

I just wanted clarification.
MS. SHEA:

But we, the

Thank you.

What the RFQ would like to do

22

is describe the investment opportunity.

We have

23

two commissioners and Pat Taylor from CPS who are

24

going to come up and describe the process they have

 38
1

gone through to identify these retrofit projects,

2

the process they've gone through working to measure

3

and verify what we believe the savings are going to

4

be.

5

Also, we're going to get some

6

information on the background of the Trust

7

primarily from the Ordinance, how you were formed,

8

description of the projects as we've described.

9

A baseline term sheet, and by that

10

we mean we're going to in a very high level

11

determine what we believe the transaction will be.

12

We are going to ask for feedback on that because if

13

there are component parts of that term sheet that

14

are not workable with a majority of the investors,

15

we need to know that now.

16

the eleventh hour and have a problem.

17

We do not want to get to

The evaluation criteria, and the

18

City's advisors working with your advisors are

19

going to determine what those evaluation criteria

20

are going to be.

21

The submittal requirements, that's

22

what David basically suggested, both legal and

23

financial requirements and compliance requirements.

24

And lastly we're going to determine

 39
1

a high level time line with our hopes that should

2

the Trust determine to accept Retrofit 1 that we

3

could get this transaction completed, to fruition

4

by summer of 2013.

5

and I believe that your advisors believe that that

6

is a doable goal.

7
8

MR. HOFFMAN:

Courtney, would you pause

for a second?

9

MS. SHEA:

10
11

That is the goal of the City,

Sure.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think is this the first

time you appeared before us?

12

MS. SHEA:

Yes.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Would you say a little bit

14

for the Board about who you are?

15

think so -- We appreciate your being here.

16

think since this is the first time it would be

17

helpful for folks to know who you are in the

18

relationship.

19

MS. SHEA:

I know but I just
I just

My name is Courtney Shea.

20

I'm with the financial advisory firm of Kish

21

Financial Group which is a woman-owned financial

22

advisory firm.

23

years ago.

24

I opened the offices here three

We are a New Jersey-based company.
Prior to that I spent about 22 years

 40
1

as an investment banker at various firms here in

2

Chicago including being the head of LaSalle Bank's

3

national public finance practice, and by training I

4

have both a law degree and an MBA.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

That's helpful.

The firm

has been hired by the City --

7

MS. SHEA:

The City of Chicago -- The

8

CFO's Office, the Department of Finance to assist

9

with this particular transaction.

So we have been

10

working on this with the City since I believe about

11

the end of August.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

13

MS. SHEA:

Thank you.

Going back to the draft term

14

sheet provisions for consideration, as I said, it

15

is very high level what we're trying to determine

16

here.

17

of $50,000,000.

18

other infrastructure projects.

19

interest of many of these high-level infrastructure

20

investors, $50,000,000 is a minimum, and many of

21

them don't want to put in the work for a smaller

22

transaction.

23
24

For example, we have put a size of a minimum
I and my colleagues have done
In order to get the

The length of the agreement, the
maximum is 20 years.

We have -- As Commissioner

 41
1

Reynolds and Commissioner Powers and Pat Taylor

2

will tell you, we have projects that range in the

3

use of the life of 5 years like lighting to a

4

boiler which may have, you know, 40 or 50 year

5

average life, but we are saying it's going to be a

6

maximum of 20 years.

7

We are targeting a 20 percent annual

8

energy savings for these projects.

We are pledging

9

the sources of repayment to basically the energy

10

savings themselves and certain operations and

11

maintenance.

12

tell you that once he's had a conversion of his

13

plant he's going to need less employees to run the

14

operations, so that is an operational savings, and

15

that will be included within the 20 percent

16

savings.

17

For example, Commissioner Powers will

The facility ownership, all

18

facilities will continue to remain the owners --

19

owned by the City or in this case the Chicago

20

Public Schools.

21

be performed by the governmental unit as I

22

suggested.

23
24

The operation and maintenance will

The measurement and verification
will be provided by the governmental agency, and

 42
1

one of the things that we want to talk about is the

2

risk transfer which is we -- There are certain

3

things that obviously create risks in these

4

transactions.

5

investors if they're interested, one of the things

6

we're interested in is the risk transfer to our

7

financial partners rather than that risk being

8

maintained with the City.

As part of this sort of asking

9

And also what I previously suggested

10

which is that the City's MBE/WBE policies, lobbying

11

registration, all those things must be considered,

12

and we need to let people know that because the

13

private sector partners, sometimes they're not --

14

If they haven't done much governmental contracting

15

and such, they're not aware of this.

16

MS. FERGUSON:

17

Courtney, can I ask you a

quick question?

18

MS. SHEA:

19

MS. FERGUSON:

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

going to be perfect in this process.

22

should ask what they like, whatever comes to mind.

23

Let's do it.

24

Sure.

MS. FERGUSON:

Is it okay if I -Absolutely.

We are not

Everybody

At the highest level,

 43
1

just on this term sheet page that you have up on

2

the screen, before we get into the details from the

3

commissioners, I'd be interested in your

4

perspective as a financial advisor on how these

5

terms work together.

6

high level, my experience would suggest that the

7

pledge sources work in correlation with the risk

8

transfers?

9
10

MS. SHEA:

So, for example, just at a

Correct.

MS. FERGUSON:

And the suggestion that

11

the governmental agencies would retain ownership,

12

performance of the services and be responsible for

13

measurement, and yet you would expect to transfer

14

risk to the financial investor to me just needs a

15

little bit more clarification because I'm unclear

16

as to why a financial investor would be attracted

17

to that deal.

18

MS. SHEA:

This is why this transaction

19

is going to be ground breaking because this is not

20

what has been typically done in this field, and one

21

of the things that we're looking at is basically

22

the measurement and verification is being performed

23

by the City and their agencies, and part of our

24

process of asking our financial partners is do they

 44
1

want to come and do this in addition to the City.

2

Also with risk transfer one of the

3

things that we may have to look at is sort of a

4

lock box for these savings where in a particular

5

year they might be higher would it be required for

6

us to hold onto some of the extra savings --

7

MS. FERGUSON:

8

MS. SHEA:

9

MS. FERGUSON:

An escrow.

-- to create coverage.
Will the O and M savings

10

that you referenced -- Those would have to be

11

appropriated every year by each agency?

12

MS. SHEA:

Well, what we are

13

anticipating, again, this is very high level, is

14

that the appropriation that is currently being made

15

will be maintained through the course of the

16

transaction, and we are assuming that the cost will

17

be substantially less.

18
19
20

MS. FERGUSON:

Yes.

So each agency

would have to -MS. SHEA:

Budget at the continuing

21

appropriate level, and I'm assuming that that will

22

be a financial covenant --

23

MS. FERGUSON:

24

MS. SHEA:

Yes.

Okay.

Thank you.

-- a part of the transaction.

 45
1
2

MR. HOFFMAN:
this.

I have a question about

Courtney, on the pledge sources line --

3

MS. SHEA:

Yes.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- again, my understanding

5

of the process that we're engaging in is that you

6

and City officials and PFM and Kirkland are talking

7

about these exact issues on this line item to

8

figure out how that gets drafted in a document

9

that's going to be styled like an RFQ or something

10

like that that hopefully will be issued next month,

11

and then one purpose of the document is to see how

12

the marketplace reacts to that.

13

can't and you can't, for instance, decide

14

unilaterally that we know for sure these are going

15

to be the terms of an eventual RFP because we

16

anticipate this interim step, this preliminary step

17

to issue something like an RFQ and then get

18

reaction.

19

So we can't, we

Am I understanding correctly?
MS. SHEA:

Yes, you are understanding

20

that correctly, and to be very candid with you, we

21

have not, your advisors, the City's advisors, we

22

have not gone through the points of this term sheet

23

yet.

24

have not walked through it on a line-by-line basis

We are -- We have shared the document, but we

 46
1

at this point, but we are intending to do that in

2

the very near future.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

When you're saying a term

4

sheet, and I'm not trying to lock anyone into what

5

this document is called, but just to be clear,

6

we're talking about the same document that is going

7

to be issued in the future that David described as

8

an RFQ.

9

When you say term sheet, is that the same document?

10

I don't really care what it's called.

MS. SHEA:

Well, one of the issues that

11

we are, we believe will happen is that it will be

12

an appendices to the RFQ as a sample term sheet,

13

and we'd probably ask potential investors for their

14

feedback on it as far as if there's any terms that

15

are egregious that they couldn't live with or if

16

there's anything that potentially, you know, they

17

would require that's not part of the term sheet.

18

That's part of the evaluation process.

19

certain -- For example, when the City does the

20

swap, they cannot have one-day collateral.

21

just a non-starter, so there are certain things

22

that perhaps an investor is going to say I need

23

this and the City just can't succumb to it.

24

David's department says we can't give that up, so

There are

That's

 47
1

that investor may not end up being a qualified

2

investor because of what they can agree to or not

3

agree to.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

One follow-up on the line

5

of pledge sources.

6

that's a decision, meaning that could be what the

7

RFQ document says is that we are only, we only want

8

potential investors who are willing to engage in a

9

potential deal down the road that would be limited

10

to as you say energy savings, but that's a decision

11

to be made once that document goes out and we'll

12

see what the feedback is, but just so I understand

13

what that would mean, if that decision gets made

14

that's limited to energy savings and certain O and

15

M, just from a lay person's perspective, not

16

someone who is a finance person, does that mean

17

that if the City estimates that there will be

18

certain energy savings if certain building

19

renovations are done successfully, there will be

20

energy cost savings and certain O and M savings

21

that the return an investor can expect would be

22

calculated based on those savings?

23

that means?

24

So this says limited to.

MS. SHEA:

So

Is that what

That is correct.

 48
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

And then if those savings

2

don't materialize because the estimate was wrong,

3

that the investor -- In that scenario, the

4

investors would bear that risk because their return

5

wouldn't materialize in the same way as if the

6

energy savings were estimated properly?

7

MS. SHEA:

Correct.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.
Just one other question.

10

Was there any consideration for an off-ramp for

11

this provision, an off-ramp provision?

12

into the deal, a 20-year deal, 10 years in you

13

don't like it.

14

thought about having a provision to be shopped with

15

the market as to what would be acceptable in a case

16

like that?

17

Say you get

I mean is there a provision,

MS. SHEA:

We haven't considered that at

18

this point, Mr. Chairman, but it's something

19

obviously with your advisors --

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MS. SHEA:

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Think about it.

We will contemplate it.
I think that they wish

23

that that -- something was built in so that was in

24

there.

We might want to think about it.

It may be

 49
1

early on to do that but --

2

MS. SHEA:

Yes, sir, but we will

3

contemplate it as we go forward with the

4

transaction.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

On the same -- I mean it

7

will be very helpful I think from you and from PFM

8

as we go forward on this to hear about how this

9

compares with other similar transactions around the

10

country, around the world at least in this area of

11

retrofit.

12

And I hear your point that you

13

intend and the City intends this to be ground

14

breaking.

15

ground breaking, but all we can do is compare based

16

on experience, so I think to James' point, the

17

point about the length of the term of the agreement

18

and whether there's an out clause would be helpful

19

to hear how that comes out.

20

That would be great.

Nothing wrong with

Similarly, one thing that's come up

21

in prior deals is whether there should be revenue

22

sharing.

23

to think about revenue sharing here.

24

way to think about it is if the expected savings,

Now revenue -- I don't know exactly how
I think one

 50
1

both energy cost savings and O and M savings, are

2

expected to be X does that mean the investors get

3

all of X or it's split with the City?

4

any thought -- Has there been any thinking about --

5

Is that one of the decisions to be made as this RFQ

6

gets developed or is there any thought process on

7

that?

8

MS. SHEA:

Do you have

I believe it's one of the

9

decisions that the deal will contemplate, but, you

10

know, we, the Trust, the City still needs to find

11

out who is even interested in participating in

12

discussions before we start talking about revenue

13

sharing.

14

thought about.

15

who are interested to talk to us on the other side.

16

All this has been contemplated and
It's just we need to find people

May I go on with the time line?

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

18

MS. SHEA:

19

Yes, please.

Okay.

Great.

What we'd like to do and our goal is

20

to work with the Trust advisors and City advisors

21

to create a document which we will get to you for

22

your review with the hope of releasing the document

23

to the investor community in January should you

24

feel comfortable at your next meeting to give your

 51
1

advisors the opportunity to release that document

2

with hopes that we would get responses back in

3

February creating a pool into early March and then

4

moving the process along where those bidders will

5

discuss their thoughts with your advisors and the

6

City advisors and perform due diligence so that we

7

can come to fruition of getting the bid in and

8

then, you know, figuring out what is the most

9

economical way to proceed based upon the bids that

10

the Trust receives.

11

So our goals are to work with your

12

advisors in the very short term to get a document

13

to you, the Board, that you can review that your

14

advisors are comfortable with, the City's advisors

15

and the City is comfortable with to move the

16

process along.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Mr. Chairman, although I

18

was thinking that I would wait until the end to

19

sort of call other folks up who are our advisors --

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Do it now.

I do think that as part of

22

this, I think that with Courtney up here, if you

23

wouldn't mind, I might want to ask Tom to come up

24

and maybe, David, if you wouldn't mind coming up

 52
1

too.

I just have some questions about the last

2

point you were making, and I think it would be

3

helpful if I asked them now.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

Okay.

Thank you very much.

David, you introduced yourself.

7

Tom, would you introduce yourself again for the

8

record?

9

MR. MORSCH:

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

Tom Morsch with PFM.
So as everyone at this

11

table knows, PFM like Kirkland has been serving as

12

our pro bono independent financial advisor, and as

13

with Kirkland, I mean these folks have been

14

spending a lot of time on this without getting

15

paid.

16

time on this and helping advise us.

We really, really appreciate your spending

17

So one of the things that prompted

18

my asking you to come up is you have a line -- Let

19

me back up one step.

20

I have to say from my perspective I

21

really appreciate and I know all of us do that we

22

are moving.

23

want to move, and there were certain, you know,

24

there were obviously certain infrastructure and

I know the City wants to move.

We

 53
1

framework that we needed to set up, but I'm glad

2

that we're moving, and we certainly share the

3

desire to, if things can be moved forward in the

4

proper way, to do that, and I appreciate the fact

5

that there's a time line.

6

really good.

7

I think that's all

One question about -- Whatever this

8

document is going to be called, whether it's an RFQ

9

or something else, it seems like there's two -- And

10

I want to ask you, Tom, your view on this.

What

11

should we be thinking about the purpose of this

12

document?

13

twofold.

14

investors, to hear their feedback and to get their

15

potential qualifications that then presumably we,

16

meaning advised by you, PFM, will judge and that

17

would -- The end of that process would be the

18

creation of as it says here a pool or a list of

19

potential financial advisors and second to get

20

feedback, to get information from, you know,

21

either -- This is one of my questions -- either

22

those potential financial advisors or others to

23

learn how does the detail that we're laying out

24

here about how we envision this potential

Because it sounds like it's really
One is to hear from potential financial

 54
1

transaction, how does it strike you.

2

feasible?

3

seen around the country, around the world?

4

should we be thinking about this in light of your

5

experience?

6

Does it seem

Do you have other ideas of things you've

MR. MORSCH:

How

I think you've outlined it

7

very well, and I think David outlined that too is

8

the primary purpose of this document and this

9

exercise.

10

It's critical to get the input.

11

This is a partnership, right.

12

transaction, so the goal of these -- And what makes

13

these successful is engaging in that partnership

14

discussion, and I think the Trust provides a very

15

good, transparent way to do that, and I think

16

that's exactly what David outlined is the intention

17

here.

18

It's not a one-way

And so I think this is best

19

practice.

I think that it's the way to move

20

forward with this, and I think that the City is

21

being very thoughtful in terms of the innovation,

22

in terms of frankly stripping out the financing

23

because in some cases these deals historically --

24

And this is partly to your question, Diana.

Part

 55
1

of the, call it the profits or the other kinds of

2

benefits that accrue to the private party.

3

they're all bundled together, it's a little harder

4

to see what those are.

5

the City really is looking to move forward with

6

these projects which are proven in terms of

7

pay-back periods for making investments in capital

8

and then looking at purely from a financial

9

standpoint can we engage a private party to take on

When

What's happening here is

10

some of that financial risk, pay them a fair and

11

reasonable return, but we know exactly what that

12

is.

13

I think that's really the goal of

14

what David's outlined here and what Courtney has

15

begun to address.

16

that.

So we're at the beginning of

We're at the beginning of that process.

17

You know, we need to begin to tell

18

the investment community what it is we hope to

19

achieve and get their feedback on what, in fact,

20

they think about our hypothesis, and this is a

21

little more than a hypothesis I think as you'll

22

hear from the City departments.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:
questions.

Couple follow-up

One, so let's say that eight financial

 56
1

entities come forward with comments and their

2

qualifications and a ninth that turns out in the

3

future would be a great entity to do a potential

4

deal doesn't come forward because they look at this

5

document, RFQ or whatever it's called, and they say

6

we're just not convinced; we're not sure.

7

down the road after we've received feedback and so

8

on we issue an RFP.

9

about the details of an actual transaction, and

10

financial entity nine says, oh, we would like to

11

bid on that.

12

to hear from them as well.

13

this process should rule them out.

14

to clarify is it your view, Tom, that this RFQ,

15

while it's helpful to get qualifications and may

16

result in a list, it doesn't result in a closed

17

list that means that someone in the future can't

18

bid?

19

Then

Now we're asking for responses

I'm thinking to myself I would like

MR. MORSCH:

There's no reason that
I just wanted

I would say that's exactly

20

right, and that's the intention of the City.

An

21

RFP would be another -- It would be a formalized

22

bidding process, and it would be open to parties at

23

that point that are qualified.

24

to work through the details on how that occurs.

I think we'd have
I

 57
1

will defer to the procurement expert here David on

2

that topic.

3

MR. WINTERS:

Yeah, to give you another

4

example, at the MPEA and in particular for Navy

5

Pier -- This is no longer operative since Navy Pier

6

now operates as Navy Pier, but in the past when the

7

MPEA operated Navy Pier one of the things that we

8

would do would be to develop a pool of

9

concessionaires because people go in and out of

10

business, and it was not in anybody's interest as

11

far as the Pier was concerned to have dark space in

12

there ever, so we had a pool on hand so that if

13

somebody did go out of business we could go into

14

that pool and find a concessionaire that might be

15

able to take over the space and make it productive

16

and profitable.

17

entries into the pool so that when those future

18

opportunities came up people were available to us.

19

We never precluded anybody from just submitting

20

their qualifications.

21

At the same time we kept on taking

MS. SHEA:

The City's Department of

22

Finance -- And this is best practice, is to have

23

basically a rolling pool for the Department of

24

Finance, and that is what is intended here as well.

 58
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

Look, I know numerous

2

times when the City does this and issues an RFQ,

3

has the pool and then you have a master services

4

agreement, at times, that makes sense a lot of

5

times especially when you need services to be

6

continuous.

7

is another space.

8

continuous set of services.

9

stand on its own.

10

A concessionaire example is one.

IT

This is not where we need a
Each deal is going to

On the other hand -- So I don't

think those contexts necessarily apply.

11

On the other hand, it makes perfect

12

sense to get qualifications and have a pool.

13

just want to make sure it's not closed off because

14

I do think that one of the merits of this is --

15

When we issue the RFP, and we want innovation, I

16

want to hear from people even if it's the first

17

time that they've sent something in the RFP stage

18

that they've got an innovative way, and that's what

19

I'm hearing is that it won't be closed.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I

Let's just be clear that

21

if you don't respond to the RFP it does not

22

prohibit you from responding to the -- RFQ, it does

23

not prohibit you from responding to a subsequent

24

RFP.

 59
1

MS. SHEA:

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

Correct.
Let's just be clear.

Then that's it.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Second point on feedback.

5

So this is really a question.

I don't know exactly

6

how to think about this since I'm no expert in this

7

area.

8

Courtney, about the benefit of calling it something

9

that communicates seriousness.

And I heard you loud and clear, David and

I'm sure we're on

10

board with that.

11

That makes a lot of sense to me.

12

I'm certainly on board with that.

On the other hand, I also think that

13

this could be a very valuable document and process

14

to get feedback about, especially since, as you

15

say, we'd like to do something that may be a bit

16

challenging for folks to respond to or the intent

17

is that it be ground breaking.

18

I'd like to get feedback whether

19

people are thinking that I might be a financial

20

investor that would respond, that would bid on this

21

or not.

22

this.

23

construction industry or folks who have expertise

24

in putting renovations in buildings -- Since a key

As an example -- And I want your input on

It seems to me that whether it's the

 60
1

component in this is going to be are the savings

2

going to actually materialize as estimated.

3

where, it seems to be where the real risk factor

4

is.

5

not financial investors.

6

the ground, who know the details of the equipment,

7

have experience around the country and the world in

8

whether these things, whether the savings pan out.

9

I'd like to hear from them.

That's

Some of the people who are experts in that are
They're folks who are on

I think it would be

10

helpful to hear from them about whether in their

11

experience such and such would result in savings

12

materializing or not.

13

But they -- If this is limited to

14

only folks who might be bidders, it's not a vehicle

15

for them to provide information.

16

this document not only a traditional RFQ but also

17

something that gets feedback from the widest

18

possible sources?

19

downside in getting that feedback.

20

that?

Because I frankly see no

21

MS. SHEA:

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23
24

Can't we make

Any comments on

I have one.
Let me ask Tom first and

then I'll hear from everybody.
MR. MORSCH:

I think there's always

 61
1

value in whatever -- The more we can broadcast what

2

is being done in terms of the RFQ and that we're

3

open to feedback the better we are, and our

4

experience is that we'll get quite a few responses.

5

We may not get everybody, and we can't compel

6

people to respond.

7

The other part of it is I think that

8

you're also asking a due diligence question which

9

is that we really don't do all the due diligence we

10

should do, and I expect that the City is in the

11

process of looking at all, some of those topics

12

that you mentioned which is making sure they're

13

talking to experts in the field of installation,

14

experts in the field of equipment, experts in the

15

field of measurement, verification of these

16

savings.

17

that the City as an owner would conduct, and it's

18

also due diligence the potential investor will

19

conduct on their own.

20

That's part of the due diligence process

We can't expect all the due

21

diligence to be encompassed in one document.

22

Some of it is -- Some of it is at a level of detail

23

that I would not expect to be in the response.

24

MS. FERGUSON:

Okay.

I would think, David,

 62
1

just to chime in here, not to usurp your thunder,

2

but I think some of it would be proprietary to the

3

vendor of the equipment, right, and they would

4

probably be, they would probably partner -- Any

5

financial institution that is considering putting

6

up its capital into this type of transaction would

7

I assure you vet their diligence, the projections

8

that are associated with the savings and that are

9

associated with the type of construction or

10

installation that is being contemplated, and that

11

would be the diligence of the lender or the

12

investor and so I think we -- I'm not positive that

13

they would want that necessarily to be public or

14

would they consider that proprietary as part of

15

their own diligence process if we -- We're

16

expecting the risk transfer.

17

would want them to be the ones conducting the

18

diligence and be comfortable with that.

19

make sense?

I would think we

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

21

sure Courtney and David as well --

22

MS. SHEA:

It does.

Does that

I want to make

The only comment I was going

23

to make is the ordinance was very, very specific

24

right now that it is not designed by the finance

 63
1

which is where a number of those partners would

2

come in, and I don't disagree that those people

3

probably have a lot of relevant information, but we

4

are, at least for this particular transaction, we

5

are -- Statutorily ordinance-wise it's very clear

6

what we're supposed to do.

7

in those experts, they do it on their own dime or

8

they have to make them their partners, but it's not

9

like those firms are going to come in and say I

If they want to bring

10

might have an opportunity to do this because that

11

kind of as I call it holistic approach is not

12

available to a company that normally does that on

13

this particular transaction.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'll just say then, and

15

then we can move on, one of my reactions whenever

16

we are given a document to review and approve will

17

be that I just -- I still don't see the downside in

18

asking, and what I hear is we may not get anything

19

very meaningful for the reasons that have been laid

20

out, but my response to that would be, well, we

21

might.

22

request to the world to advise us as they see fit,

23

why not because you never know what you're going to

24

get when you ask for that kind of information, and

Unless there's a downside in making the

 64
1

I just want to make sure that we are as educated as

2

possible, and, therefore, I see no downside to

3

asking.

4

We can play this out I think as we

5

get the document, but I want to preview that that's

6

one of the questions I'll be asking if it doesn't

7

make that clear.

8

MS. SHEA:

Okay.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

David, did you have any --

10

MR. WINTERS:

No, only that Tom is

11

correct.

We have been speaking with experts in the

12

field throughout this process and have been doing

13

our due diligence, and some of that will become

14

obvious when the Commissioners speak.

15

MS. SHEA:

Obviously that's a sample

16

time line.

17

review the document thoroughly.

18

understand the components of it, and only at the

19

time that obviously you would be comfortable would

20

a vote take place.

21

at this point.

22

We understand that you'll want to
You'll want to

Obviously we can use a sample

MR. HOFFMAN:

Tom, while we have you up

23

here, do you want to comment a little bit about

24

the -- Stepping back, since we haven't heard -- I

 65
1

mean it seems to me that what we're doing is moving

2

forward in, for the first time in a very concrete

3

way on Retrofit Chicago as opposed to just hearing

4

briefings from the City about what they've been

5

doing.

6

this road.

Now it's clear that we're about to go down

7

I would say that having heard what

8

I've heard both from you in some discussions we've

9

had between meetings and from the City, I have a

10

comfort level that this is the right thing because

11

we're not committing ourselves to anything now

12

except let's just start walking down this road and

13

here's the topic.

14

One thing I think would be valuable

15

for the Board to hear and for the public to hear is

16

you as, you know, a non-City person, as our

17

independent advisor and from your experience, to

18

comment on some of the things you've heard from

19

David and Courtney about these kind of retrofit

20

projects.

21

around the country, around the world or is there a

22

long track record of public entities going out to

23

get private financing to help with environmentally

24

friendly retrofit projects and how should we be

Is this the first time this is happening

 66
1

thinking about that?

2

MR. MORSCH:

No.

There is certainly a

3

good track record to look at.

4

practices.

5

There's lots of best

I think where the City is really

6

kind of cutting the new ground here that's really

7

beneficial is being able to pool these various

8

assets from departments and create the kind of

9

scale and interest level at an investor and private

10

sector stage where we're going to, and as I

11

indicated a few moments ago, be able to look at the

12

component where it's not a bundled up mass of not

13

to say confusion but a bundled kind of proposal

14

where you don't, where the various benefits to the

15

private sector are somewhat hidden.

16

allows for more transparency to the transaction.

17

It allows for more scale, and it allows for City

18

agencies really I think to pool together their

19

assets that should drive down the capital costs,

20

should drive down the financing costs because if

21

you can create the pool and the scale, it should

22

make it better for each of them individually to be

23

part of that pool than to be able to have to go

24

through as David indicated each separate

I think this

 67
1

transaction to try and do and accomplish the same

2

thing.

3

So there's some innovation.

There's

4

some things that I think we all hope to achieve out

5

of the transaction and I think it's really -- It

6

could be very exciting if that could be done.

7

I think the market for these type of

8

transactions is beginning to mature to that point

9

where early on energy saving projects just because

10

they were new and innovative required, you know,

11

sophisticated technical people to be engaged to

12

them on a one-off basis.

13

We're now getting to a point where

14

there's a greater track record.

15

practices.

16

scale, and I think that's what the City's outlined

17

its intentions are.

18

really does fit nicely I think into what the Trust

19

goals are.

20

There's best

There's ways to drive economies of

So from that perspective it

I think the other thing that's

21

pretty attractive here is that you've got pay-back

22

period on some of this investment that are very

23

quick, so it's not something that you have to look

24

at 50 years from now and think about, well, let's

 68
1

hope and figure out what the outcome is going to

2

be.

3

things.

4

years, five years, the pay-back period.

5

new windows.

6

That's the whole idea of this.

7

that's attractive, and I think we can build on

8

that.

I think we're going to know many of these

9

Some are two years, three years, four
You put in

You know what you're going to get.

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's the part

That's helpful.

I just

10

want to say I take great comfort in not only

11

hearing from the City but hearing from our

12

independent advisors that this area of energy

13

saving private financing projects have a track

14

record, that what the City is talking about makes a

15

lot of sense from your perspective, that it's going

16

to depend on the details as we play them out but

17

that as an initial matter it makes a lot of sense.

18

Is this an ESCO?

How is this --

19

What are ESCOs?

20

the road from different from those in any way?

21

And how is what we're walking down

MR. MORSCH:

Again, I will defer

22

somewhat to David in kind of addressing this.

23

We're -- The goal here is to move beyond what an

24

ESCO was.

An ESCO was what I've more described

 69
1

before in terms.

2

works -- They're separate transactions of financing

3

and energy savings and guarantees.

4

we're trying to move off of that and create a new

5

model here.

6

outline.

7

It's a company that, you know,

And I think

I'll look to David here to kind of

MR. HOFFMAN:

Does that go to your point

8

that if we're -- By stripping out an isolated

9

financing piece of it there's some benefits to

10

that, and that's different than the way ESCOs

11

typically are set up?

12

MR. MORSCH:

And typically they were

13

simply transactions that frankly the government

14

entity was guaranteed.

15

do here is create a better risk sharing model so

16

that the private sector actually begins to bear

17

some risk for the transaction.

18

Okay.

What we're trying to

I think that that's something that

19

Lois Scott has indicated is critical and the Mayor

20

has indicated is critical -- is let's move some of

21

the risk sharing here so that this transaction does

22

not look like government is just taking all the

23

risk again.

24

I think from a public -- From the

 70
1

public standpoint, that's the part that we're

2

trying to be innovative, most innovative by which

3

is it's okay to return, to get a return on

4

investment but it's not okay to get a return on

5

investment without taking some risk.

6

think that's where the City is really moving

7

forward here.

8
9

You know, I

And, you know, the devil's in the
details, David, as you've indicated, and we're

10

getting there.

11

walking through this, and it will take some time,

12

but we're going to be back to you with the details

13

of this in a way that we think, you know, we'll all

14

be together nodding our heads saying we believe

15

we've accomplished this.

16

We're walking through documents and

MR. HOFFMAN:

Just so I understand, when

17

you say a typical ESCO means that the government is

18

guaranteeing, what I hear that to mean is that the

19

government is guaranteeing to the investors that

20

you will get either X savings or you will get X

21

return regardless of what we have on our end

22

regarding savings, and we're talking about changing

23

that risk calculus?

24

MR. MORSCH:

We are.

 71
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Just to comment, just to

2

address the broader issue, is this the right place,

3

the right state to be in.

4

the trends we're seeing in private industry where

5

the investment level for productivity improvements

6

have grown dramatically because of its body

7

function.

8

control it, and here even though we're not going

9

out getting private investment we are competing for

I think this parallels

You can reduce your costs.

You can

10

the small resources we have for investments, you

11

know, be it product development or things of that

12

nature.

13

And time and time again we're seeing

14

these projects getting a higher return, and that's

15

where the investment dollar is going, and so I

16

think you're in the right space.

17

of validates that we're going the right way.

18

just now how do we get it done in a way that makes

19

sense for both the investors and the City.

20

MR. MORSCH:

Right.

I think it sort
It's

Just very quick on

21

the economics, David, to just illustrate this.

22

Let's say we invest $10 and we return $2 in savings

23

on our energy bill.

24

about there, that's a 20 percent IRR.

The 20 percent we're talking
Okay.

 72
1

That's substantial.

2

find an investment at that level?

3

trying to do is we're trying to trim that down.

4

We're trying to make it a reasonable return on

5

investment.

6

what it should share for the risks that it bears

7

and have the private industry share what it should

8

share based on the risk that it bears, so just at a

9

high level, and so that's what we're trying to

10

Can you go -- Can any of us go
So what we're

We're trying to have government share

achieve.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

In terms of the process of

12

what will happen regarding the creation of the

13

pool, was it contemplated, Tom, that PFM would be

14

judging the qualifications and then make

15

recommendations to the Board about who meets the

16

qualifications and is in the pool, PFM with the

17

City?

18

process should be on that?

What's your view, Tom, about what the

19

MR. MORSCH:

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

With the City.
So one outcome of this

21

document would be that we would get a

22

recommendation from you but here are the entities

23

that meet the qualifications?

24

MR. MORSCH:

Yeah.

 73
1
2

MR. HOFFMAN:

Some joint

recommendations.

3

MS. SHEA:

4

MR. MORSCH:

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

8
9
10

It's a collaborative effort.
Yes.
Thank you.
Anything else, David?

There may be but I am --

And to me this is the core.
CHAIRMAN BELL:
MR. HOFFMAN:

Absolutely.

I think that while not to

11

diminish, of course, the what are going to be more

12

detailed operational presentations from the

13

Departments which are also important, but to me in

14

terms of at least my and I think our getting an

15

understanding about what the process looks like, I

16

think this makes a lot of sense.

17

So in the interest of time, why

18

don't we move ahead and then if I have a question I

19

can ask then.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah.

Listen, I think

21

that any question you have as this thing proceeds,

22

let's just ask it because we need to walk away from

23

here comfortable where we're headed here.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

So since you -- With the

 74
1

benefit of an additional 15 seconds, let me ask at

2

least one more.

3

David, one of the things you

4

mentioned -- I'm going to ask you about the single

5

purpose entity you mentioned.

6

discussion to be had later, that's fine because I

7

don't think that there's any decision making that's

8

going to need to happen on our side even next time

9

before the RFQ gets issued.

If this is a

But you did mention

10

it, so I want to both ask Tom about any comments

11

and make sure I understood because I didn't really

12

understand where you were going with this.

13

What I heard you say, and you were

14

talking about the benefits of doing this in part

15

through the Trust, was that a single purpose entity

16

would be formed, I think I heard you say by the

17

Trust?

18

MR. MORSCH:

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

Um-hum.
And that one of the

20

benefits of that would be it would be transparent

21

and simple because it would be one place where

22

money was going in and going out.

23

little bit more about that to the extent there is

24

more to be said?

Can you say a

And then, Tom, if you do have any

 75
1

comment about that, I just want to know is that

2

something that is so standard we should feel

3

comfortable with it?

4

feel comfortable with it in this way or as to be

5

played out?

6

Is it new but we should still

Those are some of my questions.

MR. WINTERS:

I really think it is as

7

simple as I described it to you as you just related

8

it.

9

at this point.

10

I don't have much to add to that description

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, it's a common

11

practice in airplane financing where you sell a

12

bunch of airplanes.

13

Those assets go into it.

14

They have equity plays or whatever they want to do

15

but that's it.

16

all that's on the table.

17

either deliver the value that you said or the

18

investors lose, but the people that have put it

19

together, they're out of it unless, of course, you

20

have to put some equity in and there's some sort

21

of -- Usually you have to put some small piece in,

22

but that's pretty commonplace.

23
24

You form a separate entity.
The investors invest.

It makes it very clean, that that's

MR. HOFFMAN:

You know, these assets

Would that be a single

purpose entity, therefore, that would be basically

 76
1

formed by the Trust and, therefore, what, a

2

subsidiary of the Trust?

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It would be formed by

4

the Trust.

5

It would be a legal entity.

6

It would probably not be a subsidiary.

MS. SHEA:

It's none.

The interesting

7

part -- This was used commonly in tobacco, when the

8

tobacco settlement came down since many of the

9

states did tobacco financing.

Some did a single

10

purpose entity where their tobacco proceeds came in

11

and paid off the plaintiffs.

12

In this case what's interesting

13

about it and kind of unique is let's assume that

14

this contemplated transaction did include the three

15

departments, two departments and CPS that you'll

16

hear from.

17

two City departments and a sister agency, it would

18

be -- This would be the best way to do it because,

19

otherwise, it would have to be two lock boxes or

20

three lock boxes.

21

simplify the process.

Because the money would be coming from

This is a way that would

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

MR. MORSCH:

24

Tom, any comments?
No, I concur.

I mean it's

a very common vehicle for doing these type of

 77
1

transactions.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

So, therefore, it would

3

be -- It would not be a City entity.

4

private not-for-profit entity in the same way that

5

we are?

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

8
9
10

It would be a

Yes.

Is that what would be

contemplated?
CHAIRMAN BELL:
MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

Let me just turn to Henry

11

and Scott at Kirkland.

12

answer any questions about this since we're just

13

talking about it at a very, very high level.

14

any comments from you guys in your experience about

15

how we should be thinking about this?

16
17

MR. FALK:

It may be premature to

But

This is Scott Falk.

I agree with all the speakers that a

18

separate limited liability company be called a

19

special purpose entity, but it would be liability

20

remote so that any losses in the entity wouldn't

21

be, wouldn't create exposure for any other

22

investment that's being funded through any

23

investment pool.

24

per transaction, one per tranche, per transaction,

But as for whether we have one

 78
1

it's to be determined based on investor demand and

2

complexity of the project.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you.

David, I should tell you

5

it's easier to describe this than it is to do.

6

mean because there's precedence as in airplane

7

financing.

8

is the right way to go if we can make it happen.

9

Put it that way.

This is uncharted territory, but this

I think this is the way you best

10

protect the City and you best protect on a

11

project-by-project basis.

12

MR. FALK:

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

14

And they are very common.
They are common in other

areas.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

Okay.

Thank you.

Okay.

Let's proceed

with the presentations.

18

Good morning.

19

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Good morning.

20

My name is David Reynolds.

21

for the City's Department of Fleet and Facility

22

Management.

23
24

I

I'm the Commissioner

It's a pleasure to be before you
today and talk about some very exciting projects

 79
1

we're thinking about.

2
3

If I get too animated, it's because
I love energy efficiency, and so just talk me down.

4

A little bit about my background.

5

I'm an engineer by training.

I spent five years

6

working in the corporate world doing construction

7

management for a major pharmaceutical company.

8

I've worked for three different engineering

9

consultants, one architecture firm.

Spent eight

10

years at the City of Chicago in the Department of

11

Environment.

12

Illinois Facilities Fund that does development for

13

other non-profits and back to the City since May,

14

so I've had experiences in the private sector both

15

corporate, consultant, non-profit and then back to

16

the City.

17
18
19

Worked for a non-profit called the

MR. HOFFMAN:

What were you doing for

the Department of Environment?
COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

At the

20

Department of Environment -- I was there eight

21

years, and I did a little bit of everything.

22

I left, I was the First Deputy Commissioner.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

When

Welcome back to the City.
Thank you.

It's

 80
1
2

good to be back.
A little bit of history about Fleet

3

and Facility Management.

4

City in the past, it may be a new name to you.

5

reason is that we're a merger of two different

6

departments -- the Department of Fleet Management

7

and the Department of General Services.

8

If you were around the
The

One of the things that Mayor Emanuel

9

asked us to do when he took office was to look for

10

opportunities to improve services at a better price

11

for the citizens by consolidation.

12

the departments formed by consolidation.

13

We were one of

We are responsible for 425

14

facilities, so the ones that we are responsible for

15

include libraries, police stations, fire stations,

16

not schools, not the airports, not CHA, not parks.

17

Really the core public service buildings.

18

We're also responsible for all the

19

equipment that is either owned or leased by the

20

City of Chicago ranging from garbage trucks to

21

street sweepers to police vehicles to fire engines.

22

In addition to our responsibility

23

for the care and management of these facilities and

24

equipment, we also buy utilities for all City

 81
1

operations.

Our annual utility budget is about

2

$100,000,000.

3

operations including those used by Water Management

4

and by the Department of Aviation.

5
6

We buy utilities for all of our City

We have about 1,000 employees, and
our annual budget is about 330,000,000.

7

A little bit about our goals and

8

objectives for Retrofit Chicago.

The first one

9

coming out of the box is we're going to reduce

10

energy consumption and look for ways of modernizing

11

our facilities in an economically feasible manner.

12

A lot of the funding that has

13

traditionally been available for energy efficiency

14

whether it's grants, other types of fundings, it

15

often is available for the quick hit project,

16

things like lighting retrofits which tend to be a

17

quick payback.

18

this particular opportunity is that it will allow

19

us to invest in some of our infrastructure that

20

isn't necessarily well suited for those quick hit

21

sources of financing.

22

boilers that have a much longer life.

23

Their incremental improvement over older boilers,

24

it's good but not necessarily enough for a quick

What excites me and my staff about

Examples are things like
They also --

 82
1

payback, so through Retrofit Chicago we believe

2

that we're going to be able to have a nice balance

3

of some remaining quick payback projects as well as

4

deeper projects like boiler retrofits.

5

We want to improve the comfort level

6

and functionality of our buildings.

7

facilities are either used by City employees or

8

used by the public.

9

whether it's our employees or the public they're in

10

a facility that's the right temperature, that it's

11

good to be there, so that's important to us as

12

well.

13

All of our

We want to make sure that

We're looking for long-term savings

14

but also long-term savings that could be measured

and verified.

really good investment for us, for the City, for

17

the Trust, so that the savings aren't something

18

that we do on the back of a napkin and then worry

19

about it later; that we actually want some rigor to

20

how we determine those savings as well as how we

21

measure and verify them in the future.

22

We want to make sure that this is a

We see this as a potential for job

23

creation.

We will incorporate MBE and WBE

24

requirements, and it is supportive of Mayor

 83
1

Emanuel's Sustainable Chicago 2015 plan which noted

2

that -- A goal of improving energy efficiency in

3

municipal buildings by ten percent by 2015.

4

So our process.

We started this

5

late in 2011.

McKen (phonetic) has been providing

6

pro bono services, so Fleet and Facility Management

7

are two of them and the Mayor's Office.

8

what we were calling a sizing exercise where the

9

question was if you were to have a private source

We did

10

of funds to invest in energy efficiency how big

11

would that project be.

12

sources.

13

audits, that had been completed for our facilities

14

by Commonwealth Edison's engineers, so for our

15

larger facilities we had recent audits that

16

indicated project size as well as potential

17

savings.

18

We looked at a variety of

We had a number, actually over 100

We also looked at our other

19

buildings that hadn't been audited, and based on

20

their age, their building type, their use, we

21

estimate very conservative potential projects and

22

energy savings from those facilities.

23
24

That's where we got to a $40,000,000
target, so it's a combination of audits that have

 84
1

been done in the past, some projections based on

2

what we expect we can achieve in other buildings.

3

Again, this was a target.

4

As far as managing the project, we

5

have retained the Public Building Commission.

6

sure many of you are familiar with them.

7

stand-alone unit of government and they -- Their

8

purpose is to provide planning design, construction

The Public Building Commission

16

assisted us with a very rigorous procurement

17

process to select ESCOs, the energy service

18

companies that we talked about earlier.

19

that process working with the PBC we identified

20

three different ESCOs to proceed with the audits

and assessments of our facilities.

MR. HOFFMAN:

4

issue an RFP for that?

5

process?

6

It's

David, did you or PBC
Was that the competitive

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Yes.

It was

7

actually a request for qualifications because we

8

have to do the audits to know what the project is

9

going to look like, and so it was a request for

10

qualifications to identify firms that were capable

11

of handling this volume and had a good demonstrated

12

track record of actually delivering on energy

13

savings.

14
15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Have contracts been

entered into with each of those three companies?

16

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Yes, for the

17

investment grade audit set which is the first step.

18

Once financing is in place we'll move to the design

19

and implementation step.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Could you e-mail me and

21

any of the Board members that want the RFP?

22

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

otherwise.

Yes.

Maybe through Scott or

I'd be interested in reading it.

 86
1

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

3
4

Sure.

Thank you.

Continue.
COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

With the three

5

ESCOs, they certify evaluating 232 facilities, so

6

we provided them preliminary, a bunch of

7

information actually on design of those facilities,

8

operating histories, utility bills.

9

Using their expertise they narrowed

10

that down to a list of about 104 buildings that the

11

ESCOs thought were prime candidates for investment

12

grade audits.

13

familiar to the folks who finance projects like

14

this, but it is an engineering way of assessing

15

opportunities, calculating savings, demonstrating

16

how those savings can be measured over time that

17

can be used for making financial decisions, so it's

18

a very rigorous type of audit.

19

Investment grade audits are very

Some of our baseline requirements

20

for the program.

We wanted the budget to be

21

all-inclusive.

22

capital being used to support the project, so the

23

$40,000,000 as a target needs to include design,

24

construction, financing costs.

We don't anticipate any other

It needs to include

 87
1

the management costs from the Public Building

2

Commission.

3

It all needs to be in there.
As we've determined or as we work on

4

the payback and savings calculation, all of those

5

assumptions or baseline requirements are built into

6

those calculations.

7

For now we're focusing only on

8

energy cost reductions for our savings.

Part of

9

that is that the way they operate our buildings, we

10

have engineers and tradesmen who all work in

11

multiple buildings, and so it's not necessarily

12

going to result in a reduction of personnel.

13

will we believe obviously result in a great

14

reduction in energy.

15

It

There are rebates and incentives

16

that are available either through the Department of

17

Commerce and Economic Opportunity or other private

18

foundations.

19

approaching those incentives is that they are

20

bonuses, meaning if you get them, we can use them

21

to help pay down the finance.

22

The way that we're currently

What we're not going to do is to

23

take a $40,000,000 project and give $4,000,000 in

24

incentives, make it a $44,000,000 project.

We're

 88
1

going to go the other direction.

2

We're requiring annual cash flows.

3

The funding that we're going to commit to pay back

4

this financing is the funding that is in our budget

5

now to pay for utilities, and so it's important to

6

us to have positive cash flows across the life of

7

the projects.

8
9

And then as has been discussed
before, verifying and guaranteeing savings is very

10

important.

11

three years.

12

projects, the ESCOs will guarantee performance for

13

the life of the payback period, and so if it's a

14

15-year payback, for example, the ESCO will sign on

15

the dotted line.

16

improvements don't deliver those savings across the

17

15-year period, they will write a check to make up

18

the difference, so it's in their best interest to

19

make sure the savings are delivered.

20

money to get a guarantee like that.

21

I'm going to touch on this idea of
A lot of the traditional ESCO

If the energy efficiency

That costs

Our approach is to go for a

22

three-year guarantee from the ESCOs rather than

23

guarantee for the entire life.

24

if these energy efficiency improvements aren't

The reason is that

 89
1

performing after three years there's issues, and

2

we're going to be talking to the ESCOs about how

3

they make good on the warranty claims.

4

We feel like three years is a good

5

period of time for the bugs to be worked out, to be

6

in really standard operation and not necessarily

7

need to continue paying for a guarantee from the

8

ESCO.

9

However, a couple points that we're

10

going to use to bolster this, make sure that we're

11

making a good decision here -- it's really the

12

second and third points on the slide -- is that

13

we're going to have measurement verification plans

14

in place.

15

their investment during audits.

16

have a third party evaluate those to make sure that

17

they're appropriate and consistent for the types of

18

recommendations that are going to be implemented.

19

The ESCOs will provide those as part of
We're going to

We're also going to implement a

20

computerized maintenance management system as part

21

of this.

22

we use to manage our buildings.

23

looking for this project to help upgrade it.

24

idea being that before the ESCOs leave they will

We already have a work order system that
However, we're
The

 90
1

have put together for us a maintenance system that

2

tells us exactly here are the steps that need to be

3

implemented to maintain this equipment over time.

4

So we have schedules for replacing filters.

5

have schedules for replacing belts, everything that

6

we would need as a maintenance and operation

7

department to make sure that we know exactly what

8

we should be doing over time to maintain those

9

facilities so that they really continue to optimize

10

We

that energy savings.

11

ALDERMAN POPE:

Can I ask you a

12

question?

Talking about budget and measuring

13

savings.

I think Diana suggested earlier that

14

monies be set aside in the annual budget to pay for

15

those or the cost savings -- Will money be set

16

aside in the budget annually to pay down the debt

17

on these?

18

done to date?

19

percent in the year 2014 on the project and you've

20

got a debt of a million dollars, is that going to

21

be allocated specifically in your budget for

22

project X to pay down that debt?

23
24

Any ideas based on what you've already
If you are realizing savings of 20

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Yes.

Our

budget, our annual budget will continue to show --

 91
1

I mentioned before we're going to -- The money that

2

we're currently budgeting to pay for utilities is

3

now going to be -- Part of that will be set aside

4

to pay back this debt, so for the life of the

5

financing, the life of the payback period, we'll

6

continue to have a -- Well, we will have a line

7

item in our budget that is to repay this financing.

8
9

That's a very important point for a
couple of reasons.

As you mentioned, making sure

10

that we have a commitment to pay it back.

11

second one is that that means that we're not going

12

to -- As a city, we won't see the savings hit our

13

bottom line until the financing is paid off, so

14

it's in our best interest to pay off the financing

15

as soon as possible so then the savings that we had

16

set aside from the energy efficiency improvements,

17

that actually becomes bottom line savings for the

18

City.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

The

Unless, as we discussed

20

earlier, the revenue sharing concept is applied

21

here so that if, for instance, if a deal is struck

22

so that the City is sharing the savings with the

23

investor, then actually you would be seeing some of

24

the bottom line savings earlier.

 92
1

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Right.

2

on how the financing is structured.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Depends

One follow-up question on

4

John and Diana's point about budget.

For the 2013

5

budget for your department, are there any

6

assumptions made about the possibility of there

7

being this kind of private financing?

8

of your budget -- Is that part of your budget that

9

has been passed?

Is that part

10

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

11

was passed -- The quick answer is no, not yet

12

because the implementation for this will happen

13

later in 2013 and early 2014, so the savings, we're

14

really not going to start racking those up until

15

after the first of the year.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me ask it a different

17

way.

18

no deal is struck.

19

effect on your budget for 2013?

20

Our budget that

Let's say that to everyone's disappointment
Does that have any tangible

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

For 2013, no,

21

because we have set up our budget for utilities as

22

if these changes won't be made.

23

effect it would have on us is that many of these

24

changes won't be made.

The long-term

 93
1
2

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

I mean you're doing

budget planning for 2014 and afterwards.

3

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Correct.

But no one in the City

5

including the City Council -- Of course, there has

6

been no action taken as to what the 2014 budget

7

will be?

8

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

10

Correct.

Yes.

It's just a planning

exercise?

11

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.

Well, it's got to be a

13

little more than that.

14

have to pay the difference of your actual cost and

15

the budget you put in place to this entity that

16

holds the debt.

17
18

I mean ultimately you'd

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Correct, but

that --

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

If there's financing.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, if there's

21

financing.

You have a deal.

I mean they still

22

would have to keep a certain level in the budget

23

that's higher than their actual experience because

24

they're going to have to pay the difference between

 94
1

that and that budget into the entity to service the

2

debt.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

4

asking for 2013.

5

right?

Yeah.

I guess I was

You do not have that line item;

6

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

8
9

For 2013 --

You do not have that

financing item?
COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Correct, we

10

don't because, again, by the time the financing is

11

in place, the implementation, it's a little bit

12

down the road.

13
14

MR. HOFFMAN:

And the flip side, if a

deal was entered in too quickly?

15

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

And you would be basically

17

looking at the line item related to utility

18

payments to sort of figure out is that going to be

19

decreased if for some -- Although this is unlikely

20

you're going to see savings in 2013?

21

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Correct.

If we

22

came out of the box and did all of our projects in

23

a month and we had savings right away, then the

24

portion of our utility budget that we currently

 95
1

have set aside to pay for natural gas and

2

electricity would pay for the financing.

3
4

MR. HOFFMAN:

I have a question on this

bullet point, the bottom one.

5

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

So it seems -- Obviously

7

one of the things that's going to be very important

8

for us to discuss, get a handle on and try to

9

manage on is risk.

Although, you know, this will

10

be flushed out in the coming months about how we

11

should be analyzing and thinking about risk.

12

Clearly one of the top line issues is going to be

13

the risk that the savings will materialize.

14

bullet point is in part about that.

15

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

This

Yes.

You were talking about

17

ESCOs guaranteeing the savings, and you talked

18

about the length of years and so on.

19

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

This is very preliminary,

21

so I don't want to lock you into anything but just

22

in the interest of trying to understand this.

23

if the ESCOs are guaranteed for three years,

24

they're only guaranteed for three years, does that

Even

 96
1

mean that there's risk after the three years to the

2

City and to the Trust if the savings are less than

3

anticipated after that?

4

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

At the three

5

year -- We -- Our feeling, our understanding is

6

that -- Let me back up just a little bit.

7

When one of these conservation

8

measures is implemented, there will be first a

9

warranty period.

During that warranty period is

10

when we will work with the Public Building

11

Commission and the ESCOs to make sure the equipment

12

is performing as it was designed.

13

get into the guarantee period, so we've already

14

determined that it's been sized properly, installed

15

properly, set up properly.

16

properly.

17

After that we

It's operating

During those first three years of

18

its operation, any bugs that are left will be

19

worked out because the ESCOs will have to be

20

writing checks every year if we don't achieve our

21

savings for those first three years, so it's in

22

their best interest to help us make sure the

23

equipment is all operating perfectly and as

24

designed during those three years.

 97
1

At that point in time is when we

2

will move into managing.

3

We will have been managing the equipment already,

4

but we no longer have the backstop of the

5

guarantee.

6

The guarantee goes away.

Now, to directly answer your

7

question, this is greater risk than a traditional

8

ESCO deal because the traditional ESCO, the

9

guarantee would be for the entire pay-back period.

10

That costs money -- a couple percentage points, and

11

so our feeling in getting this is -- Everything

12

will be --

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

David, I think we can be

14

clear in answering David's question.

15

no.

16

this financing, the risk is going to go into this

17

private entity.

18

is pricing -- is what is it going to cost us to get

19

the investor to accept this risk if we only have a

20

three-year guarantee.

The answer is

There will be no risk -- If we're going to get

21

The issue is -- what you're buying

But to answer your question, if we

22

structure a deal, the City is not going to incur --

23

have any risk.

24

City, no go back to the Trust.

There will be no go back to the
It's going to all

 98
1

reside in that entity, but it is going to have an

2

impact on pricing because if they, if the investor

3

perceives that the risk is higher because they only

4

got a guarantee for three years, they're going to

5

want a greater return.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Doesn't it depend on how

7

it's structured because the payments that flow, the

8

money that flows into the single purpose entity are

9

going to flow to the investors.

That money is

10

going to come from the City pursuant to these

11

savings; right?

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

13

make them, then the investor eats it.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16
17
18
19
20
21

Exactly.

If the deal is structured?
That's the only way

we're going to structure it.
MR. HOFFMAN:

If we don't

That's the only --

And this is -- This may be

just my moving along and understanding.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

It's good because we

need to air this out.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me ask what I think

22

you mean by that.

So that means that if -- Under

23

that scenario the deal would provide that if -- The

24

City would put X amount of money into the single

 99
1

purpose entity that come from savings, but if the

2

energy savings are half of that, then the City is

3

only putting half of that, and the investor knows

4

that upfront and, therefore, will bear that risk.

5

That's the way that deal will be structured?

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

8

We'll, of course, see how,

we'll see what we get back from folks but that --

9
10

Exactly.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's the way it works.

That's the model.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

All right.

And is that

12

your -- I mean you're not the finance guy.

13

the building and energy efficiency environmental

14

person but does that -- Do you see any -- Does that

15

create any questions or concerns for you or do you

16

agree with James?

17
18
19
20

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

I agree with

James.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

The question is going to

be the market is going to question it.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

You're

front of us now.

Right.
The market --

We don't have them in

We have the City.

 100
1

Now let me focus on the first three

2

years.

3

in our lives and so on.

4

upfront, but then sometimes the company that

5

provides the warranty says, well, you're at fault.

6

So warranties, we all deal with warranties
It sounds very clear

And I noticed you mentioned the PBC,

7

the City entity, is going to be in charge of

8

construction and design of the building.

9

One of the things I want to be worrying about is

And I --

10

worst case scenarios.

11

that scenario, when we hear someone say guarantee,

12

three-year warranty, no problem, do we need to

13

worry that the company who is providing the

14

warranty or the guarantee would say it's not our

15

fault?

16

but a City person, someone from the PBC installed

17

it incorrectly or designed it incorrectly, so the

18

warranty does not apply and, therefore, even in

19

that three-year period there is risk.

20

correct or am I thinking about it the wrong way?

21

That's one of our jobs.

In

The equipment we bought worked pretty well

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Is that

That's not

22

exactly correct.

The reason is that as the ESCO

23

has taken full responsibility from audit through

24

installation and start-up, so if it was designed

 101
1

incorrectly, the ESCO designed it incorrectly, and

2

it's their responsibility.

3

incorrectly, the ESCO installed it incorrectly, and

4

it's their responsibility.

If it was installed

5

So during that whole interim from

6

audit through the end of the guarantee, the ESCO

7

pretty much has full responsibility for the design,

8

construction, operation of that.

9

being that our City personnel will still manage the

10

buildings, and so routine changing filters, things

11

like that, we'll continue to do.

12

something that we're interested in seeing how the

13

market reacts to that because their -- Another

14

service ESCOs provide is that they can provide

15

those services through the term of the guarantee.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

The exception

That's also

Last question.

When you

17

look around the country or the world, do you say

18

that's the place we want to model after because

19

they've done it just like this or do you feel like

20

we're so new on what you're doing on this that

21

there's really no good model?

22

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

ESCOs are not a

23

new idea.

They've been around for a while.

They

24

got a bad wrap probably in the '80s and '90s as a

 102
1

little bit of snake oil but I think that has

2

really -- The industry has really straightened up,

3

and it's a very respectable industry.

4

What other cities aren't doing is

5

bringing the private financing to this.

So ESCOs,

6

it's been done.

7

idea of bringing the financing as opposed to

8

self-financing or asking the ESCO to finance it is

9

what's new.

People do it all the time.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

11

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

The

Thank you.
Our findings so

12

far in the work that's been done because we've

13

already started the site visits, the audits, the

14

announcements, the data, the types of energy

15

conservation measure that we will most likely see

16

in our facilities include building automation

17

systems, so these are the types of systems that

18

turn the boiler on and off.

19

temperature in a room, everything that makes the

20

system operate as automatically and smoothly as

21

possible.

22

They manage

We're going to see some lighting

23

replicas.

We've done a lot of lighting replicas.

24

However, there's still opportunity for improvement

 103
1

and also for adding controls, whether they're

2

dimmers, motion sensors, timers to make sure if

3

there's no one in the room the lights aren't on.

4

We're going to see some repair and

5

replacement to our heating and ventilation systems,

6

this could be fans and boilers, chillers, as well

7

as improvements to the building envelope, things

8

like tightening up windows, perhaps working on the

9

roof, doing things to make the exterior shell of

10

the building more energy efficient.

11

So at a high level this is our

12

preliminary findings.

13

for a few months.

14

site visits.

15

refine over time.

16

The ESCOs have been working

They've done quite a number of

These numbers are continuing to

One thing I want to start by

17

explaining is how we distributed the facilities

18

among the different ESCOs because you'll see

19

there's the police service, public safety

20

headquarters and similar restrictions.

21

We started by giving each of the

22

three ESCOs a core building type, so one of them

23

got police, one got fire, one got wireless.

24

a lot of those facilities had been built around the

Those,

 104
1

same time.

2

sense for us for one ESCO to get really good at

3

police stations, one to get really good at

4

wireless, so that -- In our facility types that's

5

the first group.

6

They're operated similarly, so it made

The second group are more one-off

7

facilities, not specifically one-off, the more

8

unique facilities like a maintenance garage.

9

got 14 maintenance garages.

10
11

We've

None of them are

really the same.
The third facility -- Each category

12

is a show case building or another way of looking

13

at it is that is a very large building where there

14

can be lots of impact.

15

headquarters, City Hall and the Cultural Center.

16

Those are public safety

Each of the three ESCOs got a group

17

of facilities assigned to them.

18

that group is some core of similar type buildings

19

followed by some additional buildings that we know

20

we need to do followed by the large buildings.

21

The first part of

Based on the work the ESCOs have

22

done so far we believe about 104 of the facilities

23

will result in investment grade audits which means

24

that the ESCO has identified and we've agreed that

 105
1

there's significant opportunity there that's worth

2

doing the investment grade audit and including it

3

in its portfolio.

4

You'll see a list of the different

5

types of projects that we intend to do in the

6

buildings, we anticipated doing, the cost of those

7

projects, our annual savings based on year one

8

projections and then finally a simple pay-back

9

period.

10

Again, this is preliminary.

We're

11

not done yet, but it's shaping up to be -- Rather

12

than a $40,000,000 target, it's more like a

13

$37,000,000 target with a pay-back period of about

14

11 years, so estimated savings of 3.3 million a

15

year.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Can you say something

17

briefly on the last column and explain how you

18

calculated this simple pay-back period?

19
20

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Sure.

The ESCOs as part of their work so

21

far have used their experience to estimate the

22

costs of the projects, and so it's the designs, the

23

buying materials, doing the implementation.

24

the all-inclusive costs.

That's

So the third column --

 106
1

Actually, the fourth column is that cost.

2

The second thing is from their

3

experience they have estimated what those savings

4

would be from the retrofits.

5

straightforward.

6

smaller bulb in it.

7

with estimated savings.

8

might be more complicated.

9

For lighting it's

You take a big bulb and put a
Do the math, and you come up
For things like boilers it

The third column is putting the

10

total cost in the numerator, so 19.7 million, the

11

same thing in the denominator -- 1.6 in the bottom

12

and divide it.

15

back the cost of the project.

So it's saying we have a 19.7
We're saving 1.6 million a

It will take 12.2 years of savings to pay

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

17

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Next steps for

18

us -- The investment grade audits will be complete.

19

I'm sorry.

20

will be confirmed.

21

bit, and we will have approved all the energy

22

conservation measures, so we'll have said building

23

by building this is the type of improvement we want

24

you to do in each building based on your

The facility list -- 104 facilities
That still is in limbo a little

 107
1

recommendations.

2

By the middle of January we're going

3

to be complete with all the facility inspections

4

and the contractor walk-throughs.

5

walk-throughs, what happens in that step is that

6

the ESCOs bring in the companies that will actually

7

do the work and get hard bids for the work, so the

8

numbers become more and more and more secured, more

9

precise.

10

The contractor

At the end of February we're going

11

to have the investment grade audits done.

12

Depending on financing, in mid 2013 we anticipate

13

moving into design and implementation and then

14

sometime in 2014 be substantially complete with all

15

these improvements.

16
17
18

Any additional questions?
ALDERMAN POPE:

Dave, I have a couple.

The assets that were not chosen that

19

were eliminated from this list, can you provide to

20

us when appropriate what the reasons were that they

21

were not included --

22

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

23

ALDERMAN POPE:

24

Yes.

-- strictly a cost

savings perspective or some other issues?

 108
1

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

We will provide

2

that.

That's actually one of the things that we

3

have tasked the ESCO to do which is to tell us why

4

you thought this building wasn't worthy of putting

5

in the program.

6

ALDERMAN POPE:

My concern with that,

7

and I've expressed that before, especially as it

8

comes to Chicago Public Schools, are certain

9

facilities -- I'm wearing my aldermanic hat here --

10

going to be eliminated because they don't produce

11

the kind of cost savings that would be desirable or

12

the return that would make the projects work?

13

I'm interested in that.

14

So

Secondly, not necessarily a

15

traditional asset but the City's streetlight

16

system, ongoing concerns.

17

streetlights out.

18

us regardless of where we live, work or play.

19

particular reasons why that was not chosen as part

20

of this first round?

21

this point?

22

analyze?

23
24

All of us have seen

It affects each and every one of
Any

Is it just too complicated at

Are these more sure-fire assets to

COMMISSIONER REYNOLDS:

Yes.

Using

ESCOs in a manner such as this is a more tried and

 109
1

true approach.

Just from sitting in meetings as we

2

talked about Retrofit Chicago, I understand that

3

lighting could be on the horizon.

4

lot more work and understanding to do before it's

5

ready to bring forth this project.

6

ALDERMAN POPE:

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

8

your presentation.

9

Thank you.

Thank you very much for

That was really good.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

There's just a

Thank you.

I need to make one comment here.

11

We're at two hours.

12

principally because Diana and I have to participate

13

in the process for potential candidates for our CEO

14

job.

15

involved, get it done other than I think get

16

through these presentations, we have to get to the

17

public comment section, so we need to manage our

18

time accordingly with that in mind.

19

to cut off questions but --

And the only other thing we have to get

20
21

We have to be done by 12:45

MR. HOFFMAN:

Very reasonable, Mr.

Chairman.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

23

MS. TAYLOR:

24

I don't want

All right.

Good.

Good morning.

Unfortunately I don't have much of a voice today.

 110
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

MS. TAYLOR:

Good afternoon now.

I am Pat Taylor, and I am

3

the Chief Operating Officer for the Chicago Public

4

Schools, and we are very greatful to have the

5

opportunity to stand before the Commission today

6

and tell you about our projects.

7

The first slide is really presenting

8

our overall goals and objectives of the

9

initiatives.

We have three initiatives -- one

10

being lighting retrofits, the second energy

11

dashboards, and the third being retro

12

commissioning.

13

The main goals are obviously saving

14

district dollars, increasing condition of classroom

15

lighting, creating local jobs.

16

The next slide speaks more

17

specifically to the scope of the work, and that is

18

basically removing old, inefficient lamps and

19

replacing them with high efficiency lamps, adding

20

in occupancy sensors, changing exit signs over to

21

LED exit signs, and all cracked and broken lenses

22

are being replaced.

23
24

This slide shows the total cost in
savings projections by school type based on bids

 111
1

received by contractors.

2

project is estimated at 19,000,000.

3

Do I have the right --

4

MS. FERGUSON:

5

MS. TAYLOR:

The total cost of the

Yeah.

However, 5 --

This is 14.

Well, it's 19,000,000.

6

However, 5,000,000 of that is coming from IDCEO

7

overhead which then reduces the cost to 14,000,000.

8

I can also mention that there is a potential for an

9

additional 3,000,000 in grants, so then that would

10
11

take it down again.
The energy savings is estimated by

12

taking the actual load reduction from the old

13

system versus the new system multiplying it by the

14

number of hours of operation.

15

Our project team is a team that's

16

already employed by our offices.

17

manager who helps us put the program together, the

18

design manager who puts the drawings together and

19

then our project directors and construction

20

managers helping us to manage the 242 schools that

21

are currently getting the lighting retrofits.

22

It's the program

We started the project in June, and

23

we will have the entire project completed by

24

February 28th, 2013.

 112
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me just ask you -- In

2

that regard, it sounds different from what we heard

3

from the department with the new name.

4

MS. TAYLOR:

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

2FM.
2FM.

Because you, as you

6

say, you're in the middle of it and you're about to

7

be done.

8

lighting project, what, if anything, is

9

contemplated that relates to us and potential

10
11

What, if anything -- With regard to the

private financing?
MS. TAYLOR:

We would hope to be

12

reimbursed for the investment based on the savings

13

that would come back to support that.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

And the process that David

15

was describing regarding either ESCOs or some

16

process to explain how energy savings can be either

17

guaranteed or maintained or verified, with regard

18

to this project that's close to being done, is

19

there something in place from CPS that's similar to

20

that or how should we think about that?

21

MS. TAYLOR:

22

to you about that.

23

energy manager.

24

I'm going to let Brian talk

This is Brian Martin.

MR. HOFFMAN:

He's my

If you were going to get

 113
1

to that later, I didn't mean to interrupt your

2

flow.

3

convenient for you.

You can do it now or later, whatever is

4

MR. MARTIN:

5

Manager of Chicago Public Schools.

6

Brian Martin, Energy

So as of June of this past year

7

we've started on the design and moving into

8

construction.

9

2013.

10

We'll be finalized in February of

As you were talking to the

11

measurement verification for lighting, on a very

12

high level, you're looking at moving a very

13

inefficient lamp and replacing it with a very high

14

efficient lamp at a much lower wattage, but our

15

measurement verifications are all being tied to the

16

Illinois Technical Reference Manual which is a

17

standard manual created by the Illinois

18

Association, Energy Association that was funded by

19

DCO.

20

that identifies measurement verification procedures

21

that can be done for various projects including

22

lighting retrofits, so we have been utilizing that

23

manual for the measurement and verification of our

24

lighting projects.

It's basically transparent, consistent manual

 114
1

Specifically we're looking at

2

existing system wattage versus new system wattage,

3

identifying what that load reduction is,

4

multiplying it by the number of hours for a

5

particular facility.

6

On the occupancy sensor side we're

7

looking at a percentage reduction in hours based

8

off of that technical reference manual.

9

taking an additional step further where we're doing

We're also

10

data logging within a sample set of schools so we

11

can identify if that percentage identified in the

12

Illinois Technical Reference Manual is consistent

13

with what we're seeing in schools with regards to

14

reduction in hours from the occupancy sensors.

15
16

MR. HOFFMAN:
again.

17

MR. MARTIN:

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

19

Tell me your last name

Martin, M-A-R-T-I-N.
You said energy -- Tell me

your title.

20

MR. MARTIN:

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

22

MS. FERGUSON:

23
24

Energy manager.
Thank you.
Can I just get

clarification on one of those?
Pat, you said that CPS would seek to

 115
1

be reimbursed for the capital expenditure related

2

to this phase one, and maybe it's a question for

3

our advisor or something, but is there appetite

4

from the investment community to fund previously

5

conducted projects or completed projects?

6

table that for later perhaps but I'm just -- I'm

7

confused.

8
9
10

MS. TAYLOR:

We can

I have to defer to the City

because we have been in ongoing conversations with
them.

We are moving forward with this.

11

MS. FERGUSON:

We can table the question

12

for now.

In the interest of time, for our advisors

13

maybe earmark that to come back to.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

15

MS. FERGUSON:

It seems different.
Yeah, it is a little

16

different than the previous presentation.

17

why I want to -- But --

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

19

MS. TAYLOR:

That's

Okay.

This slide is the cash flow

20

analysis which you'll see to the right of the slide

21

it is an example of the cash flow analysis that

22

we'll do for every school.

23

to the initial investment -- 19 minus the 5.

24

then the costs were identified through actual bids

It, again, just speaks
And

 116
1

received by contractors for the sites.

2

We did have to estimate costs for

3

approximately 22 of those sites due to the time we

4

were putting this together.

5

finalized.

6

installation.

7

The bids had not been

Cost does include design, materials and

Savings and verification process.

8

Brian has spoken mostly to this already.

Savings

9

are being generated by changing out the old,

10

inefficient lighting systems with low wattage,

11

higher efficiency lighting system.

12

Occupancy sensors will decrease the

13

run hours of the system by shutting off lights when

14

spaces are not in use, and the Illinois State Wide

15

Technical Reference Manual was used to help drive

16

estimates for the occupancy sensor savings.

17

Manual was developed in June of 2012 to provide a

18

transparent and consistent basis for calculating

19

energy savings, so in order to verify the actual

20

dollar savings CPS will monitor each site's weather

21

normalized energy consumption and costs and compare

22

it to previous years weather normalized consumption

23

and costs.

24

ALDERMAN POPE:

Just a technical

The

 117
1

questions.

2

of data.

3

period to see what the true cost savings might be?

4

Is that the standard in the market?

5

2FM indicated they had two years worth

Is CPS also looking at a similar time

MR. MARTIN:

Yeah, we're looking at --

6

We're working on developing a baseline.

7

always looking at three years worth of data.

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

9

MS. TAYLOR:

Three years.

We're

Thank you.

The next project is our --

10

The last slide on this is we're filling in the

11

construction mode right now, and we'll be complete

12

with the lighting retrofits by February 28th.

13

The next project is the energy

14

dashboards.

15

tool that will allow CPS to obtain daily energy

16

consumption and demand at each site.

17

a web-based system that will be accessible to all

18

staff and students.

19

compared to a baseline usage so that schools can

20

identify how their consumption compares this year

21

versus last year, and the picture, again, displayed

22

is just a sample shot of what a dashboard would

23

look like when in place.

24

This is a real-time energy monitoring

This will be

It will display current usage

Part of the thing that's changed for

 118
1

us this year is the engineers report to my group.

2

We have more facility people on the street, and

3

this gives us better control of putting out

4

staffing plans to manage energy.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I'm sorry.

6

step out for a moment.

7

to go do this audit for you?

But you're not using ESCOs

8

MS. TAYLOR:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

I had to

No.
Okay.

Just want to be

sure.

11

MS. TAYLOR:

So the cost estimate at

12

this time is a high level estimate based on the

13

costs from the standard pricing schedule from some

14

dashboard vendors.

15

cost estimate, and better cost assumptions will be

16

available once the proposals are received from our

17

RFP.

18

This is still a very high level

And we are currently also pursuing

19

any grants and/or support from Com Ed and other

20

partners on this effort to help reduce the overall

21

cost and increase the payback.

22

Facility managers and engineers as I

23

mentioned will be held accountable for monitoring

24

and ensuring that their buildings are being

 119
1

scheduled accordingly and any variances in

2

consumption are addressed immediately and

3

corrected.

4

Centrally CPS will monitor and

5

measure each site's weather normalized energy

6

consumption and cost versus the previous year's

7

weather normalized cost -- energy consumption and

8

costs, so by using weather normalized energy data

9

we effectively remove weather related consumption

10

each year.

11

Project status is the scope is being

12

finalized for the RFP, and it's scheduled to hit

13

the streets January 2013.

14

preliminary scope completed by this Friday, and

15

once we have the scope finalized we need to go

16

through our internal review prior to the RFP

17

actually going out.

18

We will have a

The third project is our retro

19

commissioning.

20

building where a contractor is brought in to audit

21

current conditions and provide certain measures

22

that will bring the building system operation back

23

into its original design intent.

24

It's basically a tune-up of a

Retro commissioning will concentrate

 120
1

on identifying energy conservation measures that

2

will provide a payback of up to five years by

3

targeting in on low costs and operational

4

efficiency measures including repair or replacing

5

motors, pumps, building controls and schedules.

6

This method requires contracting with a retro

7

commissioning agent who will assist us, CPS,

8

through the phases of the process including

9

planning, investigation, implementation and then a

10

measurement verification.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm confused.

12

like a description of a process.

13

description of a process.

14

process.

15

MS. TAYLOR:

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

This looks

This looks like a

It seems like a good

Yes.
So my question is:

If --

17

In the subject of what you would be seeking private

18

financing of that would go to the Trust, would that

19

be private financing that relates to the

20

development of this process or --

21

MS. TAYLOR:

It would be for the actual

22

retro commissioning.

This is a part of the three

23

phases that we're doing.

24

We're not as far ahead as two -- We haven't

This is the last phase.

 121
1

identified the schools yet.

2

50 to 100 most inefficient buildings, but there's

3

still some work to be done at CPS before we would

4

bring this to the Commission for funding.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

6

MS. TAYLOR:

We've been looking at

Okay.

Thank you.

So all costs are estimated

7

by CPS top 50 most inefficient facilities using

8

approximately a dollar per square foot in cost, so

9

that $1 to $1.50 derived from sample retro

10

commission projects completed through the IDCEO

11

Retro Commissioning Program.

12

This is still a very high level

13

assumption.

14

would need the assistance of the retro

15

commissioning agent to make those final decisions,

16

and then savings would be estimated using an

17

estimated 15 percent in savings which is based on

18

and derived from other, again, retro commissioning

19

projects through the IDCEO's retro commissioning

20

program.

21

Sites have not been finalized, and we

We are currently working on

22

developing the process which you've seen and the

23

plan for the retro commissioning program with our

24

program management internally and with Com Ed.

 122
1

This project would certainly be a second phase to

2

the first two.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

I have the same question

4

that I asked David, David Reynolds about budget.

5

I'm embarrassed that I don't know this, but is CPS

6

on a calendar year?

7

calendar year?

8
9
10

Is it a fiscal year or

MS. TAYLOR:

No.

Our budget goes from

July 1st through June 30, so we're in, currently in
our FY '13 calendar budget.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

So in that FY '13 capital

12

budget are there any assumptions made that there

13

will be a private financing deal to the Trust,

14

savings, either financing as a result of that or

15

savings on projects that are going through the

16

Trust?

17

MS. TAYLOR:

Our budget currently shows

18

support for all three of these projects as well as

19

savings.

20

Commission didn't come back and help to support

21

with funding, we don't move a project forward

22

unless we actually have the funding in place, so

23

we've included in our budget obviously based on how

24

those, how these projects roll out and how quickly

You would have to -- In case the

 123
1

we would be able to find out would depend on how

2

quickly we'd have to bond to support those funds,

3

and hopefully then we wouldn't have to go through

4

that process.

5

the outside funders, and then the savings would go

6

to outside --

7

We'd recognize a partnership with

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me make sure I

8

understand.

9

included in there that there would be financing

10

In the FY '13 budget there is -- It is

provided for some of these projects --

11

MS. TAYLOR:

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

13
14

No.
-- that's through the

Trust or just in general?
MS. TAYLOR:

We have already put in

15

funding to support the three budget -- The projects

16

in our budget, so they're actually listed in my

17

capital budget right now to seek to be reimbursed.

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

And is the -- In terms of

19

the timing of the FY '13 budget, the year that

20

would start July 1st, is that in development or has

21

that specifically been decided on?

22

MS. TAYLOR:

Our FY '14 budget would

23

have to be up by May 1st, capital budget would

24

anyways, as driven by the --

 124
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

Do you anticipate putting

2

in that budget financing that would go through the

3

Trust or savings that your either, A, financing

4

that comes to the Trust or savings that are assumed

5

from these projects?

6

MS. TAYLOR:

I wouldn't have to put any

7

additional financing in the FY '14 because I've

8

already included the cost to cover all three of the

9

projects in FY '13.

The savings would obviously --

10

If we're not getting funds back from or

11

reimbursement from the Commission, then the savings

12

would be recognized by taking down utility costs.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

In other words, you're

14

doing these projects anyway, and your budget

15

reflects what -- the fact that you are budgeting

16

for internal financing of that, and you're

17

estimating your savings based on what you think

18

they're going to do?

19

MS. TAYLOR:

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

21

MS. TAYLOR:

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

Correct.
Even if we did nothing?
Correct.
And when you say that, you

23

know, if you don't get financing from the

24

Commission, you mean us; right?

 125
1

MS. TAYLOR:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

Correct.
That's not in -- Whether

3

you do or not would not affect the current budget

4

you provide?

5

MS. TAYLOR:

Correct.

Certainly it is

6

our hope to get reimbursed so that we don't have to

7

take it to --

8
9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

understand why you're here.

Obviously I

I just want to figure

10

out whether there are any assumptions that have

11

been made in any of these budget documents.

12

MS. TAYLOR:

Yes.

Our FY '13 budget

13

does cover the projects or we wouldn't have been

14

able to start them.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Along the same lines --

16

You know, I know one of the things that was

17

discussed very briefly was the comparison with the

18

standard private financing markets like bond

19

markets.

20

to potential bond investors that discuss financing

21

from the bond market for any of these energy

22

savings projects?

23
24

Have there been bond presentations by CPS

MS. TAYLOR:

No.

I'm going to say no,

but I actually am going to check back with my chief

 126
1

financial officer and I can get that definitive

2

answer.

3
4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah, and this may be a

different area --

5

MS. TAYLOR:

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.
-- than the COO area.

But

7

one question especially as to CPS is why not just

8

issue bonds.

9

question.

10

That's sort of along the lines of my

Have you already started going down the

road of talking with bond investors?

11

MS. TAYLOR:

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

We have not.
When you talk to the CFO,

13

if you find anything different, would you let us

14

know by e-mail again through Scott or otherwise?

15

MS. TAYLOR:

Absolutely.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

17

MS. FERGUSON:

Thank you very much.
Maybe just to expand on

18

David's question, when you go back to the CFO or

19

the relevant parties at CPS, confirm what has been

20

presented to rating agencies not just bonding.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

22

MS. FERGUSON:

That's right.
That's the specific

23

question -- What has been -- What has CPS presented

24

to rating agencies and potential bond investors on

 127
1

this topic of these financings and the assumptions

2

that David is asking about.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

To be clear, if something

4

has been presented, I would like to see copies --

5

We would like to see copies of that.

6

MS. TAYLOR:

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

8

That would be appreciated.

Thank you.

9
10

Absolutely.

MS. TAYLOR:

Thank you very much.

I

appreciate it.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

While the next presenter

12

is coming, can I get a sense of -- Maybe a show of

13

hands of how many people have public comment?

14
15

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:
left.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

18
19
20

23
24

Everybody left.

Go ahead and ask the

question.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Is there anyone here

because I want to manage our time?

21
22

I think they

(No response.)
Okay.

Let's go.

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

My name is Tom

Powers, and I am the Commissioner for the Chicago

 128
1

Department of Water Management.

2

I've been with the City for 17

3

years.

Started in Transportation.

Actually

4

started out out in the field as a resident engineer

5

on bridge projects.

6

trade and worked myself, worked my way up the

7

ladder, and I moved over to the Water Department in

8

2010, and now we're embarking on one of the largest

9

capital improvement programs certainly in the

I'm a structural engineer by

10

history of Chicago but also in the water industry

11

in general.

12

I usually start off these

13

presentations, give people a little bit of a

14

perspective on what the system entails.

15

So it all starts out with the

16

islands that you see out in the lakes.

17

what we call cribs.

18

from.

19

plants.

20

Those are

That's where we draw the water

They come into our two water purification

The first is the South Plant.

It's

21

down by Rainbow Beach.

22

the time it was the largest conventional water

23

treatment plant in the world.

24

We put it in in 1947.

At

In '64 the City put in the James

 129
1

Jardine Plant right by Navy Pier, and in the spirit

2

of Daniel Burnham, again, it is the largest

3

conventional water treatment plant in the world

4

still today.

5

So between the two plants we treat

6

and pump about 1.2 billion gallons of water every

7

single day.

8

ramifications of that number and what that comes

9

down to.

A lot of people don't understand the

That's synonymous to filling the Sears

10

Tower about five and a half times every single day.

11

That's our capacity.

12

capacity.

13

but that's what we have the ability to do.

We're nowhere near our

We have extra capacity in our system,

14

The way the system works is as I

15

said we draw the water from the lake.

16

into our 2 treatment plants, and then from our

17

treatment plants we have a network of tunnels that

18

reach out to 12 pumping stations throughout the

19

City of Chicago.

20

electrified.

21

so those are important numbers as I go through

22

this.

23
24

It enters

Eight of these stations are

Four of them are still steam powered,

Then there's another really big
point.

The difference between the City of Chicago

 130
1

and say a suburb that most people don't know is

2

that we don't have any water towers.

3

storage in our system.

4

no.

5

our system unlike a suburb that will have a couple

6

days storage, you know, in a water tower.

We have no

We have -- I shouldn't say

We have a very limited amount of storage in

7

Ours is pump on demand which makes

8

these projects very challenging because you have to

9

retrofit them and change them while it's an

10

operating station, so it's very difficult to

11

endeavor.

12

Our network on the water side is

13

4400 miles of water mains.

14

from 16 inches all the way up to 78 inches.

15

They range anywhere

So now we'll focus in on

16

Springfield.

17

Again, it's 1 of our 12 pumping stations, so the

18

pumping stations, what they do is they draw water

19

up out of the tunnels and then they pressurize the

20

local distribution system that then, in turn,

21

services everybody's home.

22

This is Springfield pumping station.

Again, Springfield is one of our

23

four remaining steam stations.

It was last

24

refurbished in the 1950s when we went from coal to

 131
1

steam with the natural gas, and now we are going to

2

switch it over to electricity.

3

It's located in -- almost at North

4

Avenue and Springfield, so right near the northwest

5

side there.

And our -- We serve not just the City

6

of Chicago.

We serve water to 41 percent of the

7

state.

8

direct connects or secondary or tertiary connects

9

in the network, so we have basically a very

10

One hundred twenty-five suburbs either

reliable system of customers in our customer base.

11

In the '50s the way it worked was

12

you bring in the natural gas.

13

would power a boiler.

14

steam, and it would turn a turbine, and it would

15

turn a pump.

16

takes awhile to basically build up that pressure.

17

In order to run that turbine you have to have two

18

boilers running at any given time in case the first

19

one fails because you can't just turn a switch and

20

expect that pressure to be there.

21

The natural gas

The boiler would generate

The challenge here is because it

However, with an electrical system,

22

we would pull a Com Ed feed.

We have a high

23

efficiency variable speed drive.

24

a dimmer on a light switch.

It's kind of like

You can turn it up and

 132
1

off.

Then we have a high efficiency induction

2

motor which is basically -- It's a more efficient

3

motor, but it's also a more reliable motor which

4

then turns a pump and pressurizes the system.

5

So the goal of the Springfield

6

Avenue pumping station is to, is basically

7

reduction.

8

reduction of manpower.

9

maintenance.

It's reduction of energy.

It's

Reduction of ongoing

It's an improvement in our carbon

10

footprint, and it gives us the ability to monitor

11

and control this station remotely from our control

12

center.

13

So this project is currently under

14

way.

We're about 20 percent complete with

15

construction.

16

we're replacing an entire station while it's

17

operating, so we're taking part of it out of

18

service, and we're eliminating -- We're removing

19

some of our redundancy now during construction, and

20

it will all be put back in service at the end of

21

the project in 2015.

22

Again, what we're doing here is

So we're demolishing the old

23

buildings, the old boiler stacks, the boiler system

24

itself.

We're constructing a new electrical

 133
1

building, and we're actually going for a silver

2

LEED certification on that building.

3

we're installing variable speed drives, and this is

4

one of the most green water pumping stations in

5

North America, so we're installing a green roof and

6

solar panels as part of this project.

7

A little bit about the costs on, the

8

existing costs to the station.

9

electrical costs --

10
11

MR. HOFFMAN:

There are

One second.

Part of the

construction?

12

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

14

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

16

As I said,

Excuse me?

The construction?
Yes.

So this is a project

that's ongoing?

17

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

That is correct.

And just to get a handle

19

on the documents that might describe it, was there

20

one or multiple RFPs or low bid issue that then

21

resulted in the choice of contractors who worked on

22

the project?

23
24

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

That's correct.

We went through the standard procurement process

 134
1

with the City of Chicago, advertised in the

2

newspaper for the contractor, and the lowest bid,

3

the lowest responsible bidder was selected.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

So you issued one spec

5

that then resulted in the contractor chosen who's

6

running this project?

7

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

That's correct.

Can you have -- Similarly

as I asked about the RFP that was issued, can I get

10

e-mailed another copy of that spec?

11

might have been a year or more in the past when it

12

was issued, but that would be interesting to see

13

that description in the spec of the project.

14
15

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

I gather it

Sure.

We can

provide that.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

17

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

18

Thank you, Tom.
Sure.

Again, we have electrical costs

19

associated with the operation of the existing

20

system.

21

the building.

22

pumping station is run primarily through natural

23

gas.

24

for 2011 and 2012 obviously are not over, so we

That's the secondary tertiary systems in
By and large, as I said before, the

Last year or in 2011 -- All the (inaudible)

 135
1

spent about $2,000,000 on natural gas last year, so

2

the total cost to run the station in 2011 was about

3

$2.1 million just in energy costs alone.

4

Now when we look forward -- After we

5

convert the station we actually have data we can

6

draw on because as I said before eight of our

7

current stations are already electrified, so the

8

way that we looked at what are the actual energy

9

savings, we looked at what it costs for those eight

10

stations on average to pump a million gallons of

11

water, and it's about $43.28 to pump a million

12

gallons of water.

13

energy savings -- I need to do the math.

14

going to waste everyone's time -- of nearly

15

$1,000,000 just in energy savings alone, so that's

16

part of the savings on retrofitting this station.

17

Based on that we came up with an
I'm not

The second portion of it is -- So

18

you have the energy savings.

You also have -- As I

19

said before, you have the personnel savings, and

20

then you also have maintenance savings.

21

personnel side, currently as I said before, these

22

are pump on demand stations, so that means they're

23

manned 24/7 365.

24

There's no Thanksgiving holidays.

So the

There's no Christmas holidays.
We're the dopes

 136
1

that are out there all day long every day.

2

As I said, people don't understand

3

the value of water until that water main breaks out

4

in front of their house, so, you know, there are a

5

number of (inaudible) for these folks.

6

Currently we have a staff of 33.

7

I said, multiple shifts on each 1 of these 4

8

stations, but in this case it's 33.

9

convert the station over, we'll be able to pull

10

those people out of that station and we can drop

11

that number of positions down to six.

12

we have a reduction in 27 FTEs for a savings of

13

about 2.9 based on our 2012 salaries.

14

As

When we

So, again,

Then this is the breakdown of what

15

trades will be pulled out of that station and then

16

their subsequent salaries and these savings as

17

well.

18

On the maintenance side, as I said,

19

Springfield was put in service back in the '50s,

20

and there's a lot of maintenance.

21

the edge, the end of its useful life.

22

about half a million dollars on boiler maintenance,

23

another 100,000 on turbine and chemicals, and then

24

post conversion we'll still see some maintenance

It's reaching
We spend

 137
1

required on an electrical station but it's not

2

nearly the same order of magnitude.

3

anticipate over a half a million dollar savings on

4

operational maintenance that will be -- we won't

5

have to do anymore.

6

So we

Again, we have almost $1,000,000 in

7

energy.

We have 2.9 in personnel and half a

8

million in maintenance for a total of about $4.46

9

million annually by converting this station.

10

Questions?

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

12

Morsch.

13

other Tom?

I have a question for Tom

Can you come up, Tom, and stand with the

14

MR. MORSCH:

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.
That was a very good

16

presentation, and I appreciate the clarity of it.

17

I think I have at least a decent understanding of

18

the project, the expected savings and so on.

19

that was -- So then I suppose the challenge

20

obviously for the finance folks, PFM, the City, us

21

is to think about whether that can translate into

22

how investors would react if there was going to be

23

a private financing deal, and I know that a big

24

percentage of the expected savings comes from

So

 138
1

personnel savings, so different from we put this in

2

and our energy costs will be lower.

3

it.

4

MR. MORSCH:

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's part of

Yes.
And this can be very

6

preliminary.

Just a couple minutes.

But in your

7

experience in seeing these kind of deals around the

8

country and around the world, is -- Have you seen

9

that before where a substantial amount of the

10

savings is coming from expected personnel savings

11

and that translates into private financing deals or

12

is that going to be out of the ordinary and

13

significantly different than the typical private

14

financing deals in this area?

15

MR. MORSCH:

That's a good question.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

If you don't know, you

17
18

don't know.
MR. MORSCH:

Well, I would say that I

19

don't have a great knowledge of that.

I would say

20

in the same way there's a commitment to deposit

21

savings from energy there could be a similar

22

commitment to deposit savings from personnel, so

23

that's really a better question for Tom and how he

24

manages his department and what commitments he's

 139
1

willing to make and how investors look through to

2

his commitment.

3

You see what I mean?

MR. HOFFMAN:

I do.

I think that one

4

interesting thing which I don't think we have time

5

to discuss now, so I think we can just sort of peg

6

it for the future, although I know I want to hear

7

more about this later, is when we think about risk

8

and we think about it just in terms of energy

9

savings, one of the things we're hearing back is,

10

well, we have a certain amount of control and

11

really when we make an estimate we'll have a lot of

12

control whether that estimate comes true, so

13

applying those same sort of thoughts to personnel,

14

one question will be is there really complete

15

control.

16

sure that we'll be able to reduce the work force

17

and this way we'll get these savings.

18

imagine responses where you don't have that

19

control, and there's going to be uncertainty about

20

whether those personnel savings will materialize.

21

The answer may be absolutely, we know for

But I can

I think to Tom's point, I think he's

22

right that those are questions we'll have to

23

address to the operating departments to say, you

24

know, what are the, what would be the uncertainties

 140
1
2

in that area of estimate of savings.
COMMISSIONER POWERS:

Well, the

3

uncertainties I guess would be -- The way I would

4

envision this is as we start turning this station

5

over, we will be moving these people that are

6

currently in the station out and then not hire

7

people back to attrition elsewhere in the

8

Department, so we would want to keep the employees,

9

the knowledgeable employees that we have in the

10

Department and we would defer -- Or not defer.

We

11

would not hire replacement people through

12

attrition, so that's something that I would have to

13

talk to the Budget Director about, how to

14

acknowledge that, and how you would have a line in

15

the budget on something like that.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

So I would just say this

17

is probably going to be a developing story?

18

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

Absolutely.

And I would say that

20

whatever we will need, and I would imagine the

21

investor will need to dig in the details of this,

22

if this is part of the return on investment.

23

would say if you haven't already had folks

24

internally digging in on a more integral level than

I

 141
1

that that would probably be necessary.

2

that I can imagine there would be a lot of

3

uncertainty on that, but I'd be happy to hear in

4

the future.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think

Typically, I will say

6

this though, typically in an industry you would see

7

those three components of savings.

8

significant productivity when you're upgrading and

9

maintaining a piece of equipment.

You have

You could see

10

better operating costs.

11

needed to do it and maintenance costs to do it.

12

Typically you'd see it.

13

normally plays out here.

14

You would see fewer people

I don't know how it

But, again, let's all be clear.

15

What this is going to convert to is the risk

16

posture that goes to that single entity, and it's

17

going to convert to what kind of pricing is going

18

to be in the marketplace.

19

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Understood.

The more assurance we

21

have the better probability we're going to have to

22

get the deal.

23

risk is just too great nobody is going to be

24

interested in buying it.

They will get to a point where the

 142
1

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

Okay.

Understood.
Thank you.

Any other questions?

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Is that 73 -- I think it's

5

$73,000,000 in terms of the cost, is that -- How

6

set is that cost?

7

COMMISSIONER POWERS:

Well, that

8

$73,000,000 also includes the initial design of the

9

station that transpired about three years ago.

10

That's pretty set.

11

we're 21 percent complete with the job, and we're

12

on budget with that project.

13
14
15

We're on schedule.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

As I said,

Thank you very

much.
I'm going to go to public comment to

16

see if there is any because we only have ten

17

minutes basically left.

18
19
20
21

Not seeing any then I will go back.
Let the record show there was none.
Go back to other business first.
there any other business?

22

(No response.)

23
