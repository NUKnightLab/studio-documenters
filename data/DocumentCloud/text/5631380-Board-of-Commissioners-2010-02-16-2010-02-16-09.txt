FUNDING
N/A

EXPLANATION
HUD uses the Performance Funding System (PFS) to determine a public housing authority’s
eligibility for an operating subsidy, in accordance with Section 9(a) of the U.S. Housing Act of
1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437g. The PFS is applicable to all public housing authority owned units under
an Annual Contributions Contract. The CHA is required to submit a PFS Calculation detailing
the total operating subsidy for fiscal year 2010. Based on the formula established by HUD as a
part of the Amended and Restated Moving-to-Work Demonstration Agreement (“Amended and
Restated MTW Agreement”), Attachment A, the CHA should request the operating subsidy in
the amount of $174,119,556. This figure was determined by using the formula described in
Attachment A of the Amended and Restated MTW Agreement.
For fiscal years 2000-2017, CHA must prepare its request for operating funds by making
adjustments to the base year subsidy eligibility. Attachment A of the Amended and Restated
MTW Agreement states that CHA’s base year is CHA’s FY1999 subsidy eligibility level of
$176,451,193. The formula includes making adjustments to the base year amount by using a
Simplified Delta of .005, the PFS annual inflation factor for Chicago (which is 2.8% for
FY2010), Total Unit Months available for the reporting period July 1, 2008 through June 30,
2009 taking into account both new units added and units removed from its inventory during that
time, and congressional appropriations (i.e., pro-ration of subsidy when less than 100% funding
of operating subsidy).
Unlike the procedure used in prior years, HUD has requested each Authority to submit its PFS
Schedule prior to the release of final pro-rations. This is being done in order to determine the
overall need of Public Housing Authorities. Upon release of the final pro-ration amount, the
CHA’s FY2010 Comprehensive Budget will be adjusted accordingly.
