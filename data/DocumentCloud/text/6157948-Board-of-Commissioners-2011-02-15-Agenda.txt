COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE
REQUEST TO AMEND A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED CONTRACT AMENDMENT
ITEM #12
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 6, 2011 from
ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
requesting that the Board of Commissioners approve as amended the following item with JP Morgan
Chase Bank, Chicago, Illinois, which was previously approved on the October 5, 2010 Board Agenda,
(New Item # 3).
The amendment is indicated by the underscored and stricken language.
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 29, 2010 from
ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to include the Department of Revenue and amend
Contract No. 05-43-197 with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., Chicago, Illinois, awarded by the Cook
County Board on September 21, 2004 and subsequently renewed on April 9, 2008 through a Request for
Proposal (RFP) process to provide lockbox services. The contract shall be amended to reflect virtual
remote deposit services and online e-payments acceptance for Bureau of Administration agencies, Office
of the Sheriff, Real Estate Management Division, Bureau of Finance, Bureau of Technology, Department
of Administrative Hearings and various County Ordinances which require the Department of Revenue to
collect payments.
Reason:

This request will provide acceleration and efficiency of the revenue collection process,
which is critical to meet both goals of following best practices and meeting industry
standards for Cook County. Lockbox service and e-payment solutions will expedite the
collection of the current paper-based payments. Currently, Department of Revenue
personnel manually process 100,000 transactions in-house. Furthermore, lockbox service
and e-payment solutions will provide a cost savings to the Department of Revenue.
Additional benefits include better payment and posting accuracy, improve cash flow by
reducing processing time, image retrieval and archiving, provide an option for electronic
connectivity for taxpayers and re-assign current compliance resources to their designated
job functions.

REQUEST TO AMEND A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED CONTRACT AMENDMENT continued
ITEM #12 cont’d
Funding for the lockbox is achieved through both a cost and interest accrued.
Compensating balances and the amount the County will pay has an inverse relationship.
While interest rates are at a historic low, the County will have a payment obligation,
however, when the interest market is reinvigorated and rates begin to climb, the actual
charge to the County will decrease. Based on historical analysis, it is believed that
compensating balances will fund the entire expense of this operation over time.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: Total contract cost is approximately $162,000.00 funded through both a
compensating balances and a line item allocation ,in the event compensating balances do not fund the
stated contract cost, the contract cost will be netted against collected revenue. The net cost to the County
will not exceed $83,000.00 for FY 2011 and FY 2012. Contract period: October 5, 2010 through
January 31, 2013. (007-244 Account). Requisition No. 0070015.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012 funds.

GREG WASS, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Technology
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Pro-West & Associates,
Inc., Walker, Minnesota, for application development and automation of data that will coordinate
business work flow primarily between the offices of the Department of Building and Zoning and the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
Reason:

The objective of this project is to streamline workflows between Building & Zoning and the
Zoning Board of Appeals. This project will automate the process for handling requests for
zoning changes and permits, inventory of existing municipal zoning ordinances, creation of a
web-based application for municipalities to report zoning changes, and the development of a
countywide zoning permit application that is integrated into the County’s enterprise GIS
environment. Based on an RFP for the selection of a vendor to develop a zoning workflow
management application and related services, award is being recommended based on
ProWest’s technical solution, expertise and ability to meet all of the County’s specifications.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $657,112.00. Contract period:
(717/545-579 Account). Requisition No. 15450002.

PROPOSED CONTRACT ADDENDUM continued
ITEM #27 cont’d
Reason:

In 2008, Cook County entered into a three (3) year lease agreement with IBM for the use of a
mainframe computer. The current lease agreement provides an end of lease "option-tobuy" the mainframe at a significantly reduced cost rather than enter into another three year
lease agreement. Also, mainframe technology is outdated and newer technologies are built to
run in open server/thin-client systems. The expiration date of the current contract is February
20, 2011.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $397,280.00. (714/012-579 Account).
This item was included in the 2010 Capital Equipment Program approved by the Board of Commissioners
on November 19, 2009.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
PROPOSED CONTRACT AMENDMENT
ITEM #28
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 26, 2011 from
GREG WASS, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Technology
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend Contract No. 08-45-256 with Securus
Technologies, Inc., Dallas, Texas, for the Coinless Inmate & Public Pay Telephone Equipment and
Services by adding coinless telephone equipment and services to the Juvenile Detention Center facilities,
create inmate debit accounts, and implement a simplified rate structure.
Reason:

Juvenile Facility Project – Securus will provide the equipment/Applications in connection
with the Secure Call Platform (SCP) services needed to support the required number and type
of phones and other components and storage.
Inmate Debit Accounts – Upon the successful implementation of Voice Biometrics, it is the
County’s intent to install Debit accounts. This allows the inmates to call anyone and provides
inmates the option of immediately paying for and making calls. Secure pins will be provide
for easy investigation of calls and complaints, it enhances reporting capabilities and reduces
administrative costs.
Simplified Rates – rates at Cook County today are based on AT&T rates that were
previously in place. The current structure is extremely complicated for inmates and their
families. A simplified rate plan will reduce complaints, reduce fraud, eliminates the need to
use illegal remote call forwarding services and increase County revenues by an estimated
$623,000.00 annually.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period: December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2012.
