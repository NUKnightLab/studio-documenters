Funding Source: General Fund
Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology, presented. Nan Baker asked why there are no
additional funds required for this extension of time and what will be the estimated costs through
6/28/2019 for this specific implementation. Maggie Keenan stated that historically, no cost amendments
appeared on the consent agenda and the Office of Budget and Management has recommended that these
begin to appear as regular agenda items; stated that the use of any unspent original funds should be
discussed and brought to the Board for a vote rather than the money going back to respective balances,
as it should not be assumed that unspent funds could be reallocated for other purposes without
authorization. Ms. Baker expressed her appreciation for the recommendation as it will promote fiscal
accountability. Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-259
was unanimously approved.

Funding Source: 70% - Health and Human Services Levy and 30% - Title IV-E
Robert Math, Cuyahoga Job and Family Services on behalf of the Department of Health and Human
Services/Division of Children and Family Services, presented. Joseph Nanni asked for clarification that
there will be an in-house attorney from the Law Department dedicated to providing legal representation
for families once this contract has ended and asked if there are there any potential conflicts with the
agency while representing the child. Maggie Keenan clarified that the representation will only apply to
educational matters for children in custody; and asked Lisa Averyhart, Law Department, if this new
position will be added to the Law Department and will be working exclusively in the Department of Health
and Human Services. Dale Miller asked why the County is not continuing with The Legal Aid Society of
Cleveland and expressed his concern about increasing the existing heavy workload of the Law
Department; and asked if there is the potential to save money by providing services in-house. Ms. Keenan
indicated that she does not believe there will be the potential for savings as in-school legal services will
include travel time and does not believe this approach is in our best interest. Nan Baker asked if this
transition will occur at the end of the contract and is it the intention that funds in the contract will be
utilized until exhausted. Mr. Nanni asked if this position with the Law Department was posted for this
specific purpose. Ms. Keenan stated that the new attorney was hired specifically for the Division of
Children and Family Services. Maggie Keenan motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded.
Item BC2019-263 was unanimously approved as amended.

coordination of (2) solar Co-ops to provide solar energy outreach and training services to residents of
Cuyahoga County for the period 3/25/2019 – 3/31/2020, by deleting the sole source termini and adding
an RFP exemption as the procurement process:
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ44908, which will result in an award recommendation to Solar
United Neighbors Corporation in the amount not-to-exceed $25,000.00 for implementation and
coordination of (2) solar Co-ops to provide solar energy outreach and training services to residents of

Funding Source: Sustainability Projects Fund

 Mike Foley, Director, Department of Sustainability, presented. Dale Miller asked why this was determined
to be an RFP exemption rather than a sole source purchase. Lenora Lockett stated that the request
submitted and presented by the department met the criteria for an RFP exemption and receipt of the sole
source affidavit after the fact, does not comply with the County Code requirements as a sole source
procurement process.
Mr. Miller asked if the sole source or RFP exemption process will be requested, if there is a subsequent
contract. Ms. Lockett stated that a formal, full and open competitive process is always the preferred
method and if that is not the case, then all options will be considered at that time. Nan Baker asked for
clarification on what qualifies as a sole source provider and asked if this vendor meets that criteria. Ms.
Lockett stated that the criteria for sole source includes the vendor certifying by affidavit that they are a
sole source provider of the required service, as well as the department determining this is the only vendor
that can meet the project’s needs; and further stated that the services must be posted for 5 days to ensure
that no other vendors come forward to contradict the vendor’s claim of being a sole source provider. Ms.
Baker recommended that the sole source process be used next time.
Ms. Lockett stated that if the department’s request had met sole source criteria, it would have been
presented as a sole source purchase on the agenda but had instead had been submitted as an RFP
exemption; and indicated that briefings prepared by department’s offer their perspective on the purchase
but the caption on the agenda is the Office of Procurement & Diversity’s proposal, as approved at the
Executive Review Meeting, as to the actual requirements that were met.
Mr. Miller concurred with Ms. Baker’s recommendation to use a sole source process next time. Dale Miller
motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-264 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-265
Department of Sustainability,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption, which will result in a payment to Cleveland 2030 District in the amount

b) Recommending a payment to Cleveland 2030 District in the amount of $5,000.00 for operational
support to promote energy efficiency and conservation for the period 6/12/2019 – 5/31/2020.

seconded. Item BC2019-265 was unanimously approved.

 BC2019-266
