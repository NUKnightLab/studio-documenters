Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided additional information regarding request
numbers 4 and 5. He stated that requests will be presented in December for the provision of a transition period
that will allow for the continuation of the existing vendors’ services for the first three months of calendar year
2014 while the administration on-boards its new back office third party administrator. He noted that the
vendors have not yet been identified for the new contracts that will follow the transition period; the
administration is still negotiating and reviewing the responses to the Requests for Proposals (RFPs).

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
The Committee continued to discuss request numbers 4 and 5. Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, noted
that, as the CountyCare membership increases, the costs will also increase, because the members will utilize
the benefits under their plan, which is normal and expected. Board Chairman Carvalho indicated that some of
the confusion surrounding the issue of increased costs for services relating to CountyCare lies in potentially
conflicting statements that require further explanation and clarification. One statement that has been made is
that enrolling patients into CountyCare benefits the System, because the System is going to get revenues for
people it is already serving. Another statement that has been made is that if the System has been serving those
patients already, then the cost of serving them has been built into its numbers. When costs for CountyCare go
up, this conflicts with that statement; however, new CountyCare members include patients who are new to the
System and patients already served by the System – this detail reconciles the two statements. He noted that
one of the nice things about CountyCare is that the System is bringing in many people who are new to the
System.
Chairman Butler inquired regarding the recent enrollment figures that are being communicated by the federal
authorities relative to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Mr. Glass stated that, among the many provisions of
the ACA, the marketplace is the private insurance component of the ACA; the ACA also provided for an
expansion of the Medicaid Program - CountyCare is the expansion of the Medicaid Program. What is being
communicated in the media regarding the website and enrollment figures for the marketplace is the component
relating to the private insurance marketplace.
During the discussion of request number 8, Dr. Bala Hota, System Chief Information Officer, provided
additional information. He stated that Information Technology (IT) is basically supported by three main
contracts with the following vendors: Siemens, which supports revenue cycle and financial back-end systems;
Cerner, which is the System’s primary vendor for electronic health records; and Xerox, which represents
staffing, implementation, and specialized expertise services. Cerner is the vendor chosen for the certified
electronic record system. As the federal government has moved toward regulating and providing guidelines
for Meaningful Use and integration into one electronic record, which is the roadmap that most organizations
are following, from a technology perspective, the Cerner contract covers all of the software that needed to meet
regulatory requirements for the next three years; he noted that there is a detailed roadmap for the System’s
implementation plan to meet those requirements. The Xerox contract is for the specialized expertise and the
personnel to do that implementation. This request presented today covers that roadmap plus special projects
that are anticipated as a result of the ACA; additionally, there are several other strategic objectives for IT,
including those relating to user experience to make enhancements beyond what the electronic record supports,
making workflows easier, and regarding regulatory and quality requirements.
Dr. Raju stated that he has instructed the Supply Chain Department, as well as the various sponsors of
contractual requests, that every contract henceforth will have periodic performance reviews every three or six
months regarding goals and the objectives reached; there will be discussions with the vendors regarding
whether they have achieved the goals or not, which will be taken into consideration if they want to extend the
contract into the future. Ms. Besenhofer provided additional information on the subject. She stated that
vendors will be required to actually come in to show the administration what they have achieved. There will
be evaluation forms that will be completed by the department heads as to the vendor’s performance throughout
the entire year; at year end or at contract end, those forms will be reviewed to evaluate performance, to
determine if the vendor is the best business partner or whether the administration needs to look elsewhere.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
During the discussion of request number 14, which was a request to execute a contract with McKesson for
services pertaining to denials by third party payers for those admissions that are not medically necessary,
Board Chairman Carvalho requested that updates on how the System is doing with medical denials be
incorporated into the reports provided by John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Hammock, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 15. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare
Mr. Glass provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare. He
stated that, at the end of October, just over 119,000 applications have been initiated; this represents an increase
of 11,000 from the month before.
The majority of applications (66%) continue to be initiated through the call center, the on-campus application
assistors and other program vendors; 29% have been initiated from the CountyCare network partners; and the
remaining 6% are initiated from work at Cermak Health Services, within the Cook County Department of
Corrections.
Over 87,000 applications have been submitted to the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) for
processing at this time; the approval rating remains around 85%.
There was a slight decrease in the average number of applications submitted to DHS per work day in October
to 474; the State processed an average of 525 applications per work day in October. This is the second month
in a row that the number of applications processed daily by DHS has surpassed the average number of
applications submitted per day. This reduced the back-log of applications by 484 from the month prior; it is
estimated that just over 27,000 applications remained unprocessed at month’s end.
Mr. Glass informed the Committee that this month and over the next several months, there will be several
requests coming to the Finance Committee and Board of Directors related to CountyCare’s transition from an
1115 Waiver. These requests will range from ensuring existing agreements meet the current demands of the
program like those presented at this meeting, to requests for continuation of existing agreements, to
establishment of new agreements, including a contract with the State in support of CountyCare’s continued
operations. He noted that, at this month’s full Board meeting, he is scheduled to provide a broad overview of
the Managed Care Department, which includes CountyCare; he will be discussing the upcoming requests in
more detail at that time.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #2)
A. Financial Reports – through September 2013 (Attachment #3)
Mr. Cookinham presented the Financial Reports through September 2013, and provided a presentation
regarding improving financial reporting. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
In response to an inquiry from Board Chairman Carvalho regarding the self-pay population, Mr. Cookinham
stated that the self-pay population includes those people who have not applied for CareLink or CountyCare,
and in some cases have actually paid the System money for services rendered. Board Chairman Carvalho
inquired whether this population is almost assuredly eligible for CareLink, but do not get processed. Mr.
Cookinham responded affirmatively; he stated that the administration hopes to come back to the Committee
with some revisions to the policies to address that issue. Board Chairman Carvalho stated that the Committee
has discussed in the past the question of when should the System require everybody to go through the charity
care policy. The administration has made a very good argument that, with all the other balls in the air,
budgeting, staffing and performing that function is not a priority, if, at the end of the day, the only benefit
achieved is that it will present the charity care numbers more accurately. At the time, the decision was right to
not press the issue of processing everybody like every other hospital in the country does. However, when the
challenges of implementing the ACA pause, that subject will need to be addressed again.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to accept the Financial
Reports through September 2013. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Butler declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

Improving Financial Reporting
•

CCHHS is treated as an enterprise fund that is included in the financial 
reporting of Cook County As an enterprise fund CCHHS prepares its
reporting of Cook County.  As an enterprise fund, CCHHS prepares its 
financial statements similar to a private sector business.  The monthly 
CCHHS financial statements  are prepared in accordance with GAAP and 
on an accrual basis of accounting.

•

Accrual accounting recognizes revenue when it is earned and expenses 
when they are incurred.

•

Cook County government uses a modified accrual concept to report its 
operations.  This is essentially a cash based system of reporting and 
budgeting.

•

The difference in the different basis of reporting used by the county 
government and CCHHS often creates reports that seem to be in conflict.

•

CCHHS currently provides two financial reports each month.  One report is 
a traditional set of accrual financial statements The second report is a
a traditional set of accrual financial statements.  The second report is a 
review of various operational statistics and performance items.

•

The Finance Committee has asked in the past to modify the financial 
p
y
statements to include a comparison to the CCHHS budget.

•

The CCHHS budget is a cash based budget where the revenue is essentially 
the cash collections received in a fiscal year and a matching appropriation
the cash collections received in a fiscal year and a matching appropriation 
of what is expected to be paid in the fiscal year. The CCHHS budget must 
be balanced.

•

The CCHHS budget does not include depreciation, a full estimate of 
insurance expense, pension funding, and the cost of services provided by 
other County departments.

• CCHHS will begin to produce two new statements

• CCHHS will continue to improve the usefulness of its 
financial reporting.  The new reports will provide a 
valid comparison to the approved budget.
• A comparison of the traditional statements to the two 
new statements will also allow the reader to see the 
differences in each approach
differences in each approach.
• CCHHS will continue to enhance its traditional financial

year there will be additional information added to the 
accrual based financial statements.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended September 30, 2013. This discussion
focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current
month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of
the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

September-2013 reduced by 17 to 105 days. Additionally, there was a 3 day decrease in
this figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including 1115 waiver
and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $26.103M (8.9%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure decreased by $15.170M (4.5%). The decline in this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are
completing the collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.

Page 40 of 71

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of September-2013 increased
by $2.011M (22.8%), as compared the November 30, 2012 balance and decreased by
$0.585M (-5.1%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that more
inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of September-2013 increased by $14.821M (9.5%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure fell by $11.552M (-6.3%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that a greater number of accounts are being
removed from active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $2.677M (-15.4%) by the end
of September-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30,
2012. This balance, as of the end of this month, was $1.133M (8.4%) larger than the
previous month’s balance. This indicates that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a
“Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.

Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of September-2013 grew by
$11.281M (8.1%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is
$3.617M (-2.4%) less than last month’s figure.
The decline in this figure indicates that more Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Operating Expenses at the end of ten months was $815.630M broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $423.642M
Benefits - $115.593M
Supplies - $91.947M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $138.873M
Insurance - $9.789M
Depreciation - $28.293M
Utilities - $7.494M

 Nonoperating Revenue was $262.493M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
cigarette tax in the amount of $99.813M and property tax in the amount of $66.226M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.
