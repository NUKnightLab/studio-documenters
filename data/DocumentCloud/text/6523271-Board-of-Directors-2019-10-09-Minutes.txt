PROJECTS
Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Land Transfer Agreement for Junction McGraw
Site and Accept Funds
Ms. Bridges presented the Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Land Transfer Agreement
for Junction McGraw Site and Accept Funds to the DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, the City of Detroit (the “City”) administration has requested the assistance of the
City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) in industrial land assembly activities aimed at
establishing market-ready industrial sites within City limits in order to attract manufacturing and logistics
companies (the “Land Assembly Project”).
In connection with the project recently approved relating to Fiat Chrysler’s (“FCA”) new and expanded
facilities in the area of Mack and Conner and Jefferson and Conner (the “FCA Project”), DBRA staff have
identified a site located at McGraw Avenue and I-94, west of Warren Avenue in Detroit, MI (as depicted on
Exhibit A and hereinafter referred to as the “Junction McGraw Site”) as a location which is ideal to support
the ancillary growth of additional suppliers that will service the FCA Project through supplier contracts.
Currently, ownership of these parcels is vested in the City and the Economic Development Corporation of
the City of Detroit (the “EDC”) (collectively, the “City Property” and which are more particularly described
on Exhibit B attached hereto) and the Detroit Land Bank Authority (“DLBA”) (the “DLBA Property” which
are more particularly described on Exhibit C attached hereto).
Subject to City Council approval, DBRA staff seeks the Board’s approval to negotiate and execute a land
transfer agreement between the DBRA and the City (the “Land Transfer Agreement”) allowing the DBRA
to accept title to the City Property, and all parcels now or hereinafter owned by the City, or the EDC, within
the Junction McGraw Site for a purchase price equal to the City assessor’s land value for each City
Property, payable upon the sale of the City Property to a third-party developer and/or end user. It is
contemplated that the Board would be asked to approve the execution of a land transfer agreement

 between the DBRA and DLBA at a later date upon the identification and selection of a third-party developer
and/or end user to develop the Junction McGraw Site.
Further, DBRA staff also seeks the Board’s approval to accept up to $370,000 in funding from the EDC that
was held by the EDC in connection with a former project plan affecting the Junction McGraw Site, to be
used for the Land Assembly Project, or such other permissible use as approved in writing by the Director
of the Planning and Development Department.
A resolution approving the following was attached for the Board’s consideration: i) negotiation and execution
of a Land Transfer Agreement between the DBRA and the City for the City Property, ii) acceptance of up
to $370,000 in additional funds for the Land Assembly Project or such other permissible use as approved
in writing by the Director of the Planning and Development Department.
Ms. Navin stated that the funding available is an amount up to $370,000 but the exact amount of the funding
is still to be determined.
Mr. George asked if any of the parcels included in the Junction McGraw Site are currently owned by the
Moroun family. Ms. Bridges stated that there are not any parcels included in the Junction McGraw Site are
currently owned by the Moroun family and that the privately-owned parcels in the Junction McGraw Site
are owned by Friedman.
Ms. DeSantis asked if this land assembly effort is related to suppliers for FCA. Ms. Bridges confirmed that
this land assembly effort is related to suppliers for FCA.
Ms. DeSantis asked what will happen to existing structures on the site. Ms. Bridges stated that the land is
currently vacant with no structures.
Mr. Scott asked for examples for what the funding from the EDC may be used for. Ms. Navin stated that
the funding may be used for surveys, environmental work, and other due diligence.
Mr. Walters asked who the anticipated owner will be for the land. Ms. Bridges stated that the DBRA will
hold the land and will enter into an agreement with the future land owner.
Ms. DeSantis asked if this site is part of a larger planning strategy due to the large amount of vacant
residential land. Ms. Bridges stated that due to the proximity of the properties to industrial uses, many
former residents left their residences. Ms. Bridges added that a community meeting was held three weeks
ago to inform the current residents who reside north of McGraw of the potential plans for the site.
Ms. Wilkins asked what the anticipated future use of the site is. Ms. Bridges stated that currently the
anticipated future use of the site is for a supplier for FCA whose operations are sequencing related.
Ms. Wilkins asked who would be able to ensure that the proposed future use will happen on the site. Ms.
Bridges stated that the DBRA will hold the land and that certain uses aren’t permitted on the property due
to regulations. Mr. Walters added that there are certain companies and industries that are being pursued
by the City of Detroit to locate their operations in the City of Detroit.
Ms. DeSantis asked if there is significant environmental remediation needed on the site. Ms. Bridges stated
that the next item on the agenda is related to the environmental due diligence for the site.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Land
Transfer Agreement for Junction McGraw Site and Accept Funds, as presented. The Board took the
following action:
On a motion by Mr. Scott, seconded by Mr. Gonzalez, DBRA Resolution Code 19-10-262-29 was
unanimously approved.
Land Assembly Project: Engagement of Environmental Firm

 Mr. Dailey presented the Land Assembly Project: Engagement of Environmental Firm to the DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, the City of Detroit administration has requested the assistance of the City of Detroit
Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) in industrial land assembly activities aimed at establishing
market-ready industrial sites within City limits in order to attract manufacturing and logistics companies (the
“Land Assembly Project”).
A current Land Assembly Project includes an assemblage at 5555 McGraw and 5301 Junction including
adjacent parcels totaling 27 acres (the “Junction McGraw Site”). The site is being prepared for a future
industrial development that requires requisite site readiness activities for environmental and geotechnical
assessments. The assessments will provide crucial information to market the site for industrial
development.
A bid package was issued by the DBRA staff inviting experienced and qualified contractors to submit bid
proposals to perform certain environmental due diligence activities at the Junction McGraw Site. After
reviewing the bids and determining a final scope of work for the Junction McGraw Site, DBRA staff selected
Soil and Materials Engineers, Inc. d/b/a SME (the “Contractor”) as the lowest, most responsive bidder.
The Contractor will be performing the following services at the Junction McGraw Site: Phase I report, Phase
II – soil investigation and report, stockpile soil testing and report, environmental soil testing (REC’s) and
report, geotechnical soil testing and report, geotechnical soil testing (test pitting) and report. The Contractor
has proposed a not-to-exceed contract amount of One Hundred Fourteen Thousand Sixty-Five and 80/100
($114,065.80) Dollars for the performance of the services referenced herein.
DBRA staff is requesting the DBRA Board of Directors to authorize the execution of an agreement with the
Contractor to provide the requested services as expressed herein for the not to exceed amount of One
Hundred Fourteen Thousand Sixty-Five and 80/100 ($114,065.80) Dollars.
DBRA staff is also recommending that a contingency representing fifteen (15%) percent of the contract
value, or Seventeen Thousand One Hundred Nine and 87/100 ($17,109.87) Dollars be established to be
disbursed upon the authorization of any two Officers, or any one of the Officers and any of the Authorized
Agents of the DBRA, or any two Authorized Agents of the DBRA.
A resolution approving and authorizing the DBRA to enter into a contract with the Contractor for the above
described services and the establishment of a contingency fund was attached for the DBRA Board’s
consideration.
Mr. George asked what the two larger parcels to the left portion of the site used to be. Ms. Bridges stated
that the two parcels were the former Kronk Gym and Atkinson Park.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the Contractor is Detroit-based and what the ownership of the Contractor is. Mr.
Dailey stated that SME is Detroit-based and is woman-owned.
Ms. DeSantis stated that at the Detroit Building Authority they are provided more information regarding the
firms that respond to the RFPs and that more information should be provided to the DBRA regarding the
firms that respond to the RFPs to ensure that minority-owned, Detroit-based, and Women-owned firms are
selected as much as possible.
Ms. DeSantis asked what criteria is used to select a firm for a contract through an RFP. Mr. Dailey stated
that the lowest bidder that is also the most responsive is generally the firm that is selected.
Ms. DeSantis asked if there is written criteria or a policy used to select firms in the RFP process. Ms.
Kanalos stated that the DBRA does not have a written policy on how to select a firm through the RFP

 process. Ms. DeSantis requested that a written policy be created for the DBRA for how to select a firm
through the RFP process.
Ms. DeSantis asked who at the DBRA selects the firm out of the RFP process and stated that at the Detroit
Building Authority the decision is made through a committee. Mr. Walters asked who made the decision on
which firm to select for the DBRA. Mr. Dailey stated that the decision was made based on the amount of
the bids and responsiveness and experience of the firms.
Mr. Scott added that the Building Safety Engineering and Environmental Department of the City of Detroit
is sometimes involved in the RFP process for contracts that involve work on City-owned land because the
Department’s role is to protect the interest of the City of Detroit.
Ms. Wilkins suggested that if the DBRA is selecting a firm, then a member of the Board should be involved
in the decision-making process when selecting a firm through an RFP.
Ms. DeSantis stated that she would like to see a written policy for the DBRA procurement process and then
delegate the decision-making to the DBRA staff, or a DBRA member should be involved in the decisionmaking process if there is not a written policy for the DBRA procurement process.
Ms. McClain asked for clarification on what actions the DBRA Board member would take during the
decision-making process should a DBRA Board member be involved in the RFP process. Ms. Wilkins stated
that she would like to see if there is a model for the procurement process for other public authorities that
can be used as reference.
Ms. Bridges stated that the DBRA staff will begin to work through a written procurement process with
guidelines that can be presented to the DBRA Board for review at a future meeting, and that more
information on the firms that respond to an RFP can be provided.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Land Assembly Project: Engagement of Environmental Firm,
as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Wilkins, seconded by Mr. George, DBRA Resolution Code 19-10-262-30 was

Project Introduction
K8 Partners LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails the rehabilitation of
the existing building into eight residential townhome apartments units. Each unit will include modern
floorplans and finishes with private entry and exit, including covered porches which face the streets and
rear porches that access private parking.
The total investment is estimated to be $2.46 million. The Developer is requesting $276,897.00 in TIF
reimbursement.
There will be 73 temporary construction jobs and 1 FTE jobs. The 1 FTE job will be related to property
management.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of one (1) parcels located in Detroit’s Islandview

functionally obsolete as defined by Act 381.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs

as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include demolition and lead and asbestos abatement,
infrastructure improvements, site preparation, and development and preparation of brownfield plan and Act
381 work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the
Property and will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of
eligible activities and will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to commence within 18 months
of approval of the Plan and be completed within 3 years.

 Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue generated
by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible activities

Attached for the DBRA Board’s review and approval was a resolution authorizing the 2119 Field Street
Brownfield Plan for submittal to the Community Advisory Committee for consideration and comment within
30 days of their receipt of the proposed Plan. In addition, it authorizes the President of the Detroit Economic
Growth Corporation or any person designated by him, as a representative of the DBRA, to conduct a public
hearing in the area to which the Proposed Plan applies within the next 30 days. This public hearing may be
held jointly with any public hearing conducted by the Community Advisory Committee.
Mr. Schloff provided more information about the project including the background and experience of the
development team in New York and Detroit, the proposed number of units for the project, the plans for
parking behind the building for future tenants, the history of the Property, the financial challenges of the
project, the amount of owner equity for the project (55%), the levels of affordability of the units (20%
available at 80% of the Area Median Income), the plans to hire Detroit residents for the construction of the
project, the property management for the project will be conducted by Villages Property Management, the
contact with Mac Farr, the Executive Director of the Villages CDC and residents in the area.
Ms. DeSantis asked what some comments received from the community were and if the Developer has
contacted GenesisHOPE regarding the project. Mr. Schloff stated that generally the community was
pleased to see plans for the building to be renovated and there were some concerns regarding the
affordability of the project.
Ms. DeSantis stated that there is a gentrification problem in the Islandview neighborhood.
Mr. Walters asked if there are plans to paint the brick façade. Mr. Schloff stated that there are plans to paint
the red brick façade of the building due to the unavailability of the brick used to construct the building, and

 that the brick has been patched with other color brick and the reason for painting is to make the façade
consistent.
Ms. Wilkins asked if the units will be for sale or rent and what the rental rates will be. Mr. Schloff stated that
the units will be available for rent and that the anticipated rental rates will be about $1.25 per square foot
for the market rate units and about $1.00 per square foot for the affordable units.
Mr. Gonzalez asked if this is the Developer’s first project in this neighborhood. Mr. Schloff stated that the
Developer has done some renovations of single-family and duplex homes in the Islandview neighborhood.
Mr. George asked about the timeline for the completion of the project. Ms. Capler stated that according to
the Plan, the eligible activities will begin within eighteen months. Mr. Walters stated that the Developer can
start construction after all incentive approvals are obtained for the project. Mr. Vosburg stated that the
DBRA staff does support a lookback for this project of up to 8 months, as DBRA Guidelines allow, for eligible
activities conducted before approval of the Plan due to a packed City Council agenda that does not have
room for approval of this project before recess the week of Thanksgiving.
Mr. Walters called for a motion authorize a public hearing on the 2119 Field Street Brownfield
Redevelopment Plan and its submittal to the Community Advisory Committee, as presented. The Board
