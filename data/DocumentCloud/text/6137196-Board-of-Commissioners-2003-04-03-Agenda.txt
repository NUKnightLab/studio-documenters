Re:

Request for Contract Renewal and Amendment
Curb lane cleaning services for five (5) maintenance areas
Elgin Sweeping Services, Inc.
Section: 02-IFCLS-03-GM
Fiscal Impact: $263,020.64

The Bureau of Maintenance of the Highway Department has an existing contract with Elgin Sweeping
Services, Inc. to provide curb lane cleaning services for five (5) maintenance areas. This service contract
was awarded by the County Board on May 7, 2002 for a period of twelve (12) months from May 7, 2002
to May 6, 2003. A condition of the current contract allows for a one year renewal at the same terms with
mutual written agreement between the parties. Elgin Sweeping Services, Inc. wishes to renew the
existing contract with the Highway Department under the same terms and conditions for an additional
year.
The amendment results from a change of work to be performed. Additional work will be required for the
springtime Initial Arterial cleaning cycle for 56.40 curb lane miles in District #3 which was not part of the
original contract. The original contract called for a fall Full Arterial cleaning cycle only. The unit price
for cleaning the curb lane for District #3 will be the same as Districts #1, 2, 4 and 5 which is $332.91 per
curb lane mile which was required in the original contract. The additional cost for 56.40 curb lane miles
will be $18,776.13 for District #3. This additional amount will change the original contract price from
$244,244.51 to $263,020.64.
I, therefore, respectfully recommend to your Honorable Body that authorization for a twelve (12) month
renewal be approved from May 7, 2003 to May 6, 2004 in the amount of $263,020.64.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the request of the Superintendent
of Highways be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

WHEREAS, there has been considerable court litigation, reports, publications and public
demonstrations about alleged excessive use of force and abuse by law enforcement officials
and gang activities within Cook County Jail System; and
WHEREAS, to maintain integrity of the Cook County Jail System it is necessary that an
investigation be conducted by an independent body which has no past or present ties with the
criminal justice system in Cook County: such as universities and law schools which are more
cost effective, labor intensive, and could shorten the completion time of the investigation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County authorize the commission of an independent investigation of
Cook County Jail System by a university or law school through the RFP process; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the RFP process clearly defines the scope of services
to be rendered which shall include but are not limited to protecting the confidentiality of all
interviewees, a clearly defined plan to minimize disruptions of day-to-day operations, and a
time certain for completion.

representing Hinshaw & Culbertson, and stated that legal counsel had advised him that he should not
engage in detailed discussion of any alleged incidents.
Sheriff Sheahan read a prepared statement, the text and appendices of which are submitted herewith and
made a part hereof. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley called upon Secretary Williams to read into the record a letter from President Stroger to
the Honorable Paul P. Biebel, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division, which is submitted herewith and
made a part hereof. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
At the request of President Stroger, Secretary Williams read pertinent sections of the County Jail Act (730
ILCS 125/22, 125/23) into the record, all of which are submitted hereto and made a part herewith. (The
referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
President Stroger expressed his appreciation to Sheriff Sheahan for appearing before the committee to
submit a comprehensive report regarding what his office 's response is to alleged jail brutality. He further
stated that the State' s Attorney' s Office must be allowed to do its part, as must the Chief Judge by statute
and constitutional authority. President Stroger called upon the Board of Commissioners to support the
Sheriff s efforts to address the issues of overpopulation and under-funding of correctional institutions.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

Commissioner Collins noted her support for a Grand Jury convened by Chief Judge Timothy Evans,
because it would be made up of citizens and would therefore be independent. She expressed her desire
for an ongoing review of alleged brutality.
Sheriff Sheahan said that he welcomes input from independent bodies. He offered the example of
KPMG, the consulting firm conducting a review of the Cook County Jail, using an outside panel of law
enforcement professionals. He stated that the current average stay of an inmate is 180 days, up from 90
days. There are almost 1,000 people who have been in jail over 2 years.
In response to Commissioner Collins' question regarding whether the Sheriff is reviewing all issues or
only brutality, Sheriff Sheahan stated that the consulting firm is looking at all relevant operational issues,
specifically within the Internal Affairs Division and with respect to inmate grievances.
Chairman Daley stated the letter from President Stroger was directed to Judge Biebel in his role as
Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division, not to Chief Judge Timothy Evans.
President Stroger confirmed that the presiding judge of the criminal division would oversee this matter.
He further noted that he does not intend to select any additional members for the Sheriffs investigative
review panel at this time.
Commissioner Quigley expressed his belief that the Sheriff s Office shou ld make the panel independent,
as did Los Angeles.
Sheriff Sheahan responded that his panel is independent, and that he has no objection to the idea of a
grand jury.
Commissioner Quigley suggested that if the Sheriff goes the extra step of having an independent
committee investigate the allegations, public faith in the system would be restored.
Jn response to Commissioner Quigley' s question about whether the panel will be reviewing the whole
Sheriffs system or just the jail, Sheriff Sheahan responded just the jail.
In response to Commissioner Quigley' s question about what triggers an inquiry by Internal Affairs,
Sheriff Sheahan responded that any report made by an inmate triggers a review by Internal Affairs, and if
the complaint is deemed significant, Internal Affairs investigates further, and, depending on the severity
of the charge, there is also a group of Sheriffs police ready to investigate. The Internal Affairs Division
is headed by the inspector general, who reviews all cases handled by the department. He further stated
that there are mandatory reports that all officers who use force must submit, and checks and balances are
in place now that did not exist five years ago.
Commissioner Quigley stated that in the Litigation Subcommittee over the past five years, it appeared to
the members of the committee that only about half of the complaints were being investigated by Internal
Affairs.
Sheriff Sheahan said that may have been the case previously, but was not the case presently. He also
stated that the Sheriffs Office has a sophisticated detective team that seeks to uncover criminal activity,
and cited a recent example wherein a guard who struck a suspect in a well known murder case in Palatine
was te1minated and is being charged by the State's Attorney' s Office.

1067

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

In response to Commissioner Quigley's suggestion that it might be prudent for the Sheriffs Office to go
back over cases which settled and where the officers involved were not disciplined, Sheriff Sheahan
responded that the Sheriffs Office is tracking all prior allegations of use of force, whether the allegation
was sustained or not.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question whether the Sheriffs Office is going to review these
cases, Sheriff Sheahan responded that the consulting firm is going to devise policies based on these cases,
but that these cases will not be reopened.
Commissioner Quigley noted that the Litigation Subcommittee would appreciate receiving these reports
on an ongoing basis.
Sheriff Sheahan stated that since 1998 he has moved to fire 176 employees, for failing drug tests,
excessive force, job abandonment, domestic violence and other charges, and that in general he is
proactive when it comes to firing employees who violate the law.
Commissioner Silvestri noted that at the most recent subcommittee meeting the State' s Attorney's Office
agreed to provide the employment status of any employee involved in litigation.
Commissioner Quigley asked how the Sheriffs Office intends to utilize alternative programs to alleviate
the overcrowding in Cook County Jail.
Sheriff Sheahan stated that the Jail has 11 ,000 inmates, and an additional 5,500-6,000 on alternative
programs. Inmates are classified according to the crimes they commit. A recent study showed that
detainees on electronic monitoring are more likely to show up to court than those out on bond. This
program, along with progressive discipline, is very successful. He stated that other alternatives are Day
Reporting, Boot Camp and drug treatment. He further stated that just when the overpopulation problem
was being brought to heel, the state transferred 1,257 parole holds to the jail, and that the Sheriff's Office
is not allowed to put these parole holds in alternative programs.
Commissioner Quigley noted that in a report from approximately five years ago, it was indicated that
there were, at the time, approximately 6,000 people being held on $1,000 bond, in addition to people who
were homeless or didn ' t have a telephone, and therefore could not be put on electronic monitoring.
Sheriff Sheahan disputed this figure, explaining that there are 1,600 murder detainees, another 2,400 <}re
rapists or have committed anned robbery or aggravated battery. Sheriff Sheahan stated that he believes
that more people can be put in alternative programs, but that it would require a financial commitment
from the Board of Commissioners, because the programs are at their budgetary limits.
Commissioner Quigley offered the opinion that perhaps the criteria used to funnel people into alternative
programs is a little rigid. He questioned the lack of alternative, community-based housing, and said that
poor people with no phone are not allowed to be released into programs that require monitoring.
Sheriff Sheahan replied that there is currently a pilot program underway where those without a phone are
given a wireless phone. He commented that he would put out as many people as he could as long as they
could be monitored and were not a threat to society. He reiterated that the overcrowding problem is due
to an unanticipated 1,200 detainees who cannot be bonded out and are not going through the system in a
timely manner.
Chairman Daley asked Commissioner Quigley to identify the report to which he was referring.

1068

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

Commissioner Quigley replied that the report is a 2001 draft that was part of CORT (County Operational
Report Team) Report that the President had commissioned. He further stated that the numbers of
detainees at the Jail don't seem to add up.
Sheriff Sheahan responded that the real problem is those who are property of the state and cannot get a
parole hold meeting.
In response to President Stroger' s question whether the legislature has addressed the issue of detainees
committing crimes while out on parole, Sheriff Sheahan responded that within its first year the
community was protesting the use of the I bond because a number of those out on bond were committing
crimes.
Commissioner Quigley stated that it would be wise to do a system-wide, rather than jail-wide, study, that
many of the ideas that Sheriff Sheahan had talked about were in the 1992 Kolts study from Los Angeles
County, including the early warning system, the responsive grievance process, the aggressive internal
investigations, and using litigation to learn from mistakes as a management tool.
Sheriff Sheahan stated that he had been to the Los Angeles jail and that he believes Cook County's jail is
managed better.
Commissioner Goslin asked that Sheriff Sheahan get back to the Commissioners regarding how many
detainees are held on bond of $1 ,000 or Jess, because from a cost/benefit analysis it might be better to
create an alternative program for them, especially if the numbers Commissioner Quigley quotes are
accurate.
Sheriff Sheahan responded that yes he would do this, but advised that some of the detainees have a
history of crime and it is not prudent for them to be out on bond. He stated that, as a former teacher, he
believes that people will better themselves given a chance and this is why so many alternative programs
have been developed.
Vice-Chairman Steele said that she hopes the panel will be expanded by at least two or three people. She
asked what time frame the Sheriff had for the panel to produce a report.
Sheriff Sheahan said that those parameters would be set in a meeting tomorrow, and this information
would be conveyed to the commissioners.
In response to Vice Chairman Steele's request for a specific explanation of the grievance process, Sheriff
Sheahan referred the com.missioners to Exhibit E of his report which contains a detailed explanation.
In response to Vice Chainnan Steele's request for an explanation of parole holds, Sheriff Sheahan
responded that these are people who have violated their parole by committing another crime, but cannot
be transferred downstate because of pending hearings in Cook County. They get put into the system here
and the system moves slowly and they are not allowed to go into any alternative programs. He stated that
what his office would like to see, if it is a minor charge, is to have a bearing quickly in a parole court. He
stated that the state will not contribute any money for more judges.
President Stroger commented that it is necessary for the state to take some responsibility.

1069

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

Sheriff Sheahan stated that active parolees have unduly burdened the system. He stated that under the
direction of President Stroger and Bill Quinlan, he has had repeated meetings with all the principals,
including the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC), to no avail. He stated that he even suggested
that parolees be sent to Joliet, but instead the State shut down Joliet.
Jn response to Vice Chairman Steele's observation that 10% of the jail population is mentally ill, Sheriff
Sheahan noted that the State has closed many of its mental institutions. He stated that a number of
inmates are treated with medication by jail doctors.
President Stroger noted that the State has abdicated its responsibility to the homeless, especially the
mentally ill, who only get treatment while in jail. He noted that the Board of Commissioners must work
with legislators to spur legislative action.
In response to Commissioner Sims' question regarding whether the Sheriff has pursued any grants, or
considered purchasing the building across the street from the jail to house the mentally ill, Sheriff
Sheahan stated that Cermak Hospital does an analysis of each incoming inmate for mental illness, and his
office has worked with the Illinois Department of Mental Health trying to get grants for mentally ill
female inmates. He noted that the County tried to purchase the building across the street but that it was
overvalued and therefore not a good investment.
In response to Vice Chairman Steele' s question about what the Special Operations Response Teams
(SORT) does, Sheriff Sheahan explained that every major penal institution has Special Operations
Response Teams, and that these teams engage in a number of activities, including taking a prisoner to
court or downstate, responding to fights, and conducting contraband searches. He stated that most of the
SORT teams operate in maximum-security divisions. He also stated that there are cameras now for
contraband searches and sweeps. He further stated that cameras were implemented earlier with officers
conducting traffic stops and that he expected resistance to these early cameras but that there was none.
With these officers an order was developed, and this order will be followed in the jails. He stated that
cameras afford the ability to review what took place and mete out appropriate discipline, including firing
and criminal prosecution.
In response to Commissioner Murphy's question regarding how the drug/alcohol offenders and t hose with
minor violations get mixed into the general population, Sheriff Sheahan replied that the general
population is segregated from the most violent inmates, and includes minimum and medium security. He
further clarified that maximum security takes up about 40% of the jail.

Commissioner Maldonado commented that he approves of the videotaping. He also commented that the
SORT team s are held suspect by the public. He asked who would be doing the videotaping.
Sheriff Sheahan stated that right now a SORT member would be doing the videotaping, but that in the
future, specially trained personnel would do it. He commented that in the police videotaping, the tape is
immediately put into a locked box, and only a sergeant can take it out. He stated that also, at the
Markham Courthouse, there is a video camera taping the lockup. He stated that he' d like to have
stationary videotaping in all of the courthouses and in the jail.
Commi ssioner Maldonado asked what safeguards the Sheriff is going to put into place to prevent the
SORT team member who is handling the video camera from turning it off once altercations ensue. He
further stated that the public needs to know that there will be safeguards.

1070

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

Sheriff Sheahan replied that an inmate could also hit the corrections officer holding the camera. He stated
that this is why he would like a camera on the wall. He further stated that there will be timers on the
video cameras.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado' s question about how a SORT team gets its orders, Sheriff
Sheahan stated that, under the supervision of commanding officers, SORT teams deal mainly with the
security of the jail or the security of inmates.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado 's question about who can stop an investigation in Internal
Affairs, Sheriff Sheahan replied that only the Inspector General can stop an investigation in Internal
Affairs.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question about whether it is typical for an investigation to last
over two to three years, Sheriff Sheahan replied that yes, if a case involves litigation, it could be put on
hold for several years.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question about whether a case investigated by Internal Affairs
has its findings reviewed by the Inspector General, Sheriff Sheahan replied that yes, the Inspector General
reviews the findings and recommends disciplinary action, and then the findings go back to the jail to the
Command Channel Review, first to the Executive Director and then to the Undersheriff.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question about whether it was the practice that a request for
medical attention should always be responded to, Sheriff Sheahan responded that it depended on the
circumstances, but that yes, this was the generally the case.
Commissioner Maldonado commented that he had heard of an entity in other jurisdictions called critical
incident review team that reviews critical incidents to make sure that the incident conforms to the proper
policies and procedures.
Sheriff Sheahan replied that while there is no formal acronym, he meets with the executive director and
superintendents of the jail to discuss any unusual circumstances. He further stated that good supervision
is critical.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that he and the Sheriff had previously discussed the possible
appointment of a person of Latino descent to the new panel.
Commissioner Peraica noted that over the past ninety days the Board has approved over $500,000 in
consulting contracts for lobbyists in Springfield. He stated that he hopes that the Sheriffs Office takes
the opportunity to work with some of these lobbyists to procure funding and legislative initiatives from
Springfield. He further stated that it has been asserted that there is racism at the jail, and asked for a
breakdown of the racial makeup of the correctional officers.
Sheriff Sheahan replied that the racial makeup of the staff is mostly African American, then white, then
Hispanic. He noted that the staff is dedicated and the job is tough. He also stated that the Jail has
partnered with Moraine Valley Community College to support the staff earning college credit. He further
stated that the American Correctional Association (ACA) has consistently rated Cook County as the
highest among the major jails. He reiterated, the major problems confronting the jail are overcrowding,
and that cases move too slow through the system. Additional problems include turf wars between gang
members and inmates testifying against each other.

1071

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

In response to Commissioner Peraica' s question about whether the jail has a representative on the Judicial
Advisory Council, Sheriff Sheahan replied yes.
In response to Commissioner Peraica's question about what legislative initiatives the Cook County Board
of Commissioners should support, Sheriff Sheahan replied that the biggest issue confronting the jail is
getting parole holds to a speedier resolve. He stated another initiative would be a limitation on how long
it takes for someone to get a trial. He stated that a third initiative would be for the state to give the jail
more funding.
Commissioner Silvestri commented that the state government is in deep financial debt and that the Cook
County Board of Commissioners and the Cook County jail should not rely on it for funding. He then
asked whether there has been any effort, since the Budget Hearings, to come up with a way to work with
the judiciary so that, for example, existing judges could be reassigned to the parole system.
Sheriff Sheahan stated that a request was made from the State for more judges, but that the State did not
have the funds.
Commissioner Butler commented on reports that one detainee in particular was currently located in an
area where an alleged incident was said to occur, and he wondered if it might be prudent to relocate this
detainee.
Sheriff Sheahan replied that he would take Commissioner Butler's comment under advisement.
In response to Commissioner Suffredin' s question about whether suspected criminal activities are referred
to the State' s Attorney's Office, Sheriff Sheahan replied yes.
In response to Commissioner Suffredin ' s question about whether the Merit Board plays any role in the
reports of the Internal Affairs Division, Sheriff Sheahan replied that the Merit Board reviews firings. He
stated that in cases of less than 30 days discipline, the case remains internal.
Commissioner Suffredin asked how the Sheriff is apprised of these happenings, and whether the Sheriff
receives reports from the Inspector General or the Internal Affairs Division.
Sheriff Sheahan explained that the case routing is as follows: the case goes to the Inspector General, who
makes a recommendation for discipline, then the case goes to the department from which it came, then it
goes to Command Channel Review, then to the Undersheriff who concurs with or modifies the
recommendation.
In response to Commissioner Suffredin 's inquiry about the 1999 and 2000 cases, Sheriff Sheahan
responded that they were handled by Internal Affairs.
Commissioner Suffredin encouraged a speedy resolution of these cases because they could hold up the
reappointments to the Merit Board, and this would be unfortunate. Commissioner Suffredin concluded by
stating that he believes the committee should continue to work on the resolution offered by Commissioner
Collins.
In response to Commissioner Hansen 's question about whether the State's Attorney' s Office has
considered filing a suit against the State of Illinois because parole holds are wards of the state and
therefore the state should be held accountable, Patrick Driscoll replied no such suit is planned but that he
would be willing to discuss it.

1072

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

Sheriff Sheahan noted that his figures currently show 1,257 parole holds at the jail, and this figure causes
severe budgetary pressures.
In response to Commissioner Gorman ' s question about whether the understaffing at the jail is a budgetary
issue or a result of the hiring criteria, Sheriff Sheahan replied it is primarily a budgetary issue, but also a
result of the early retirement program.
In response to an inquiry from Commissioner Sims, Tom Lyons of the State's Attorney's Office made the
distinction between several categories of parole holds, including one category comprised of new arrests
that are pending trial.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

COMMUNICATION FROM COMMISSIONER MIKE QUIGLEY.
Transmitting a
Communication from Mike Quigley, County Commissioner, dated February 2003:
Re: Litigation involving the Sheriff
The following is a synopsis of the Communication from Commissioner Mike Quigley.
Over the course of the past few years, members of the Litigation Subcommittee of the Cook
County Board Finance Committee have grown increasingly frustrated by ongoing payouts to
victims of brutality and excessive force at the hands of Cook County Sheriffs Deputies.
While a certain measure of litigation is always inevitable, some of the outrageous fact
patterns in the suits against the Sheriff's Department add to the Commissioners' sense that
oversight and accountability at the Sheriff's Department is lacking.

* Referred to the Finance Committee on March 6, 2003.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to defer consideration of
Communication No. 258067. The motion carried.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Health and Hospitals of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Wednesday, March 26, 2003 at the hour of 11 :00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
258278

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES by Ruth M. Rothstein, Chief, transmitting a
Communication, dated March 13, 2003:
requesting authorization in accordance with Section 30 of the 2003 Cook County Budget
Resolution to apply for a grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration
(HRSA) in the initial amount of $650,000.00 under the joint application process for the
Community Health Centers and Public Housing Primary Care programs. The application will
be made on behalf of four health centers in the Ambulatory and Community Health Network
of Cook County - Cottage Grove Health Center (Ford Heights), Englewood Health Center,
Robbins Health Center and Woody Winston Health Center (Phoenix) and will provide
funding for primary and preventive health care services in medically-underserved areas. The
grant will fund 11.5 full time equivalent personnel.

In order to comply with HRSA regulations, the grant application will be made in conjunction
with a Co-Applicant Board, a majority of whose members are patients of the four health
centers. The responsibilities of the Co-Application Board will be set forth in an agreement
between the Bureau and the Co-Applicant Board.

1126

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003
The Bureau is contemplating including additional health centers in future applications under
these programs, which could lead to additional grants in future years in the amount of
$650,000.00 annually.
Qualification of the Ford Heights, Phoenix and Robbins health centers under these programs
will make pharmaceuticals purchased for those centers eligible for discounted pricing under
the Section 340B drug-pricing program. The Bureau estimates this could save $1.5 million
annually.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award : $650,000.00. Funding period: October I,
2003 through September 30, 2004.
*Referred to the Health and Hospitals Committee on 3/18/03.

Chairman Butler opened the meeting by asking Bureau Chief Ruth Rothstein for remarks.
Ruth Rothstein, Chief of the Bureau of Health Services, gave an overview regarding the proposed
community health center grant application from the United States Health Resources and Services
Administration in an initial amount of $650,000.00. Ms. Rothstein indicated that before the County can
file the final application, the County Board must approve the request. Ms. Rothstein stated that she would
like to make a presentation on what the grant is, what it will do for the county and where it will take the
county into the future.
Dr. Terrence Conway, Chief Operating Officer, Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook
County, stated that the grant would help fund the delivery of comprehensive primary health care services
in communities. Dr. Conway commented that the grant will allow the Bureau of Health Services to
expand services, and enable the Bureau to bill Medicare and Medicaid for the patients.
Dr. Conway further stated that the Bureau of Health Services is proposing to add four more centers under
the initial application for this year. He said the Bureau will have the ability to bring on additional centers
in subsequent years, but only one application per year can be filed. He stated that this process allows the
Bureau of Health Services access to other funding sources.
Commissioner Steele asked if the grant is for one year and is it renewable?
Dr. Conway stated that the grant is renewable, and the initial application is for three years and it can be
renewed at the end of three years.
Commissioner Daley asked Dr. Conway what he meant by stating that the services would be expanded?
Dr. Terrence Conway stated that basic clinic services would be expanded.
Commissioner Daley asked how will the discounted prices on phannaceuticals correlate to the McKesson
contract?
Dr. Conway replied that the grant allows the Bureau of Health Services to receive more advantageous
prices for patients at the centers. He said some centers receive advantageous prices for other reasons, but
this would assure that the centers included in the initial applications, would receive the best purchase
price in the country.

1127

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003
Ruth Rothstein stated that the Bureau of Health Services anticipates annual savings of about $1.5 million
from pharmaceuticals.
Commissioner Murphy asked if the Bureau of Health Services plans to include another center next year?
Dr. Conway stated that next year the Bureau of Health Services would be able to apply for another
$650,000.00.
Commissioner Sims asked if Dr. Conway would elaborate on what the $650,000.00 will provide?
Dr. Terrence Conway stated that he would refer the Commissioner's question to Robert Kohl.
Robert Kohl, Director of Ambulatory Development for the Ambulatory and Community Health Network
of Cook County, stated that the additional services would be mental health and substance abuse. There
will be social workers that will make sure that patients who now receive medical services will have an
entree into the mental health and substance abuse area.
Commissioner Sims asked what is the Bureau of Health Services going to do with mental health since the
Bureau does not have any facilities for inpatient services?
Robert Kohl replied that the goal is to assess the patients at the four centers. Also, the Bureau of Health
Services has agreements with other providers for mental health and substance abuse and the patients
would be referred to those systems where the Bureau has agreements.
Commissioner Sims asked what kind of services would the Bureau provide for substance abuse?
Robert Kohl said referrals for substance abuse would be made to agencies where the Bureau of Health
Services has agreements.
Commissioner Sims asked if the Bureau sees itself becoming a methadone service provider for these
communities or is this only for referrals?
Robert Kohl stated that it is for referrals, only.
Commissioner Sims asked what is the $650,000.00 to be used for?
Robert Kohl stated that the Bureau of Health Services does not have any supplies and ninety percent of
the expenses in the grant are to pay for staff. He stated that approximately three psychiatric social
workers need to be hired to expand the capability in the mental health and substance abuse area.
Mr. Kohl stated that the Bureau of Health Services looks at this in a life cycle approach beginning with
infants to seniors. He said on the infant side, staff works with immunization levels, for children you are
looking at asthma, dental health and working with the Department of Public Health. In regards to adults
and seniors, the Bureau is looking at chronic diseases, such as hypertension, cancer detection and
prevention, asthma, diabetes and adult immunizations. In order to be able to accomplish all of this, the
Bureau needs more nurses, someone to answer the telephones and finally an administrative person to keep
everyone and everything in order.
Commissioner Sims asked if there are any dollars included for MIS?
Robert Kohl responded no.

1128

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

Commissioner Suffredin commented that this is a great program and a grant that the Bureau of Health
Services must participate in and hopes that in the future the Bureau will be able to find some north side
locations especially in the Rogers Park area. Further, he stated that the a co-applicant is needed because
of certain Federal regulations that hopefully the Bureau will be able to work with in the future to ease
access to funding. He also stated that the Board needs to understand that there are certain Federal
regulations that put obstacles in the way of getting at some of these programs. In conclusion, he
commended the Bureau of Health Services for getting through some of the regulations and applying for
the grant.
Commissioner Suffredin stated the drug-pricing program in Section 340B is before Congress and is being
changed.
Commissioner Hansen asked a question regarding the lowest prices on the market, and asked would that
apply to any reduction in the County's contract for specific pharmaceuticals under McKesson?
Dr. Terrence Conway replied that it would allow savings of some drugs purchased through McKesson for
the health centers.
Commissioner Hansen asked how many pharmaceuticals are on the list?
Dr. Conway stated there are thousands of pharmaceuticals on the list, and said he is not sure of the exact
number.
Commissioner Hansen commented that it would be of interest to know how many of the thousands of
pharmaceutics the Bureau of Health Services purchases will be affected in terms of pricing by the
contract.
Ruth Rothstein responded that she did not have an answer but the Bureau would look into it.
Commissioner Hansen asked what type of patient would qualify for the program?
Dr. Conway said that the health center qualifies, based on two criteria: one, the center needs to have a set
of comprehensive services; and two, the center has to have medically underserved patients.
Commissioner Hansen asked Dr. Conway to define the term "medically underserved" .
Dr. Terrence Conway responded that he would provide the definition for the commissioner.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the Bureau of Health Services would be hiring additional personnel?
Dr. Conway stated that the Bureau would be hiring people supported by the grant.
Commissioner Hansen asked where would the Executive Director be located?
Dr. Conway replied that there would be one Executive Director who would manage programs at the four
health centers.
Commissioner Hansen asked why the Bureau needs an Executive Director for the grant.
Dr. Conway responded that the grant specifies that an Executive Director administer the grant.
Ruth Rothstein asked David Carvalho to respond to Commissioner Hansen 's question .

1129

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003
David Carvalho, Special Counsel for the Bureau of Health Services, stated that there are many regulations
that the Bureau must follow to qualify for the grant. He said this is the reason why the Bureau of Health
Services did not previously apply for the grant. Now regulations have evolved and the Federal
government has been intent on putting more money into the program. One aspect of the regulations is
that there be a co-applicant board that is an advisory board that submits the application with the Bureau,
and requires an Executive Director. He concluded that the advisory board has input into the selection of
the Executive Director.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the Executive Director is full or part-time?
David Carvalho stated that the Executive Director would be full-time. The Executive Director could have
responsibilities that extend beyond the grant, but it is a requirement of the grant that there be someone
identified and supported by the grant as the Executive Director and have that relationship with the coapplicant board.
David Carvalho stated that the majority of the $650,000.00 grant is for personnel.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if there is a difference between the ambulatory clinics and the
Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County?
David Carvalho responded that they are the same and are comprised of the thirty clinics throughout the
county.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if the purpose of the new board is so that the Bureau of Health Services
would be able to apply for the grant?
David Carvalho stated that as part of becoming eligible for the grant process the Federal government
established certain regulations that public entities such as Cook County or for that matter the City of
Chicago could go through to become eligible. The program initially was designed for free-standing
clinics that are not attached to another facility. When the program was modified to allow entities that
were owned by someone else, a measure of community input that paralleled that of a free-standing
independent clinic was added. To qualify for this grant program the free-standing clinics would have to
have a board of directors comprised of a majority of patients in the clinic and meet some other
demographic requirements.
Mr. Carvalho further stated that a public body such as the City of Chicago or Cook County could not have
a requirement that the board be comprised of a majority of patients because that would require the
commissioners to be patients in the clinic. That would require the commissioners to reflect certain
demographic categories as the owners of the clinics, which is impossible. So they established an
alternative path, which was to create a co-applicant board. It is called co-applicant because they submit
the application with the Bureau of Health Services, and it is called a Board because it is an advisory
board.
Mr. Carvalho stated that the regulations indicate what the roles and responsibilities of the co-applicant
board are and the requirement that the co-applicant board meets those demographic tests, and that the coapplicant board is fifty-one percent patients and the co-applicant board reflects the community served.
When the Bureau put together the initial application they strategized with people who had successful
applications in the past and identified a mix of clinics that would then be directed by a co-applicant board.
The co-applicant board would be representative of the four clinics meeting Federal requirements. Mr.
Carvalho further stated that if the Bureau of Health Services would like to add another clinic and apply
for another $650,000.00 grant, the Bureau would also have to change the composition of the Board so that
it would reflect the larger pool of clinics.

I 130

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

Commissioner Maldonado asked how the clinics were selected?
David Carvalho stated that the 340B pricing fo r outpatient drugs is only available to certain clinics or
certain clinics associated with certain hospitals. When the Bureau of Health Services started the process,
three south suburban clinics that are part of the co-application did not qualify for the 340B pricing. The
first goal the Bureau of Health Services wanted to accomplish was to help the 330 clinics qualify for
340B discount drug pricing. The second goal was to achieve geographic diversity and add one more
clinic. He commented that the Bureau will be adding more clinics each year.
Commissioner Maldonado asked what is meant by diversity?
David Carvalho said that eventually the clinic board would have to be representative of the total
complement of clinics under the application. If the clinic board began with only representation from one
geographic area, and as it expanded to cover more clinics, a large number of people would have to be
added to reflect that diversity on the board. He concluded by saying that by starting off with four clinics
that are regionally diverse then the board 's req uirement for regional diversity would be met.
Ruth Rothstein stated that the three clinics that were chosen are located in changing areas, so that both
Hispanic and African American patients are being served.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if there were any numbers available?
Ruth Rothstein stated that she would get the numbers for the commissioner.
Commissioner Daley asked if the grant has been reviewed by the Budget Department?
Grace Colbert responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Murphy asked if all the clinics would eventually be eligible to apply for the grant or do the
clinics need to meet the original criteria?
David Carvalho stated that he is not sure if all the clinics would be eligible, but for the foreseeable future
clinics will be added each year.
Dr. Conway stated that there are clinics that don' t do primary care, and clinics that specialize that do not
qualify for the grant.
Commissio ner Hansen asked if the definition of " unde rserved" is based on economic demographics or on
the number of physicians available or a combination of both? He asked if the Bureau has economic
demographics on the areas served by each clinic?
Robert Kohl replied that some of the crite ria for being designated as an " underserved" area include: a
percent uninsured, ratio of physicians per population, income, and infant mortality.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the Bureau of Health Services has a specific area from which the Bureau
draws census tracks?
Robert Kohl stated that data has been assembled for the four clinics.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the Bureau of Health Services has the data for all the clinics?
Robert Kohl stated that the current data is not complete for all the clinics.
Commissioner Hansen stated that it would be helpful to see all the data for each of the thirty clinics.

11 3 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003

Commissioner Hansen asked if the four clinics selected substantially fall at the lower end of the
demographics that the Bureau is using as being economically underserved.
Robert Kohl stated that the most clinics score on a scale of 100 and Cook County clinics scored over
ninety.
David Carvalho clarified that in the earlier presentation it was pointed out that the grant was for three
years and the original letter indicated the grant period was one year. He stated that when the County
Board takes action on the item on April 3, the motion should state that the grant period is three years.
Chairman Butler stated that the Health and Hospitals Committee meeting would stand in recess until
Thursday, April 3, 2003 at 9:45 a.m.
Chairman Butler called the meeting to order and asked the Secretary to call the roll. Following the roll
call, the chairman asked for a motion to approve the item.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved approval of Communication
No. 256278, as amended. The motion carried.
Commissioner Hansen moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Peraica. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Wednesday, April 2, 2003 at the hour of 1:30 P.M. in the Board Room,
Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
258034

SHERIFF'S MERJT BOARD (REAPPOINTMENT) by Michael F. Sheahan, Sheriff of Cook
County, transmitting a Communication, dated February 4, 2003:
Please be advised that I wish to reappoint Mr. JAMES P. NALLY to serve as a member of
the Cook County Sheriffs Merit Board effective immediately. Mr. Nally's term will expire
on the third Monday in March 2009.
Pursuant to Chapter 55 ILCS Section 5/3-7002, I hereby request the advice and consent of the
Cook County Board of Commissioners relative to the reappointment of Mr. Nally.
I have submitted Mr. Nally's resume for your review.

*Referred to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee on 3/6/03.
Chairman Suffredin called upon James Nally to give a brief background regarding the Sheriff's Merit
Board.
Mr. Nally informed the commissioners that the Sheriff's Merit Board is an independent body created by
Chapter 55 of the Illinois statutes and is a legislative created agency. The main duties of the Board are
two fold: the intake of applications for Correctional Officers and Court Service Deputies. The Board also
is responsible for handling disciplinary hearings for sworn personnel who have merit protection under the
law and have been employed for one year or more. In these cases, the Sheriff has brought a complaint
against the officers and is seeking disciplinary action from a thirty day suspension up to and including
termination.
Mr. Nally commented that the Merit Board conducts testing for applicants; and Illinois State statutes
require applicants to be at least twenty-one years of age, a United States Citizen and hold a high school
diploma or a GED. A written examination is given to the applicants, which is followed by a background
check on all applicants who passed the examination. Further, Mr. Nally stated that each member of the
Merit Board evaluates and certifies candidates whose names are placed on a list from which the Sheriff
selects new hires. The certification is good for two years, and if a candidate is not selected within the
two-year period, they can reapply.
James Nally noted that the Merit Board handles the promotional examinations for positions within the
Cook County Sheriff's Police Department, the Department of Corrections and the Court Services
Department. He stated that the Merit Board conducts the hearings personally. He said there are nine
members on the board and each member handles their own docket and works with a hearing officer to
conduct evidentiary hearings similar to trial type proceedings. At the conclusion of the hearings the
respective Merit Board member then makes a recommendation regarding disciplinary action. The
recommendation is brought before the entire Merit Board so members can review the transcripts and other
evidence in the file, and either approve or not approve the recommended decision of the member who
heard the case. He also noted that a minimum of five members must sign-off on a recommendation for
disposition of a case. Mr. Nally concluded by saying that this year the Merit Board has received over
9,000 applications for entry-level positions, and the Merit Board is currently carrying a docket of about
thirty pending disciplinary cases.

1133

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2003
In response to Commissioner Sims' question regarding the length of time a case can be held before a
ruling is made, Mr. Nally replied that the Illinois statutes provide that once the Sheriff files a complaint,
the Merit Board must attempt to serve the employee within thirty days, and the disciplinary process
proceeds similar to a trial. He noted that the Merit Board attempts to internally resolve cases within a six
to nine month period from the original filing date, but this varies because often times an attorney may
seek additional time.

Commissioner Sims asked if the Merit Board provides training before an employee is certified.
James Nally responded that all training takes place after the applicants are certified.
In response to Commissioner Murphy's question regarding once an applicant appears on the certified list
and if that list becomes obsolete, does the applicant need to be recertified to get on the new list, James
Nally responded that the list is a rolling list and certifications are only good for two years from the date
the applicant is certified.
Commissioner Collins asked if there has ever been an incident where the Merit Board dismissed the
employee after a case has gone to court and been adjudicated in favor of the employee, and the Sheriff
submits the employee' s name to the Merit Board for action?
Mr. Nally replied that once the Merit Board makes the decision the employee has the right to take it to the
Circuit Court and ask that the decision of the Merit Board be overturned.
Commissioner Quigley asked Mr. Nally if the Merit Board has had discussions about changing how the
intake, the out take and investigatory processes work in terms of the Merit Board?
James Nally noted that the intake process begins when a formal written complaint is filed with the Merit
Board.
Commissioner Collins asked if criminal cases are sent to the State's Attorney's Office before going to the
Merit Board?
James Nally responded that he could not answer the commissioner' s question, but stated that if there are
criminal allegations, the case goes directly to the State' s Attorney's Office. Further, he stated that the
State' s Attorney represents the Sheriff before the Merit Board and prosecutes the cases.
In response to Commissioner Quigley' s question regarding whether the Merit Board publishes an annual
report, Mr. Nally indicated that the Merit Board does not generally publish such a report.
Commissioner Quigley also asked to whom the Merit Board reports?
Mr. Nally replied that the Merit Board is an independent statutory body.
Chainnan Suffredin interjected that the appeals taken from Merit Board' s decisions are sent to the Circuit
Court for administrative review.
Chairman Suffredin stated that his office previously distributed the state statute upon which the Sheriffs
Merit Board is based. The chairman also introduced Thomas Dart, the new Chief of Staff for the Sheriffs
Office.
