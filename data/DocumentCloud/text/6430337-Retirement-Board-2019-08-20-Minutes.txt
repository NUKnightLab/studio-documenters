§ 11‐160.1 Group Health Care Plan.  Each employee annuitant in receipt of an annuity on the effective 
date of this Section and each employee who retires on annuity after the effective date of this Section, 
may participate in a group hospital care plan and a group medical and surgical plan approved by the 
Board if the employee annuitant is age 65 or over with at least 15 years of service.  The Board, in 
conformity with its regulations, shall pay to the organization underwriting such plan the current monthly 
premiums up to the maximum amounts authorized in the following paragraph for such coverage. 
  
As of the effective date the Board is authorized to make payments up to $25 per month for employee 
annuitants age 65 years or over with at least 15 years of service. 
  
If the monthly premium for such coverage exceeds the $25 per month maximum authorization, the 
difference between the required monthly premiums for such coverage and such maximum may be 
deducted from the employee annuitant's annuity if the annuitant so elects; otherwise such coverage 
shall terminate. 
  
Amounts contributed by the city as authorized under Section 11‐178 for the benefits set forth in this 
Section shall be credited to the reserve for group hospital care and group medical and surgical plan 
benefits and all such premiums shall be charged to it. 
  
The group hospital care plan and group medical and surgical plan established under this Section are not 
and shall not be construed to be pension or retirement benefits for the purposes of Section 5 of Article 
XIII of the Illinois Constitution of 1970.
