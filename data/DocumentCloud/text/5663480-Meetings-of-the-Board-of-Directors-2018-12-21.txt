 Summary of the Past
Obtaining HIMSSStage 7

PREMIER

"This recognition supports our embrace of health IT and
demonstrates how Cook County Health leverages EMRs to
improve clinical outcomes for an individual patient and also
the health of our community through data,"

John Jay Shannon, MD, CEO of CCHHS

In achieving Stage 7, CCHHS was able to treat an entire population of patients
who otherwise may have gone undetected. In identifying and treating these
patients more effectively, CCHHS was able to improve the health and
satisfaction of their patients with depression, reduce the frequency of return
visits and as a result, save time, money and effort to direct toward improving
other areas of healthcare. HIMSS Analytics Magazine. April 2018

Just over 3 percent of U.S hospitals meet Stage 7

Environmental Scan of Market, Best Practices, Trends
Telehealth takes center stage- more medical connected devices by 2020.
Artificial Intelligence- by 2019, there will be 50 percent increase in the use of robots to deliver
medications and supplies within the hospitals.
Wearables for health and wellness- Fitbits, smart watches, fitness trackers to monitor fitness
e.g. Apple Watch’s heart features including EKG.
Prescriptive analytics- will help determine what should go into the care plan for a specific type of
patient.
Interoperability- with better capabilities to share information across the healthcare spectrum, a
patient’s data follows them wherever they go.
Predictive analytics- encompasses data mining, predictive modelling, and machine learning, that
analyze current and historical facts to make predictions on the likelihood of future outcomes.
