(Item A2)
Since 2005, CHA and Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) have jointly funded
substance abuse and wellness services for CHA residents through Intergovernmental
Agreements. In previous contract years, CDPH has competitively procured a vendor to provide
outreach, assessments, and referrals for admission to drug and alcohol treatment programs. In
2009, CHA and CDPH worked on a plan to realign the services based on the results of an
independent program evaluation and to reflect changes in the service delivery model. In
December 2010, CHA released a Request for Proposal for substance abuse education and
training services. The selected contractor, Caritas, will provide educational workshops for
residents on substance abuse effects and treatment, training for CHA staff and case management
providers and will assist providers with admission into substance abuse treatment services as
needed CDPH will continue to provide partial funding for the services for 22 months in an
amount not to exceed $100,000 in 2011 and $100,000 in 2012 for a total not to exceed $200,000.

March 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012.

(Items A3)
The CHA advertised a Request for Proposal in December 2010 for substance abuse education
and training services. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website, and
on Buy Speed online. In addition to advertising, 30 firms were directly solicited and notified 71
Assist Agencies. The CHA received three proposals and all three vendors were invited for oral
presentations. Based upon the recommendation of the Evaluation Committee and the Best and
Final Offers, it was determined that Caritas’ proposal best met the needs of the CHA and CHA
residents. Caritas has been providing substance abuse assessment and referral services to
Chicago residents for over 35 years. As one of the longest running central intakes in the country,
Caritas provides up to 10,000 physical examinations and psychosocial evaluations every year for

The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid in December 2010 for capital maintenance repairs at
1500-02 S. Christiana (IL2-064), 1415-17 S. Harding (IL2-064) and 1324 N. Cleaver (IL2-131).
The IFB was advertised in area newspapers on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online. The
CHA received and opened four bids. After analyzing the bid submittal materials, pre-award
survey meetings were held with the two lowest bidders. Both firms responded to questions on the
thoroughness of their bids, how they had developed their Division Costs, the amount of work
they planned to self-perform, whether any of the materials would be difficult to procure, and the
supervisory coverage they would provide at the work site. A Compliance Specialist reviewed
their bid materials and explained the new online compliance tracking system. Based on the
recommendation of staff, it was determined that that O.A.K.K. Construction Co., Inc. is the
lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $821,679.00. Accordingly, the Resolution for Item
B1 approves award of contract to O.A.K.K. Construction Co.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA -22
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 9,
2011, entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE A CONTRACT WITH
O.A.K.K. CONSTRUCTION CO., INC. FOR CAPITAL MAINTENANCE
REPAIRS AT 1500-02 S. CHRISTIANA (IL2-064), 1415-17 S. HARDING (IL2064) AND 1324 N. CLEAVER (IL2-131)”;
5

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

Co., Inc. in the amount of $821,679.00 for capital maintenance repairs at 1500-02
S. Christiana (IL2-064), 1415-17 S. Harding (IL2-064) and 1324 N. Cleaver (IL2131), Chicago, IL. The work is to be completed by no later than one hundred
twenty (120) calendar days from the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.

MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

(Item B2)
The resolution for Item B2 approves submission of a Demolition Application to HUD for the
demolition of Madden Park Field House located at 3800 South Rhodes. The Madden Park Field
House is within the Madden/Wells Revitalization Area located in the Douglas and Oakland
Community areas, and is roughly bounded by E. 35th Street on the north, the Illinois Central
Railroad tracks on the east, East Pershing Road on the south, and S. King Drive on the west. The
property and the land are owned by the Chicago Park District (CPD). The Madden Park land,
including the field house and pool, are in the process of being conveyed to the CHA via an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) dated December 27, 2010 wherein CHA and CPD have
mutually agreed to several land exchanges. In exchange for the CHA’s 412 W. Chicago land,
CPD will convey approximately 6.44 acres (278,784 sq. ft.) of its park land within the Madden
development area to CHA, which CHA plans to make available for future redevelopment under
the Plan for Transformation. Acquisition of the Madden Park land will complete the transaction
for the Cabrini land swap transaction to move forward. The CHA then will resume full
responsibility for security and maintenance of the field house. Since the Madden Park Fieldhouse
has been boarded since 2005, it is in a deteriorated condition, and the building has experienced
vandalism of plumbing and other building materials. The facilities budget has no funds available
to provide security and maintenance services therefore, immediate demolition is needed.
Redevelopment plans are at least three years in the future, and the building cannot be left in its
present condition.
RESOLUTION NO. 2011-CHA-23
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated February 9,
2011, entitled “Request for Authorization to Submit a Demolition Application to
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) for the

THAT

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to submit a demolition application to the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (“HUD”) for the demolition of 3800 South Rhodes and

into negotiations for a Master Development Agreement (MDA) and initiate revitalization

behalf of the CHA, issued a two step Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Request for Proposal
(RFP) procurement process for a Master Developer and Property Management Team for the
Washington Park redevelopment site. The RFQ, the first step, was to seek responses from
Developers experienced in the redevelopment of high quality, mixed-use urban properties with
the goal of short-listing a select group of Developers (Development Team) to proceed into the
second step, the RFP phase. The selected short-list respondents were asked to submit a detailed
development proposal. Following the proposal submittal, each short-listed developer was asked
to give presentations and oral interviews leading to the final Developer (Development Team)
selection. Brinshore Michaels Development Team will lead the redevelopment efforts to
construct a new mixed use – mix income development. In conjunction with Washington Park
Working Group, the development team will work to implement a redevelopment plan that should
6

 demonstrate a holistic green planning approach that incorporates smart growth urbanism, energy
efficient building designs and environmentally friendly renewable energy technology when
appropriate.

(Item C1)
The resolution for Item C1 approves the Purchase Option Payoff in connection with a Master
Equipment Lease held by Banc of America Leasing & Capital LLC in the amount of
$3,752,860.19. The CHA entered into several Energy Service Performance contracts between
1997-2003 totaling approximately $30,000,000. LaSalle National Bank (subsequently purchased
by Banc of America) funded these projects through various loans and capital leases, some of
which were funded by HUD under the subsidized ADD-On to Energy Performance Contracting
program and regulations. All of the HUD supported loans were paid off completely in December
2010. CHA has requested and negotiated a Payoff Purchase Option discount for the outstanding
balance under the existing lease agreement with Banc of America. Given the current interest rate
environment, early retirement of this lease obligation would enable the CHA to save over
$100,000.00 through the original maturity date of lease ending on 6/18/2013.
