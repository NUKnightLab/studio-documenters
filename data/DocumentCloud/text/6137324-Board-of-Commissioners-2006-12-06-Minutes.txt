appropriate for procurement under terms outlined in the issuance of a Request for Proposal, commonly
referred to as an "RFP"; and
WHEREAS, the technical and detailed nature of the process for development of an effective RFP may in
certain cases require assistance, advice, or oversight from professional consultants who are compensated

additional business with Cook County in the performance of duties or provision of goods and/or services
as described in the RFP; and
WHEREAS, among purchasing professionals in both the private and public sectors, commonly known
best practices in the industry are specifically designed to prevent such conflicts of interest when the

ordinance. The Purchasing Agent is expressly authorized to procure from any Federal, State, or local
government unit or agency thereof such surplus materials, supplies, commodities, or equipment as may be
made available through the operation of any legislation heretofore or hereinafter enacted without
conforming to the competitive bidding requirements of this ordinance. Regular employment contracts in
the County service, whether with respect to the classified services or otherwise, shall not be subject to the
provisions of this ordinance, nor shall this ordinance be applicable to the granting or issuance pursuant to
powers conferred by laws, ordinances, or resolutions, or franchises, licenses, permits, or other
authorizations by the County Board, or by departments, offices, institutions, boards, commissions,
agencies, or other instrumentalities of the County, nor to contracts or transactions, other than the sale or
lease of personal property pursuant to which the County is the recipient of money. (Ord. adopted Feb 20,

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005

Reason:

Under the contract, ESI is paid a percentage of the money it is able to bill and collect on the
County's behalf. At the time of execution, the Bureau estimated that ESI would be successful
in collecting approximately $60.6 million over the three-year contract, and thus, would be
entitled to collect $4.8 million dollars in contingency fees. Because ESI is projected to collect
more than was anticipated due to an increase in pharmacy prescriptions, the Bureau is seeking
approval to increase the contract amount by $4 million, in order to pay ESI the contingency
fee on the additional monies collected on the County's behalf. Actual collection to date is
approximately $75,000,000.00. Payment to this vendor is netted against revenues collected.
The expiration date of the current contract is January 31, 2006.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $4,000,000.00. Revised revenue generating estimate: $90,000,000.00.

The City of Chicago would like to request your support for its upcoming no-cash bid under the Tax

income citizens. Also, the program develops blighted, vacant, dilapidated and tax delinquent properties in
commercial and industrial areas.

CITY OF MARKHAM
NO CASH BID REQUEST

Transmitting a Communication from
DEBORAH SIMS, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee
Submitting a request from
DAVID WEBB, JR., Mayor
Re:

Cook County No Cash Bid Request from the City of Markham

The City of Markham is hereby submitting a no cash bid application of 70 parcels for scavenger sale or
over-the-counter bids. Redevelopment will benefit the City with new tax revenue, new residents and new
economic activity.
Project Description: This project is in the very beginning stage and the no cash bid request is the first
step. The parcels are in an area that was unincorporated Cook County until recently. The City annexed the
parcels in the past year. The parcels are vacant land and lack full infrastructure. The City seeks to build
new single family homes. Site plans have not been drawn as the City is researching density issues and
plating to best facilitate new residential use. Infrastructure upgrades and layout are also being researched
in order to best determine the development scope and layout. The acquisition of land from adjacent
owners is also being researched. Columbia Properties, Inc. is the third party requester. Columbia
Properties has an excellent track record with Markham and has the confidence of the City Council and the
City Administration. Completed projects by Columbia include one single family home and a new
commercial building for a Walgreen's. Columbia is also going forward on new construction of a
residential town home project that has been approved by the City.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005

The City will retain legal counsel, obtain tax deeds and pay all acquisition costs. The City will report as
required to the Cook County Office of Economic Development annually from the date of sale on each
parcel for five years or until the development is completed, whichever occurs last.

Commissioner Peraica suggested to the Chairman that the Commissioners need to review the Cook
County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance and the fiscal impact that the application has
on taxing bodies, the business community, and revenue generating sources for the County.
Chainnan Collins responded that at this time the Commissioners are moving forward on the Cook County
Forest Preserve District Budget and preparing for the Cook County Budget, there are too many things
going on. Chairman Collins also stated that she made a commitment to meet with the Assessor's Office
and review the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance with the State's
Attorney's Office to look at what is being done to come up with a process for accountability and to
determine what fiscal impact the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance will
have on Cook County.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Tuesday, November 29, 2005 at the hour of 1:00 P.M. in the Board
Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the purpose of this meeting is to provide the Cook County lobbyists with
an opportunity to provide a recap of the past year, and to share any issues that they anticipate will arise
during the coming year.
Chairman Suffredin requested that the following two booklets be entered into the record: "County
Lobbyists' Reports on the 2005 Regular and Veto Session in the Illinois General Assembly" and "End-ofSession Report to the Cook County Board and President on the 94th General Assembly 2005 Regular
Session." (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk).
Chairman Suffredin introduced Timothy Casey, Coordinator of Intergovernmental Affairs, Office of the
President, to present an overview of this year's Illinois House and Senate legislative session.
At Chairman Suffredin's request, Mr. Casey highlighted the following budget funds which the State
allocated to the County: $7.5 for Medicaid, $1 million to the Boot Camp, various public health grants,
and numerous grants under the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority for public safety programs.
Chairman Suffredin noted that, beginning on page 2 I of the "End-of-Session Report to the Cook County
Board and President on the 94th General Assembly 2005 Regular Session," there is a summary of all of
the line-item grants.
Mr. Casey noted the passage of Senate Bill 1509 regarding the obligation of the State to reimburse the
County for half of the cost to house parole violators. (See pg. 14 of "End-of-Session Report to the Cook
County Board and President on the 94th General Assembly 2005 Regular Session.") He further noted
that numerous counties were organized to submit a memo requesting to override the amendatory veto of
Senate Bill 1509, and that this method could prove useful again on other issues.
Steve Morrill, Lobbyist for Cook County Board of Commissioners, stated that no bills that the County
opposed passed. He provided an overview of the bills that the County supported that passed. These
include the following: HB 115, HB 2462, HB 3066, SB 75, SB 1443, SB 1444, SB 1509, SB 2053.
(These bills are detailed in the submitted, "End-of-Session Report to the Cook County Board and
President on the 94th General Assembly 2005 Regular Session.")
Chainnan Suffredin noted that these bills become effective on January 1, 2006, and that the process of
enacting them has begun.
Commissioner Daley stated that, from conversations he has had with Thomas Glaser, Chief Financial
Officer, his understanding is that the $8 million associated with SB 1444 will be the result of a shifting of
funds. Chairman Suffredin replied that the $8 million will be new revenue that will be generated by the
fee increase from $5 to $15. He further stated that he would confirm this with Mr. Glaser.
Chairman Suffredin inquired as to the existence of an election package, requested by the Clerk, that is
awaiting passage for the first week of January and that addresses several clean-up issues relating to early
voting. Mr. Morrill confirmed the existence of this package, and noted that it is Senate Bill 1445.

136

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005
Mr. Morrill next presented an overview of the following bills that the Board supported but that did not
pass: HB 339, HB 2416, SB 51, SB 204, SB 530, SB 1445, SB 1622, SB 1683, SB 1696 and SB 1697.
(These bills are detailed in the "End-of-Session Report to the Cook County Board and President on the
94th General Assembly 2005 Regular Session.")
Chairman Suffredin stated that the County may no longer want to pursue the passage of SB 51, which
relates to the Cook County TB Sanitarium District, because Dr. Martin is now on the Board and, also,
because a cooperative arrangement with the Cook County Department of Public Health has recently been
established.
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether Senator Harmon would have any desire to reintroduce this bill
if the County no longer desired to pursue it. Mr. Morrill replied in the negative.
In response to Vice Chairman Silvestri's request for clarification of SB 1445, Chairman Suffredin stated
that this bill now addresses only absentee voting and early voting.
Mr. Morrill clarified that while SB 1622 did not pass, the concept of the bill passed on another bill.
Mr. Morrill noted that no bills passed to which the Board opposed.
Mr. Morrill summarized the following bills that the Board opposed and which did not pass either House:
HB 644, SB 761 and SB 1727. (These bills are detailed in the submitted, "End-of-Session Report to the
Cook County Board and President on the 94th General Assembly 2005 Regular Session.")
Vice Chairman Silvestri inquired whether the Board should expect SB 1727 to return. Mr. Morrill replied
in the affirmative.
Vice Chairman Silvestri noted that it is his understanding that the leadership m the House ts not
supportive of this Bill. Mr. Morrill agreed.
Mr. Morrill commented on two additional issues: 1) regarding the Illinois First Grant, just before the
Veto Session the Governor released a $12 million Forest Preserve District Grant that had been awarded
during the George Ryan administration; and 2) the Assessor plans to run legislation next Spring to make
permanent the "7% solution."
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to when the grant money is due to be released. Mr. Morrill replied that
he did not know the answer to this.
Chairman Suffredin replied that the General Superintendent of the Forest Preserve District, Steven M.
Bylina, Jr., notified the Board that the entire $12 million is currently in the Forest Preserve District
Treasury. Commissioner Peraica voiced concern that it is his understanding that the Treasury possesses
only partial payment of this grant. Mr. Morrill stated that he would obtain this information and report
back to the Board.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the Committee will be holding a hearing at which the Assessor will
present his case. The Committee will draft a resolution.

137

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005
Chairman Suffredin delivered remarks on three additional issues. The Ethics Reform Bill passed the
House and is currently in the Senate. This bill has implications for members of both the Cook County
Board and the Pension Board. The Republican leader, Representative Cross, has put forth a bill which
seeks to transfer to the Chief Judge the power over the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. The Chief
Judge currently has power over all other fifteen Illinois juvenile detention centers. Chairman Suffredin
stated that he expects a number of bills to be put forth on this issue, and that the Committee should focus
on forming a consensus regarding legislation recommendations. Chairman Suffredin stated that he
expects the State to pass a capital program which will involve state matching funds of the federal funds
being supplied as part of the Federal Transportation Bill. He asked Mr. Casey to determine whether there
are any County highway projects that would qualify.
Mr. Casey stated that he would speak with Wally S. Kos, P.E., Superintendent of Highways, more
extensively to determine what funding is available. Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the duration of
the projects. Chairman Suffredin replied that the projects will most likely take longer than one year but
not as long as five years. Metra, Pace and the CTA are also pursuing grants.

Vice Chairman Silvestri moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Daley. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Jacqueline K. Harder, Economic Development Project Director, Cook County Department of Planning

and six pins are recommended for over-the-counter sale in 2006; this is because there are liens and the
City of Harvey apparently owns one of the pins.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005
Ms. Harder stated that 77 pins are for purchase over-the-counter. These were previously requested but
were subsequently vacated. Additionally, there are five pins that the Department issued grant funds for
the acquisition of, so the request is that all pins be purchased over-the-counter.
Chairman Sims emphasized the following to Judd M. Harris, the Attorney for the Village of Robbins.
She expects Mr. Harris to follow through and go to deed on these parcels because they have come before
the Board before and this is an important project for the Village of Robbins. There are state funds tied to
this project that will have to be reimbursed by the Village of Robbins if the project falls through.
Ms. Harder reassured Mr. Harris that the Clerk's Office indicated that all 77 pins could be processed
over-the-counter before the scavenger sale.
Commissioner Collins inquired what payment is required for an over-the-counter purchase made before
the scavenger sale.
Ms. Harder replied that it is a no cash bid.
Commissioner Collins inquired as to the specific projects slated to be developed on this land.
Mr. Harris replied that the Village of Robbins is still in discussions with developers.
Chairman Sims stated that Mayor Brody is working with a developer to create single-family homes and
town homes.
Commissioner Collins inquired whether the County receives a percentage of the profit that a municipality
earns when it sells a property to a developer.
Chairman Sims requested that Randy Kemmer, Assistant State's Attorney, clarify this issue.
ASA Kemmer replied that this is allowable by statute, because the County is acting as a Trustee for all of
the taxing bodies.
Commissioner Collins emphasized that she will be working with the Department of Planning and
Development and the Assessors Office on this issue. Specifically, the Department of Planning and
Development should require every municipality to file a long-term development plan.
Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved the approval of Communication
No. 271728, as amended (all 77 pins are recommended for over-the-counter sale in 2005). The
motion carried.

The Village of Steger has already retained legal counsel to obtain the tax deed, should they be
granted no cash bid status, and the Village of Steger will bear all legal and associated cost in
the acquisition of the parcels.

Development an annual report on the status of each parcel for five (5) years or until the
development is complete, whichever occurs last.

from Chicago Title Insurance Company.
Since there is some contamination by motor fuels on the site, the Village undertakes and
agrees that it will remediate the site upon obtaining ownership of the parcel.
Lastly, let me say how important this acquisition is for the Village of Steger. If these parcels
are obtained, the Village of Steger intends to spend upward of two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000.00) to modify the building so that it will be a first-class training facility and
operations facility for first-responders for fires and other disasters. The Village of Steger
implores you to give us this opportunity to obtain and develop first-class facility for Steger
and its surrounding communities.

CITY OF CHICAGO (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication from
Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee, submitting a request from Lori T.
Healy, Commissioner, City of Chicago.
Re: Cook County No Cash Bid Program Application on behalf of the City of Chicago
The City of Chicago respectfully requests permission to offer a no cash bid to acquire in the
2005 Scavenger Sale on the submitted list of tax-delinquent parcels.
Referred to the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee on 11/15/05.

Ms. Harder elaborated on the Department's recommendations regarding this application. These
recommendations are also contained in the Department's Report. Out of the total number of pins, the
Department recommends 391 for the 2005 Scavenger Sale. 299 other pins have liens; they are not
recommended for no cash bid at the 2005 Scavenger Sale. 56 other pins are not recommended for no cash
bid because, according to the City's application, the properties are either occupied-commercial or
occupied-residential buildings or are owned by the City of Chicago.
Ms. Linda D. Granderson, Deputy Commissioner, Department of Planning and Development, Real Estate
Services, City of Chicago stated that she hopes that these properties can be put back on the tax roll; some
properties will be devoted to affordable housing, and others to redevelopment.
Chairman Sims noted that the City is holding a meeting at this time, and that it is her understanding from
Ms. Granderson that once the City's meeting is finished, Ms. Granderson will deliver to her a copy of the
City's Resolution.
Chairman Sims noted that this morning she received a compact disk that contains the pins for the prior
acquisitions on behalf of the City through the no cash bids. This compact disk pertains to the Tax
Reactivation Project. She suggested that a meeting be held in the future to discuss this disk.
Commissioner Collins suggested that the Committee re-examine the State statute as it pertains to
scavenger sales.
Chairman Sims suggested that another area for review would be when a developer purchases a County
property and sells the certificate without ever having gone to deed on the property, thereby leaving the tax
burden on the purchaser.
Commissioner Peraica suggested that the County track the municipalities to determine that they have
fulfilled their commitment to the County.
Commissioner Moreno voiced his agreement with the concerns of Commissioners Peraica and Collins.
He added the following additional concerns regarding "sweetheart deals" and mega-developments,
delinquent taxes should be recouped by the County. Recipients need to be monitored to be certain that
they are utilizing exemptions for appropriate purposes. Statutes need to be written to prevent vacant lots
from being hoarded.
145

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005

Commissioner Butler stated that collaboration with the City of Chicago will be crucial in the pursuit of
reforming this issue.
At Chairman Sims request, Ms. Granderson agreed to call Chairman Sim's office with a contact person
from the City's Corporation Counsel's Office in order to set up a meeting in early 2006.
Commissioner Collins stated that she thinks that municipalities, in addition to the City of Chicago, should
be included as part of any ordinance that the County drafts.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved the approval of Communication
No. 274180, as amended, on the condition of receipt of the Resolution from the City of Chicago
before the Board meeting of December 6, 2005. (391 pin's are recommended for approval at the
2005 scavenger sale; 299 pin's with liens are not recommended for no cash bids at the 2005
scavenger sale; 56 pin's are not recommended for no cash bids because they are either occupied
commercial or residential buildings or owned by the City of Chicago; and 18 pin's were withdrawn
from the application.) The motion carried.
Commissioner Peraica voted present.

CITY OF HARVEY (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication from
Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee, submitting a request from Eric J.
Kellogg, Mayor, City of Harvey.
The City of Harvey is hereby submitting a no cash bid application for scavenger sale bids.
There are no third party requesters. Redevelopment will benefit the City with new tax
revenue, new construction, and new economic activity. The City will retain legal counsel,
obtain tax deeds and pay all acquisition costs. The City will report as required to the Cook
County Office of Economic Development annually from the date of sale on each parcel for
five years or until the development is completed, whichever occurs last.
Project Summary:
This no cash bid request is the first step of a citywide effort for redevelopment of abandoned
tax-delinquent parcels. Most parcels are residential vacant lot suitable for new residual
construction primarily for single-family homes. Some are vacant commercial lots. Some
have abandoned houses, garages or commercial buildings. There is one vacant industrial lot
and three lots that lie within a city street.
This request is the result of the City's comprehensive block by block survey of every parcel
in Harvey to identify tax delinquent forfeited parcels for future redevelopment. The no cash
bids at the upcoming scavenger sale give the City an efficient, cost effective way to acquire
these long abandoned properties for redevelopment. The current status of these tax
delinquent parcels is a serious hindrance to redevelopment. The many years of taxes due are
often more than the market values. Owners may be deceased, may have moved away or
refuse to take responsibility for the property. Speculators from previous scavenger sales with
minimal bids as low as $250.00 control the selling of parcels, but do not take ownership, pay
taxes or maintain the properties. With this program, the City can avoid these problems,
obtain the parcels and present clear deeds to developers and, when needed, help them
assemble adjacent parcels for a complete project.

146

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005
The City has been a significant increase in developer investment and interest in Harvey in the
past two years and is confident that by using this program we can facilitate new construction
in coming years. We will issue requests for proposals in 2006 and expect to break ground on
the first projects, likely new single-family homes. The City is committed to pay for costs to
obtain deeds through 2006 and 2007. Under redevelopment agreements, the City will obtain
reimbursement of our costs. In many cases the value of the land sold to developers will
exceed our costs, providing revenue.
Although the resolution has 1516 parcels, the City of Harvey will only be requesting 457
parcels at this time due to the increased amount of liens and other legal issues associated with
the additional parcels.
Referred to the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee on 11/15/05.

Ms. Harder recommended that 336 pins be approved for no cash bid at the scavenger sale. She
commented that the remaining pins appear to be residential side yards which have been maintained.
Some of them are fenced-in, may contain gardens and may have past ownership interest. If the City of
Harvey were to transfer the deed in these cases, these pins should not be eligible for no cash bids; this is
especially true if the owner has been in the chain of title. 28 pins contain liens or judgments from the City
of Harvey or Cook County; these are not recommended for the scavenger sale. 66 pins are owned by the
City of Harvey and appear to be occupied residential or commercial buildings and the Department of
Planning and Development does not recommend no cash bids on these parcels.
The Department of Planning and Development does recommend approval for the 28 pins with liens for
over-the-counter after the scavenger sale in 2006. Of the 454 pins received, a number of the packages
were submitted without complete documentation. The Department of Planning and Development is
unable to verify the completeness of 23 of these pins. These pins are not recommended for processing;
they are missing items and items whose eligibility the Department of Planning and Development was not
able to verify. Four pins were withdrawn at the request of the City of Harvey.
Chairman Sims noted that there is a correction to the agenda. The total number of pins being submitted
for recommendation is 454.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the follow-up on these parcels.
Ms. Harder replied that an annual report is filed with the County.
Chairman Sims stated that she has provided to the Committee a list of the municipalities that have
responded to the County. She stated that the Department of Planning and Development will be following
up with those municipalities that have not responded.
Commissioner Peraica inquired what sanction may be placed on the Village of Summit, which has not,
for ten years, stated its intention with regard to seven parcels.
Ms. Harder replied that the Ordinance states that the County Board may reject future requests.
Commissioner Peraica asked how recently the Board has applied this sanction.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005
Ms. Harder replied that she could not recall an instance.
Chairman Sims stated that a meeting is planned to address these concerns.
Commissioner Peraica requested that Chairman Sims obtain guidance from the State's Attorney's Office
in interpreting and applying the Ordinance.
Chairman Sims agreed to provide this in written form at the next meeting.
Randy Kemmer, Assistant State's Attorney, clarified in response to Commissioner Peraica's inquiries that
the only sanction in the Ordinance is the right of the Board and the Tax Delinquency Committee to deny
future requests by a municipality. Additionally, in any case where a municipality fails to make a required
payment pertaining to a no cash bid, the Board could pursue court action as it pertains to a broken
contract. Both state statutes and County ordinance govern this process.
Commissioner Butler requested that an examination of the City of Chicago's laws be included in any
written material submitted to the Committee.
ASA Kemmer agreed to provide this information to the Committee as well.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved the approval of Communication
No. 274181, as amended (336 pin's are recommended for approval of a no cash bid at the 2005
scavenger sale; 28 pin's with liens are recommended for processing for over-the-counter in 2006; 66
pin's are not recommended for no cash bids because they are either occupied residential or
commercial buildings or owned by the City of Harvey; 23 pin's have incomplete packages and are
not recommended for processing at this time and four pin's were withdrawn at the request of the
City of Harvey). The motion carried.
Commissioner Moreno moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
Respectfully submitted,
TAX DELINQUENCY SUBCOMMITTEE
DEBORAH SIMS, Chairman
ATIE ST: MICHELLE HARRIS, Secretary

Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved that the Report of the Tax Delinquency
Subcommittee be approved and adopted. The motion carried.

WHEREAS, the fifth grade students of St. Barbara Elementary School have diligently completed training
under the aegis of the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy Drug Abuse Resistance Education program
(D.A.R.E.); and
WHEREAS, the increasing pressure from undesirable social factors has the potential to lead today's youth
astray, thus programs like D.A.R.E. are necessary to provide students with the knowledge, self-esteem, and
strength of character to resist such pressure; and
WHEREAS, the students have benefited from the positive classroom environment maintained by their
teacher Miss Dorle Pomierski, and their D.A.R.E. program instructor, Officer Al Martinez of the Chicago
Police Department; and
WHEREAS, the fifth grade students of St. Barbara Elementary School have pledged to practice the D.A.R.E.
principals of saying "No" to the use of illegal drugs, and "Yes" to the benefits of a good education; now,
therefore
BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County salute the following
students from St. Barbara Elementary School's fifth grade on their outstanding achievements:
Arianna Adkins, Felicia Allen, Victoria Alvarez, Frank Balcer, Mireya Chavez,
Olivia DeLeon-Rodriguez, Anthony Flowers, Jr., Vanessa Garcia, Anna Hernandez,
Sophia Huang, Nicole Juarez, David Mata, Dansen Mayhay, Maribel Negrete,
Jessica Roberts, William Rolland, Alicia Sierra, Miranda Staranowicz and
Maricarmen Valerio; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution be presented to the fifth grade class at St.

THE HONORABLE JOHN H. STROGER, JR.
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, 22,671 Cook County residents are known to be living with HIV disease, and 3,010 of these
cases reside in Suburban Cook County; and
WHEREAS, despite focused prevention efforts, the number of Cook County living HIV cases is
doubling roughly every five years, and neither federal care nor prevention resources have kept pace with
this growth; and
WHEREAS, the federal Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act is a
health care "safety net" intended to fill gaps in public healthcare systems such as Medicaid, Medicare and
the Veterans Administration, and to meet critical healthcare and support service needs of Cook County
residents living with HIV who are low-income and/or uninsured; and
WHEREAS, 77% of Illinois' HIV disease cases reside in Cook County and Illinois and rely on over
$70,000,000 in Ryan White CARE Act funding each year to provide an array of HIV-related healthcare,
dental, mental health, substance abuse treatment, case management, medication reimbursement, legal
assistance, housing, nutrition counseling, and other essential services for uninsured persons living with
HIV disease; and
WHEREAS, the most recent CARE Act authorization law expired on September 30, 2005, and Congress
will soon consider new legislation to shape the future direction of CARE Act programs; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a reauthorization
proposal in July of 2005, that, if enacted, would severely reduce CARE Act funding for Illinois; and
WHEREAS, one of the provisions in the proposal requires funding formulas beginning in FY 2007 to
include the number of HIV cases, but the U.S. government has refused to accept data from Illinois
because it has collected HIV case reports by code, an option given to states in 1999; and

163

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 6, 2005
WHEREAS, on January 1, 2006, Illinois will begin collecting and reporting cases of HIV by name, the
federal government's preferred method, but health care providers will need additional time to report the
names of Illinois' 13,546 HIV infection cases, so that these cases, 47% of Illinois' living HIV/AIDS
cases, can be counted toward funding formula allocations; and
WHEREAS, other provisions recommended by HHS would result in dramatic funding reductions for
urban and suburban Cook County AIDS-related services and reduce already strained AIDS-related
healthcare and essential services facing a growing epidemic.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, BY THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS, that we urge the Congress of the United States to enact legislation retaining the
current "hold-harmless" provisions of the 2000 Ryan White CARE Act reauthorization, which protects
jurisdictions from large, destabilizing reductions in funding; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we urge Congress to use scientifically-derived estimates of the
number of people living with HIV/AIDS in U.S. jurisdictions for funding distribution purposes until HIV
surveillance systems are sufficiently accurate and complete across the nation to fairly base funding
decisions; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we urge Congress to retain prov1s1ons for local community
planning to ensure the most responsive, cost-effective use of resources to address the most critical unmet
needs for healthcare and other essential social support services for uninsured persons living with HIV
disease; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that copies of this Resolution be delivered to the President Pro
Tempore of the U.S. Senate, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Secretary of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Senators from Illinois, and each U.S. Congressional
Member representing Cook County.

Approved and adopted this 6th day of December 2005.

RESOLUTION

PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, the Illinois Judges Association, the Illinois State Bar Association and the Chicago Bar
Association all concur with the fact that there is a dire need to secure consistent, adequate funding from
the State of Illinois for the Cook County court system; and
WHEREAS, Illinois is way behind the rest of the nation to ensure appropriate funding for its court

system and more than thirty other states have figured out how to make this a reality; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that the State of Illinois finds a solution to address this funding inadequacy;

and
WHEREAS, in 1964, Illinois created a unified state court system that abolished the municipal court
system; prior to this change, each municipality, including Chicago, operated and funded its own court
system; and
WHEREAS, as a result of that change, Cook County Government today operates one of the largest court

systems in the world with more than 300 courtrooms and 1.7 million cases filed annually; and
WHEREAS, when this change occurred, the state provided little in terms of financial resources; this
resulted in counties being completely on their own to fund the court system, making it likely one of the
largest unfunded mandates in the history of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Judges Association's latest effort focuses on convincing the state that funding
the court system would allow for a "modem and efficient" court system fair to all its citizens and is a
"necessary step to maintain the judiciary as an independent branch of government;" and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Judges Association argues that in many counties throughout Illinois, one murder

trial can easily absorb the courts allocated resources for that year; in the case of Cook County, annual
spending on the court system exceeds $600 million dollars, with more than $170 million appropriated to
the Chief Judge's office.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of Cook, on behalf of its more than five

million residents, does hereby appeal to the State of Illinois to provide consistent and adequate funding
for the operation of the court system; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to State of Illinois
Governor, Rod Blagojevich to heighten awareness about this funding inadequacy.

Approved and adopted this 6th day of December 2005.
