Dear Dr. Anderson:
On behalf of Congress of Communities, I am writing to offer our full assistance in
purchasing and installing of a Child Friendly Space at the Patton Park Recreation Center.

The costs, approximately $6,000 are being borne by the group mentioned above.

These improvements will take place in August 2019. We have worked with community
representatives to ensure these improvements are desired.

Congress of Communities will not be responsible to maintain this site. After the
installation and approval, all maintenance and further responsibility for the Child
Friendly space will be passed onto the City of Detroit and the Patton Park Recreation
Center staff.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
