Event Description

The Armed Services Salute is three events on one continuous day of patriotic Veterans Day celebration in
downtown Detroit, anchored at Cass Park.

The Armed Services Salute is a collaboration between the Metropolitan Detroit Veterans Coalition (MDVC), Wins
for Warriors Foundation, founded by Justin Verlander and the 4Star 4Mile Race Committee. The Armed Services
Salute is a regional acknowledgement of SE Michigan?s role as the Arsenal of Democracy and is supported by the
VA, top ranking of?cers of active and retired military, bi-partisan political leadership and major corporations. The
2018 Armed Services Salute is the official celebration site for the WWI Centennial Commission honoring the
armistice that ended World War One and marks the origin of the Veterans Day holiday. It is also a designated
of?cial regional Veterans Day Celebration by the US Veterans Administration, one of only 25 across America.




2018 will be the 13th Annual Detroit Veterans Day Parade which draws thousands of diverse
participants marching to promote Patriotism and celebrate our veterans service on Veterans
Day. This year's parade will feature the nationally recognized Moslem Shrine Parade Corp.

the only race in the country which runs alongside a Parade. This is a partnership with Wins
for Warriors and the race is presented by The Michigan State Fair LLC. Participants dedicate
their run to a military member or service veteran. 






     
 

 

  

A free, family-friendly festival to celebrate Veterans Day with food, live music, activities
and exhibits by local veteran support organizations. Vets Fest is produced by Entercom
