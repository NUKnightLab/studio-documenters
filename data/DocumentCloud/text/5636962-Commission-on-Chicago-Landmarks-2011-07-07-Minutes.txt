 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
July 7, 2011
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on June 2, 2011, at 2:30 p.m. The meeting was held at
33 N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Bureau of
Planning and Zoning, Department of Housing and Economic Development

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

400 W. Dickens
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of 3-story masonry single-family residence and
detached masonry garage with alley access

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Residence:
1. The railings for the roof-top deck on the 3-story portion of the building
shall not be visible from the surrounding streets. The railings may be
set back from the parapet; or, alternatively, the height of the masonry
parapet should be increased (approx.1’-0¾”) to eliminate the need for
an additional railing (in doing do, the cornice could be moved one foot
higher to allow more space between the cornice and the upper-story
windows as part of increasing the height of the parapet);
2. As proposed, trees, plantings or other landscape elements or features
on the proposed roof decks should not be visible from the surrounding
streets. Such features shall be no higher than the railings/parapets or
otherwise set back from the parapet to minimize potential visibility.
Final roof landscape plans shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff with the permit application;

 3. Projecting balconies are not typical of the historic character of the
district. The 2’-6” deep projecting balconies proposed for the two sets
of french doors on the east façade shall be eliminated (although the
french doors may remain with juliet balconies). Alternatively, the
applicant may also consider changing the french doors to windows and
installing a canopy/roof with columns above the Sedgwick entry.
Final design details shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff with the permit application;
4. Historic metal cladding and decorative metal features of the district are
typically limited to projecting bays and cornices and have a dark
painted finish. The design of the 2-story corner entry portion of the
building, with its expansive use of metal cladding, in particular should
be further studied to be more consistent with the historic character of
the district, such as by: (a) simplifying the metal cladding, particularly
regarding the industrial design vocabulary of the metal panels and the
overtly historicist decorative elements such as the cornice; (b)
regularizing and providing greater symmetry to the fenestration
pattern, such as by incorporating obscured/spandrel glazing (rather
than ‘false’ metal panel windows) next to clear glazing at certain
locations; and (c) reconsidering the metal finish and color (see #7
below). The applicant may consider other options such as using brick
cladding for the east (Sedgwick) façade and an equal depth of the
south (Dickens) façade at the corner, thereby leaving a smaller metalclad portion on the south elevation (as designed, the location of the
stair) and reducing the overall expanse of metal cladding to be more in
keeping with the historic design conventions and architectural
vocabulary of the district. The treatment of the metal cladding in
general may change as a result of changes to the entry corner 2-story
portion of the building. Historic Preservation staff shall review and
approve final design details prior to the permit application;
5. The design of the fences shall be revised to eliminate the masonry
piers, which are not historically characteristic of the Mid-North
District; and the lower fence, proposed along portions of the east and
south property lines, shall be extended (with the same height or lower,
including without the stone bulkhead) to include the corner of Dickens
and Sedgwick to be more consistent with historic fences and the
treatment of corners in the district;
6. The color palette for the brick shall be further studied to be more
compatible with the district, particularly the predominant colors and
textures of the brick facades of the adjacent historic buildings and
block facades (i.e., the lighter tone brown/beige face brick typical of
the historic buildings on Dickens adjacent to the subject property or
red/orange/brown earth-tones on nearby Sedgwick). Historic
Preservation staff shall review and approve a final brick sample and
mortar color with the permit application;

 7. Zinc or lead-coated copper is approved for all metal features, including
all metal cladding, cornices and the entrance canopy as proposed.
Historic Preservation staff shall review and approve a final metal
sample and color with the permit application;
8. Final details of the entry door and sidelite, entry canopy, fences, and
windows shall be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation
staff with the permit application. The simulated divided-lite window
muntins shall have a substantial exterior profile;
9. The design of the proposed cornice shall be simplified so as not to
replicate historic design elements on a new building; and,
Garage:
10. The windows on the south elevation of the garage shall be taller in
height to be more consistent with the proportions of the more vertical
windows of the residence and those more typical of the district.
2.

658 W. Belden
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new 25-wide x 21’-tall retractable roof structure with clear
polycarbonate panels over outdoor dining area for tavern/restaurant

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The finish of the aluminum roof structure shall be a factory-applied
paint in a dark color, consistent with the adjacent commercial
storefront. In this limited instance, the clear polycarbonate roof panels
are approved, given that it is used for roofing of a semi-permanent
structure. A color sample of the aluminum paint and a sample of the
clear polycarbonate panel shall be submitted to Historic Preservation
staff for review and approval prior to order and installation;
2. Any signage, including any exterior lighting, shall be permitted
separately and reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff
prior to order and installation; and,
3. Any future new wall (to enclose the space for the winter) shall be
reviewed and approved by the Committee.

3.

1737 N. North Park
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of non-historic, straight-run front entry staircase
with a new L-shaped stair configuration

Action:

Approved unanimously as submitted.

 4.

1112 E. 48th
(Kenwood District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of two 2-story additions on the east and west sides
at the rear of a single-family residence

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The east wall of the east addition should not align with the east wall of
the historic building, but shall be set in a minimum of 1’-0” to better
differentiate it from the historic building as well as reduce its visual
impact from the street. (The Committee suggested that a more
substantial set back of 2 to 3 feet would be preferred to better
distinguish the new and the old construction);
2. The shape of the roof on the west addition shall be changed from the
proposed shed roof to a gable roof to be more in keeping with the
historic building;
3. Both additions shall be clad with brick at the first floor and stucco with
wood trim at the second floor to be more compatible with the
architectural vocabulary of the historic building; and,
4. New brick and slate shall match the existing brick and slate in color,
size, profile, texture, and finish. Samples of the new slate, brick,
stucco, and mortar shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for
review and approval prior to order and installation.

5.

852 N. Hermitage
(East Village District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of a rear addition and a shed roof-dormer on the
south side of a 2½-story gable-front masonry cottage

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The height of the front portion (7’-1 ¼”) of the proposed shed roof
dormer shall be lowered to the height required for stair clearance to
decrease visibility of the dormer from the public right-of-way. A
section through the dormer and stairs shall be included in the permit
plans. The height of the rear portion may remain as proposed;
2. Cement fiber siding shall have a smooth finish, and the lap exposure
shall match the typical lap exposure of wood clapboard found within
the district; and,
3. Historic Preservation staff to review and approve brick samples for the
proposed rear addition prior to order and installation. As proposed, the
brick shall match the color and texture of the existing common brick.
