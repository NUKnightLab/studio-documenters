SCOPE: NEW WINDOWS, LANDSCAPING, AND PARKING PAD
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Erected ca. 1911, the building located at 1718-1720 Van Dyke is a 2 ½-story duplex. The building is clad

projecting wing at the primary elevation. A partial-width, wood porch with wood decking shelters the front
entrance.
1718-1720 Van Dyke, current conditions

PROPOSAL
The current project proposes a complete rehabilitation of the property Historic District Commission staff
issued. As much of the work calls for in-kind replacement, staff approved a number of scope items on
9/13/2019. The remaining items call for the replacement of historic fabric and the installation of new

 hardscape and are therefore subject to review and approval by the Commission. Specific items which have
been submitted to this body for review include the following:
Hardscape/Landscape
• Remove two trees (arborvitae) at the rear yard
• Remove existing concrete garage slab at the rear yard
• Replace the existing chain-link fencing at the rear yard/alley
• Remove existing concrete walkways at rear yard
• A low masonry retaining wall is proposed between the parking area and rear lawn.
• Install a new masonry retaining wall with steps at rear yard
• Install a new 6-spaceasphalt parking lot at the rear yard
Windows
• It is the owner’s intent to repair as many windows as possible, however it is unknown the exact
conditions they will find when they start repairing the windows. Therefore, the owner is seeking
approval to replace windows that are deteriorated beyond repair with a matching custom-built
wood window constructed by either Pointe Hardware or Brooks Lumber.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• The applicant has provided photos of the windows which they are targeting for intervention. They
have noted that the windows are in poor condition and in need repair or replacement.
• The applicant has stated that the wood windows are not original. Rather, they appear to date from
the 1940s/1950s. It is staff’s opinion that the windows do appear to date from the 1940s/1950s.
Although the windows are not likely original, they are historic age (older than 50 years).
• A review of the HDC property files indicated that the satellite dish which is located at the front
elevation, second story, was installed without approval. The Commission reviewed the situation on
2/14/2001 and issued an approval to install a satellite dish, as long as it was installed on an area of
the house which is not visible from the public right-of-way. The applicant appealed the decision
and it was upheld by the State of Michigan, Michigan Department of State, Administrative Law
Division.
• A photo dating from 2001 and a review of Google Earth images indicated that the current front
porch columns were added without HDC approval sometime between 2001 and 2007. The porch
columns which were removed without approval were wood Tuscan columns as per the attached
photo.
ISSUES
• It is staff’s opinion that the existing wood windows can be repaired
• The existing satellite dish detracts from the home’s historic appearance and represents an ongoing
violation
RECOMMENDATION
As noted above, it is staff’s opinion that the windows proposed for replacement do appear that they can be
replaced. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission deny the issuance of a Certificate of
Appropriateness for the replacement of windows at 1718-1720 Van Dyke because the work does not meet
the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation, standard # 6) Deteriorated historic features shall
be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where

 possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
In re: to the proposed hardscape/landscape scope items, it is staff’s recommendation that the Commission
issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposal because these items meet the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, standards # 2.) The historic character of a property shall be
retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided and # 9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new
construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features
to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

 1718 Van Dyke – Window repair/replacement information
It is the owner’s intent to repair as many windows as possible, however it is unknown the exact conditions they will find
when they start repairing the windows. Therefore, the owner would like permission to replace windows that are
deteriorated beyond repair with a matching custom-built wood window constructed by either Pointe Hardware or
Brooks Lumber. Brooks or Pointe Hardware will also be providing replacement parts for windows that are being
repaired. Below is documentation for each of the windows. Note that this is a worst-case scenario – repair will be
attempted on the windows that are pictured. The openings are numbered on the floor plan below and interior and
exterior photographs follow for each opening. The windows/openings that are not numbered are confirmed to be in
good enough condition to be repaired. Note that none of the windows proposed for replacement are original – this
house was constructed about 1909 and would not have had 1 over 1 windows at that time. These windows are not
finely crafted historic wood windows, the sash and sills in particular seem to be from the 1940s or 50s.
In general the exterior frames and wood are dried and brittle, especially where the paint has failed, this has allowed for
significant sill and frame deterioration. Wood frames that look intact in photos may not be sound enough to survive
removal and repair of sash and operating parts.

 BASEMENT (windows not numbered) – All of the basement windows require replacement – some are missing, all of the
sills and frames are rotted due to neglect and water damage from the close proximity to the ground. Below are interior
and exterior photos of the majority of the basement windows showing typical damage. New windows will be wood to
match the existing opening size. The metal grills over the windows will be removed.

INTERIOR

Detail of damage

  

FIRST FLOOR WINDOWS (See numbers on plans above)
