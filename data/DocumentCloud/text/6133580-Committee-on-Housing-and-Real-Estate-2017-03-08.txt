CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF
PLANNING 8? DEVELOPMENT

LETTER FROM THE COMMISSIONER

We are pleased to submit the 2016 Fourth Quarter Progress Report, which presents the Department of Planning
and Development?s progress on the goals set forth in Bouncing Back, the City?s ?fth Five?Year Housing Plan
covering the years 2014?2018.

The Department of Planning and Development (DPD) is the lead agency for the City?s affordable housing,
housing preservation and homebuyer assistance programs. In 2016, the third year of the Five-Year Plan, the
Department committed almost $265 million to support 6,902 units of affordable housing. This represents 106%
of our annual resource allocation goal and 86% of our units assisted goal.

During the fourth quarter, the City approved funding for two multi-family development projects?giving us a
total of eleven for the year?and approved a financial plan for rehabilitation of a landmark North Side public

housing complex.

Once again, we would like to thank our many partners for their continued support and participation. We at
DPD could not succeed in our work without the ongoing support and cooperation of these valued partners?
neighborhood and business groups, elected officials, state and federal agencies, and other community stakehold?
ers. Through our combined efforts, we will continue to move forward in creating, preserving and supporting
affordable housing for the people of Chicago.

INTRODUCTION

Chicago Housing Plan 2014?2018

This document is the 2016 Fourth Quarter Progress
Report on the Chicago Department of Planning and
Development?s housing plan, Bouncing Baa/e: Five-Year Homing

Plan 2014?2018.

In 2016, DPD projected commitments of over $250 million to

assist more than 8,000 units of housing.

For the full year 2016, the Department committed almost
$265 million in funds to support 6,902 units, which represents
106% of the 2016 resource allocation goal and 86% of the

2016 unit goal.

 

l?1?l Quarter ending December 2016

 

 

 

CREATION AND PRESERVATION OF
AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS

In 2016 the Department of Planning and Development projected commitments of almost
$205 million to support more than 5,600 units of affordable rental housing using loans for
new construction or rehab along with rental subsidies.

For the full year, DPD committed more than $225 million in resources to support 4,873
units. These numbers represent 110% of the annual multi-family resource allocation goal
and 87% of the annual unit goal.

Multi?family Rehab and New Construction
McCrory Senior Apartments

A financial package approved by the City Council on November 1 will support the con?
struction of a new, 62?unit affordable apartment building for seniors on the Near West

Side.

The $17.4 million McCrory Senior Apartments, located at 1637?59 W. Washington
Boulevard in the 27th Ward, will feature a mix of one? and two-bedroom units, along with
a community room, fitness center, theater space, of?ces, laundry facilities and patio. All of
the units in the five-story building, to be developed by McCrory Senior Apartments LLC,
will be leased to seniors earning up to 60 percent of area median income (AMI).

City assistance will consist of $4.1 million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) funds and the
donation of four vacant parcels of City land valued at $697,500. Additional funding will
be provided by the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) through $12.2 mil-
lion in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit equity and $840,000 in Donations Tax Credit

equity.

East Park SRO

Also on November 1 the City Council approved the $16.6 million rehabilitation of a 153-
unit single?room occupancy apartment building in the East Gar?eld Park community.

Preservation of the East Park SRO, located at 3300 W. Maypole Avenue in the 28th Ward,
will be supported by $5.2 million in TIF assistance, $5.8 million in Low-Income Housing
Tax Credit equity, and up to $10 million in Housing Revenue Bonds for construction ?nanc?
ing. The project will also receive a $4.3 million loan from IHDA.

All apartments in the 21?year?old, five?story property will retain their project?based Housing
Choice Vouchers and continue to be affordable for tenants earning up to 60 percent of
AMI. Rehab work will include kitchen and bathroom upgrades, a new roof, lighting and
elevator repairs, a new HVAC system, new floors and carpeting, and an upgraded security
system. On?site services, such as substance?abuse treatment and employment training will
also be maintained.

Under the 2014 SRO Preservation Ordinance, DPD has committed to preserving 700 SRO
units over a four?year period. With the East Park project the City has now reached nearly
85 percent of this goal; we are well ahead of schedule to surpass it by 2018.

Updates to Previously Reported Developments

Fannie Emanuel Apartments

On November 1 the City Council authorized the City to transfer $8 million in bonding
authority to the Chicago Housing Authority to support the restoration of Fannie Emanuel
Apartments. The project originally was approved in October 2015 as a $64.4 million gut
rehab of the 181-unit senior building at 3916 W. Washington Boulevard in the 28th Ward.
The 2015 financial package included the City?s assignment of $35 million of its bond volume
cap to the CHA for interim and permanent financing.

After the deal closed in December 2015,
signi?cant deterioration of the exterior
masonry was discovered, necessitating
removal of the entire brick facade and
boosting total project costs to $74.9 million.
This in turn led to the need for the CHA to
issue additional tax?exempt bonds, and in
September 2016 they requested the City

to cede another $8 million in bond volume
cap for that purpose.

Permanent indebtedness will not increase
as a result of the additional bonds. They
will be repaid from higher LIHTC equity
generated by the bonds plus other CHA
funds if needed.

POLICY, LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS
AND OTHER ISSUES

New North Side TIF District Will Support
Lathrop Homes Redevelopment

A new Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district will support the mixed?income rehabilitation
of a landmark public housing development in the Ward under a plan approved on
October 5 by the City Council.

The redevelopment plan for the Julia C. Lathrop Homes complex includes approximately
1,100 mixed?income residential units to be constructed or rehabbed in multiple phases. The
$170 million ?rst phase will involve the renovation of fourteen buildings by Lathrop Com?
munity Partners LLC into a mix of 413 units ranging from studios to four-bedroom apart?
ments.

The new Diversey/ Chicago River TIF District is expected to generate an estimated $17.5
million for affordable housing construction and rehab along with new streets, utilities and
open space improvements. The 21?acre site, situated in the North Center and Lincoln Park
communities, is bounded by Wellington Avenue, Diversey Parkway, Clybourn Avenue,
Leavitt Street and the North Branch of the Chicago River.

Thirteenth Annual Rents Right
Housing Expo

On October 22 the 13th Annual Rents Right Housing Expo once again provided a con-
venient, one?stop opportunity for landlords and renters to learn more about their rights and
responsibilities. Co-sponsored by the Department of Planning and Development and the
Chicago Rents Right Committee, the expo is designed to deliver practical information about
con?ict resolution, building code violations, laws pertaining to evictions, maintenance issues
and other aspects of rental housing.

 

 

The free event was held at the Salvation Army Harbor
Light Corps Community Center, located at 825 N.
Christiana Avenue. It marked the 30th anniversary of
the enactment of the Chicago Residential Landlord and
Tenant Ordinance, which applies to landlords and ten-
ants of most rental properties containing more than six

 

units.

Participating agencies included several City departments,
Lawyers? Committee for Better Housing, Metropolitan
Tenants Organization, Community Investment Corpo?
ration, Access Living, Cabrini Green Legal Aid, Latino
Policy Forum, Spanish Coalition for Housing, Midwest
Pesticide Center, Northside Community Resources,
Northwest Side Housing Center and Home Depot.

Bilingual workshops covered topics such as the rights of
tenants and landlords under foreclosure, pest control and
building code violations. Attendees were eligible to enter a
drawing to win one of eight $25 gift cards.

Troubled Building Initiative Earns
National Leadership Award 

The City of Chicago?s Troubled Building Initiative has been honored by the Urban Land
Institute ?5 Terwilliger Center for Housing with the 2016 Robert C. Larson Housing Policy
Leadership Award, an annual recognition of the innovative ways in which the public sector is
addressing the nation?s affordable housing needs.

The award, announced in October at the ULI Fall Meeting in Dallas, recognizes Chicago for
acting aggressively to acquire and improve run?down buildings that pose a threat to commu?
nities and instead restore these vacant and abandoned structures to provide critically needed
low?priced housing. TBI was chosen by a jury of national housing industry leaders from a
group of ?nalist policies and initiatives that included programs in New York City, Virginia

and Iowa.

Through the Troubled Building Initiative, multiple City departments have worked hand-in?
hand with community?based groups to preserve more than 16,000 rental and for?sale units
across the city. These participating City agencies include not only the Department of Planning
and Development and Department of
Buildings, but also the Police Department,
Law Department, Department ofAdminis?
trative Hearings, Department of Family and
Support Services, and Department of Water
Management.

West Gar?eld Park
November 1, 2016 (originally approved October 14, 2015)

Assignment of additional $8 million in City bonding authority to
CHA to complete previously approved restoration of a vacant 181-
unit apartment building for independent seniors. The original
?nancial package included the City?s ceding of $35 million of its
bond volume cap to CHA for interim and permanent ?nancing.
Subsequently, severe deterioration of the exterior masonry was
discovered, necessitating removal of the entire brick facade and
increasing total project costs to $74.9 million. The CHA will issue
additional bonds to cover these unanticipated costs.

$43,000,000 in bonding authority ceded to CHA by City

As of (11, 2013, we report an ARC projects when they have paid their fee-in-lieu or have filed the affordable housing covenant securing construction of the required affordable units. This does not necessarily mean these units have begun construction, but does likely
mean that they were ready to begin construction, as the building permit may not be released until the covenant has been recorded Note also that report shows all projects approved by Council afterthe 2007 updates to the ARC.

Notes:

2808 North was originally reported as a Rental project in C11 2015 but converted to a For?Sale project in C13 2016

1600 5 Jefferson initially filed a restrictive covenant agreeing to proivde 3 affordable units on 8/2/2013: they subsequently elected not to provide on-site units and made thein?lleu payment ofS300,000 on 2/17/2016.

NOTE: Gross rent limits for 50% and 65% AMI, High HOME Rent and Fair Market Rent are published by HUD. All other rent limits are calculated assuming 1.5 occupants per bedroom and 1 occupant for an apartment with no bedrooms.

For HOME-iunded developments, rents are the "lesser of" the Fair Market Rent for the unit size or the High HOME Rent for the unit size. In HOME-funded developments with 5 or more units, 20% of the HOME-assisted units must be occupied by very-low
income families whose rents do not exceed 30% of the annual income at o-family whose income equals 50% of the area median This is known as the "Low HOME Rent."
