gov/cg QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

 

 
 
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
 

if the organization has never submitted qualifying information as a local civic organization, the
following information shall be submitted in the name of the organization prior to being approved to
conduct a bingo, millionaire party, raffle, or charity game. A previously quali?ed organization may be
required to submit updated qualification information to assure its continued eligibility under the act.

1. A signed and dated copy of the organization's current bylaws or constitution, including
membership criteria.

2. A complete copy of the organization's Articles of incorporation that have been filed
with the Corporations and Securities Bureau, if the organization is incorporated.

3. A copy of the letter from the IRS stating the organization is exempt from federal tax
under code 501(c)

 

OR 

copies of one bank statement per year for the previous five years, excluding the
current year.

4. A provision in the bylaws, constitution, or Articles of incorporation that states
should the organization dissolve, all assets, and real and personal property will revert:

A. if exempt under 501 to another 501(c)3 organization.
B. if not exempt under 501(c)3, to the local government.

5. A revenue and expense statement for the previous 12 month period to prove all assets are
used for charitable purposes, i.e. 990's, treasurer's report, audit. Do not send check
registers or cancelled checks. Explain the purpose of each expenditure made to an
individual. Once the organization has conducted licensed gaming events, the Bureau
may require the organization to provide additional proof that all assets are being used for
charitable purposes.

6. A copy of a resolution passed by the local body of government stating the organization is a
recognized nonpro?t organization in the community (form attached).

7. A provision in the bylaws, constitution, or Articles of incorporation indicating the
organization will remain nonprofit forever.

Additional information may be requested after the initial documents submitted have been reviewed.
If you have any questions or need further assistance, please call our office at (517) 335-5780.

 

Act 382 of the Public Acts of 1972, as amended, de?nes a local civic organization as an organization "that is organized not
for pecuniary pro?t; that is not af?liated with a state or national organization; that is recognized by resolution adopted by
the local govmnmental subdivision in which the organization conducts its principal activities; whose constitution, charter,
articles of incorporation, or bylaws contain a provision for the perpetuation of the organization as a nonprofit organization;
whose entire assets are used for charitable purposes; and whose constitution, charter, articles of incorporation, or bylaws
contain a provision that all assets, real property, and personal property shall revert to the bene?t of the local governmental
subdivision that granted the resolution upon dissolution of the organization."

Educator 
Request:

The above recommendation is at the request of Angelique Rodriguez-Edge from the Health Department.

Rationale:

The above request and recommendation is based on the ability to attract and retain essential personnel to
staff the Ryan White Program of the Health Department.

The SEMHA federal contract is due to end June 30, 2019. It has been determined that it is in the City?s best
interest that the Ryan White Program be moved in?house. The existing classi?ed title of Senior
Public Health Educator has no incumbents and will be reactivated to accommodate the transfer of staff
performing this work. This transition is necessary to ensure that the program is more cost effective,
operates more ef?ciently, and adheres to regulatory guidelines.

To determine the appropriate salary range for the classi?cation, a market study was conducted using data from
external survey sources. The proposed salary is essential for recruitment and retention purposes and is based
on the City of Detroit?s ability to fund the increase. The proposed salary recommendation is subject to City
Council approval.
