by
LAURA LECHOWICZ FELICIONE, Special Legal Counsel
RE:

Executive Order 2010-2

submitting hereto, please find Executive Order 2010-2 executed by President Toni Preckwinkle, today
January 4, 2011. Please execute and certify receipt of the order and distribute accordingly.
Submitting an Executive Order by
TONI PRECKWINKLE, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
EXECUTIVE ORDER 2010-2
WHEREAS, it is essential that all Cook County employees, officers and appointees meet the highest
ethical standards and discharge their duties in a responsible and ethical manner; and
WHEREAS, Section 2-587 of the County’s Code of Ethical Conduct requires that “[e]ach elected
official, members of each elected official's personal staff and each employee holding a senior
administrative service position with the County, upon due notice, shall attend an ethics education seminar
offered on a regular basis by the Board of Ethics within 120 days of the effective date of this amendatory
ordinance or within 120 days of becoming an elected official, becoming a member of an elected official's
personal staff, or holding a senior administrative service position with the County (or as soon thereafter as
an ethics education seminar is offered by the Board of Ethics) and every four years thereafter; and
WHEREAS, the ethics education seminar required under Section 2-587 of the County’s Code of Ethical
Conduct serves to educate persons in upper level management as to their duties and responsibilities under
the County’s Ethics Act; and
WHEREAS, in addition to the County’s ethics code, there are a number of laws established by Cook
County which establish ethical standards and provide penalties for their violation, including without
limitation, the prohibition of unlawful practices relating to employees and employment and the
prohibitions of political discrimination; and

2

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 4, 2011
WHEREAS, it is essential that all Cook County employees, officers and appointees be aware of and
understand the required ethical standards; be prepared to address ethical issues and act in a manner that is
in compliance with the County’s rule and regulations under the ethics ordinance as well as other
ordinances that address ethical standards; and
WHEREAS, the County’s current ethics ordinance does not require a significant number of employees to
attend the mandated ethics education seminar; however, Cook County has a compelling interest in
insuring that all County officers, employees and appointees are fully aware of their ethical duties and
responsibilities; and
WHEREAS, it is the purpose and intent of this Executive Order to mandate broad ethics training to all
employees, officers and appointees under the jurisdiction of the County Board President in order to
inform all employees, officers and appointees of their ethical duties and responsibilities by instituting
mandatory ethics training.
NOW THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the State of Illinois,
the laws of the State of Illinois, and the Ordinances of Cook County; and
I, TONI PRECKWINKLE, President of the County of Cook, DO HEREBY ORDER, as follows:
1.

All employees and officers under the jurisdiction of the County Board President, the
Cook County Health and Hospitals System (“CCHHS”) and the Forest Preserve District
of Cook County (”District”) will be required to complete, at least annually, ethics training
offered by the Cook County Board of Ethics.

2.

Within the next 180 days, a broad ethics training program will be developed and
instituted via on-line which will be used to educate and train all employees and officers
under the jurisdiction of the County Board President, CCHHS and the District regarding
the provisions of the Ethics Act as well as various other ordinances that impose ethical
standards on County and District employees. The on-line ethics training seminar will
provide education on the ethics rules and requirements and will address the range of
ethical issues that employees and officers face in the discharge of their duties. The online training program will be an efficient tool to ensure annual training requirements are
met and to train employees as a condition of hire.

3.

Upon the implementation of the on-line ethics training program, as a condition of hire, all
new employees or re-hires under the jurisdiction of the County Board President, CCHHS
and District will be required to complete ethics training within 90 days of their effective
date of hire or within 90 days of the on-line program being operational.

IT IS FURTHER REQUESTED, that all offices of Cook County government, including the offices of
the eleven separately elected County-wide officials and the seventeen member County Board expand
ethics training and require all their employees and officers to undergo ethics training in the manner as
ordered above.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that members of my staff, the Director of Ethics, Human Rights and
Commission on Women’s Issues as well as the Chief Information Officer work together in the timely
development and implementation of the on-line ethics training program.
I FURTHER ORDER, that this order shall take effect upon its execution and filing with the County
Clerk and that immediate notice of this order be delivered by the County Clerk to the offices under the

jurisdiction of the County Board President, the eleven separately elected officials, the seventeen members

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 15, 2010 from
JOSEPH BERRIOS, Cook County Assessor
by
CHRISTINA VILLARREAL, Legislative Liaison
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc. Chicago, Illinois, for publication of the state mandated publications as follows: proposed
assessed values for the 2011 real estate triennial assessment of the South Townships outside the city of

63

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 4, 2011
Chicago; revisions made to the 2011 triennial assessment in South Townships outside the city of Chicago,
after publication of the initial triennial assessment publication; 2011 triennial assessment list in additional
newspapers for additional public notification as directed by the Assessor's Office; revisions made to the
2011 real estate non-triennial assessment of North Townships outside the city of Chicago; and revisions
made as a consequence of the change in assessment practices to the 2010 real estate assessment of North
townships outside the city of Chicago.
Reason:

Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. has been the sole-source vendor for the publication of
Cook County's suburban townships assessment list since 2002. Prior to 2002, this same
entity published the assessment list for many years. During this time, prior to 2002, Cook
County Suburban Publishers, Inc. was the only vendor to submit a response when the annual
contract was sent out to bid. State statutes (35ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 et seq.)
impose strict guidelines as to who may publish the assessment list for Cook County's
suburban townships. Therefore, due to the timely nature of publishing the assessment list, the
Assessor's Office requests that this contract be sole-sourced to Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $597,441.28. Contract period: May 1, 2011 through April 30, 2012. (040-240
Account). Requisition No. 10400003.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2011 funds.
_________________________
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be
authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY
APPROVAL OF PAYMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 2, 2010 from
ELIZABETH MELAS, Deputy Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $164,000.00 to Anchor Mechanical, Inc., Chicago,
Illinois, for the rental and installation of an Emergency Temporary Boiler at the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center-West Addition.
Reason:

This was a one time purchase in which the vendor chosen was the successful bidder for the
system described above. Anchor Mechanical, Inc., sought various boiler rental companies
and found only two boilers immediately available. An Emergency Temporary Boiler was
rented until a boiler purchased by the County could arrive and be installed.
Under normal conditions the building had three operating boilers. However, two boilers were
not functional, one boiler cannot maintain adequate building temperature. Had that boiler
failed we would have had to close the facility.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $164,000.00.
32000 Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.
This item was included in the FY 2009 Capital Improvement Program approved by the Board of
Commissioners on April 2, 2009.

Mechanical, Inc. be made. The motion carried unanimously.

GRADE 24 ADJUSTMENTS
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 17, 2010 from
WARREN L. BATTS, Chairman, Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board
and
WILLIAM T. FOLEY, Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System
In accordance with Resolution 10-R-03 approved and adopted December 1, 2009, by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners regarding the adjustment of any Grade 24 positions, I am presenting the
following Grade 24 adjustments for your approval:
System – Director of Development and Training (Human Resources)
Tiffany Dotson
$149,999.98
New Hire: The position was created to support Vision 2015 and the full range of employee related
development initiatives to ensure the successful implementation of the CCHHS strategy, improve
caregiver/employee satisfaction and develop a robust program for in-service education and professional
skill building. This position supports Strategic Plan Goal III – Staff Development. Available Market Data
indicates a median salary for a position of this type at $148,000.00.
Oak Central Fill Pharmacy – Pharmacy Manager
Joseph A. Chimienti
$134,707.04
New Hire: The position was created for the Oak Central Fill Pharmacy to oversee the processing of refills
for system pharmacies (Fantus, Stroger, Oak Forest and Provident); to bring mail order services currently
provided by an outside contractor in-house; and to relieve additional workload from the local pharmacies
in order to decrease the turnaround time for patients waiting onsite for prescriptions. The precedent for
this salary was set by the CORE Center pharmacy manager, a CCHHS employee whose salary is
$134,500. The candidate is highly qualified with 24 years of experience. He has managed the mail order
pharmacy for the company currently under contract to provide services to our patients. The anticipated
savings to CCHHS for bringing these services in-house is approximately $3 million annually. Available
Market Data indicates a median salary for a position of this type at $124,301.00.
The adjustments to the Grade 24 positions will be funded from the 110 Account. Pursuant to Resolution
09-R-526 the System Board has authority to transfer funds in and out of the 100 Services Accounts
(Personal Services); therefore the above adjustments are within the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System FY2010 appropriation.
The Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board of Directors reviewed the above Grade 24s at their
meeting of December 17, 2010.

FY2011 PRELIMINARY BUDGET
Transmitting a Communication dated January 3, 2011, from
WARREN L. BATTS, Chairman, Cook County Health & Hospitals System
and
WILLIAM T. FOLEY, Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System Board of Directors approved their FY 2011 Preliminary
Budget on November 19, 2010. That budget was submitted to the County Board on December 14, 2010
and referred to the Finance Committee (Communication No. 310247). Subsequent to the Health System’s
submittal of its Preliminary Budget on December 14, 2010, the President’s Budget Department informed
the Health System that it would be necessary to revise its Preliminary Budget to include certain fixed
costs that have historically been budgeted and expensed through Account 899, Fixed Charges and
Special-Purpose Appropriations for Health, which account was previously placed under the budgets of the
Office of the President. These items include costs related to employee benefits, centralized
communications and the malpractice, employee and general liability claim reserves. For FY 2011, the
President’s Budget Department has transferred these costs to the Health System’s budget which transfer is
now reflected in the Health System’s Revised FY 2011 Preliminary Budget.
In addition, after adding these Account 899 costs to its Preliminary Budget, the Health System was asked
to further reduce its overall expenditures. Accordingly, on January 3, 2011 the Health System Board of
Directors held a Special Board Meeting to adopt a Revised FY 2011 Preliminary Budget. The Revised
FY 2011 Preliminary Budget incorporates the additional expenses of Account 899 and further reduces the
Health System’s overall expenses.
Specifically, at its January 3, 2011 Special Board Meeting, the System Board of Directors approved a
motion to revise the Health System’s FY2011 Preliminary Budget submission, to increase the total budget
to $914.835 million by the addition of certain line items in Account 899, as submitted by the Budget
Department of the Office of the President, which expenses totaled $106.392 million, and by further
reducing unspecified appropriation adjustments by $8.831 million.
The following is a summary of the revisions to the Health System’s FY 2011 Preliminary Budget:

FY2011 Preliminary Budget (approved 11/19/10)
Proposed Revision – Add Account 899 expenses
Proposed Revision – Unspecified negative appropriation adjustment
FY2011 Revised Preliminary Budget Total

(in millions)
$817.275
106.392
__(8.831)
$914.835

Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System respectfully
submits the above referenced revisions to the Health System’s FY 2011 Preliminary Budget submitted to
the County Board on December 14, 2010 as the Health System’s Revised FY 2011 Preliminary Budget as
approved by the System Board of Directors on January 3, 2011.
