2. Administrative Report
a. Open Enrollment
Nickol R. Hackett, Executive Director, reported that the Open Enrollment meetings for
retiree health benefits took place on three different days at various locations in early
November. The member turnout was increased over previous years largely due to the change
in the plan administrator to United Healthcare and because two sessions were held in
suburban locations. Brenda Deming, Director of Health Benefits, added that the Fund fielded
approximately 3,500 calls from members in the Open Enrollment period which represented
an increase of about 30% from the previous years. She also stated that most callers found
some benefit from the change after interaction with Fund staff. Ms. Deming also reported
that members were interested in receiving paper directories of the providers who participate
in the plan. The Trustees discussed the costs associated with providing complete directories
to all participants and the possibility of providing versions that were modified to more
closely reflect the members’ geographical locations.
b. Travel Approval – Callan National Conference
The Executive Director provided the Board with requests from Fund staff to attend to
different conferences relating to due diligence and to the fiduciary obligations of pension
plans.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Fitzgerald that expenses,
including any related travel expenses incurred by Fund staff in attending the 2015 Callan 35 th
National Conference in San Francisco, California, on January 26-28, 2015, at a projected cost
of $1,800 per attendee be approved provided that any reimbursement be in and for amounts

3. Legislative Update
Mary Pat Burns summarized the status of pension reform litigation and other legislative
matters. She stated that the pension reform legislation relating to the State funds had been
ruled unconstitutional by the Circuit Court of Sangamon County and was directly appealed to
the Illinois Supreme Court. It was anticipated that the appeal would proceed on an expedited
schedule, but that the Illinois Supreme Court had not yet determined that it would proceed in
that manner. Ms. Burns also reported that because of the decision of the Illinois Supreme
Court in Kanerva, the affected State funds were required to return health benefit premiums to
members. She also stated that the Supreme Court took up a case on appeal relating to
Chicago Transit Authority’s health care trust which concerns a board’s liability for setting
health care rates. The decision in that case could affect how the Retirement Board approaches
retiree health benefits and the Fund might consider filing an amicus brief. Finally, Ms. Burns
reported that no action was taken in the fall veto session on any pension bills, including those
bills proposed for only technical corrections.
4. 2015 Budget Presentation
a. 2015 Budget Approval
The Executive Director presented an overview of the 2015 Budget for the Fund. She stated
that while the investment portfolio is increasing, the outflows are also increasing at about the
same rate. The Executive Director stated that the budget reflected the need to correct the
Fund’s underinvestment in its Information Technology requirements and to redirect its focus
from anticipated pension reform to prospective planning. She also noted that the Fund
salaries reflected staff attrition and few new hires. Michael Maratea, Director of Finance,
provided further information on the IT needs of the Fund. He stated that consultants had
been retained to plan for improvements to the infrastructure which included upgrades to
internet connections and a planned reduction from 12 servers to 3 servers which will improve
efficiencies in the system.

 The Trustees discussed the need to make information available to both active members and to
retirees. They also discussed the possibility to plan for secure access from the website to the
members’ individual records to assist in their retirement planning. Ms. Hackett informed the
Board that website planning is a key priority for 2015 and member access and security would
be part of the evaluation.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Goode, consistent with the
recommendations of the Fund’s staff, that the Board adopt the Fiscal Year 2015
Administrative Budget.
