COOK COUNTY NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION HOMEOWNER
EXEMPTION ORDINANCE (“N.P.H.E.”)
PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, the County of Cook, Illinois, is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and pursuant to the authority therein granted, may
exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the reassessment system in the County of Cook causes a shift of the tax burden; and
WHEREAS, the shifting tax burden often results in homeowners receiving significant, unpredictable
increases in their property tax bills, causing severe financial hardship for them; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners previously recognized this issue for mixed use
residential property and Class 3 rental property by reducing the applicable assessment levels; and
WHEREAS, on July 12, 2004, the 93rd General Assembly of Illinois enacted Public Act 93-0715, which
authorized a county to adopt an alternative general homestead exemption, 35 ILCS 200/15-176, (“7%
assessment cap”); and

2

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
WHEREAS, on July 13, 2004, the Cook County Board of Commissioners adopted by ordinance (04-O33) the provisions of the alternative general homestead exemption, 35 ILCS 200/15-176; and
WHEREAS, effective October 12, 2007, the 95th General Assembly of Illinois overrode the Governor’s
Amendatory Veto (Public Act 95-0644), and extended the alternative general homestead exemption for
another triennial for each reassessment district; and
WHEREAS, on October 22, 2007, the Cook County Board of Commissioners adopted by ordinance (07O-73) the provisions of the alternative general homestead exemption, 35 ILCS 200/15-176 (Public Act
95-0644); and
WHEREAS, the 7% assessment cap resulted in a taxable value that grows more predictably, allowing
homeowners the peace of mind of being able to plan and anticipate their tax bills; and
WHEREAS, the 7% assessment cap provided an immediate and effective form of property tax relief
available to homeowners in the County of Cook; and
WHEREAS, the 7% assessment cap is but one aspect of the effort to stop the ever increasing tax burden
on the neighborhoods of Chicago and Cook County, with the long-term goal of restructuring a fairer and
more predictable property tax system; and
WHEREAS, Illinois’ tax structure is over-reliant on property taxes to fund schools and local taxing
districts and is in need of major reform; and
WHEREAS, Cook County homeowners have relied upon and have benefited from the 7% assessment
cap as a reliable form of property tax relief from the shifting tax burden; and
WHEREAS, on August 2, 2010, the 96th General Assembly of Illinois enacted Public Act 96-1418,
which extended the alternative general homestead exemption for another triennial for each reassessment
district; and
WHEREAS, the County Board is desirous of implementing the provisions of 7% assessment cap as
provided in Public Act 96-1418.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
COUNTY OF COOK, ILLINOIS, PURSUANT TO PUBLIC ACT 96-1418, THE COUNTY OF

assessment books are certified to the County Clerk by the County Board of Review, the
Assessor shall furnish to the Clerk a list of properties qualified for the alternative general
3

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
homestead exemption. The list shall note the adjusted homestead value of each property
to be used in the calculation of the homestead exemption for the current tax year.
(2)

Exemption amount. The amount of the alternative general homestead exemption is the
equalized assessed value of the homestead property for the current tax year, minus the
adjusted homestead value, with the following exceptions:
a.

b.

The amount of the exemption shall not exceed $20,000.00 in equalized assessed
value for any taxable year through taxable year:
i.

2005, if the general assessment year for the property is 2003;

ii.

2006, if the general assessment year for the property is 2004; or

iii.

2007, if the general assessment year for the property is 2005.

Thereafter, the amount of the exemption is as follows:
i.

if the general assessment year for the property is 2006, then the
exemption amount may not exceed: $33,000 for taxable year 2006;
$26,000 for taxable year 2007; and $20,000 for taxable year 2008; and
2009; $16,000 for taxable year 2010; and $12,000 for taxable year 2011;

c.

For the 2006 taxable year only, the maximum exemption amount provided in
subsection (2)(b)(i) of this Section may be increased by: (i) $7,000 if the
equalized assessed value of the property for taxable year 2006 exceeds the
equalized assessed value for taxable year 2002 by 100% or more; or (ii) $2,000 if
the equalized assessed value of the property for taxable year 2006 exceeds the
equalized assessed value for taxable year 2002 by more than 80% but less than
100%.

In the case of homestead property that also qualifies for the exemption under
Section 15-172 of the Property Tax Code, the property is entitled to the
alternative general homestead exemption limited to the amount of (i) $4,500.00
for tax year 2003; (ii) $5,000.00 for tax years 2004 and 2005; or (iii) the lesser of
the amount of the general homestead exemption under Section 15-175 or an
amount equal to the increase in the equalized assessed value for the current tax
year above the equalized assessed value for 1977 in tax year 2006 and thereafter.

4

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
(3)

Initial value subject to review. For any tax year for which the Assessor determines or
adjusts an initial value for base homestead value purposes, the initial value shall be
subject to review by the same procedures applicable to assessed values established by the
Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/1 et seq., for that tax year.

(4)

Revision of base homestead value. The base homestead value shall remain constant,
except that the Assessor may revise it under the following circumstances:
a.

If the equalized assessed value of a homestead property for the current tax year is
less than the previous homestead value for that property, then the equalized
assessed value for the current tax year shall become the base homestead value in
subsequent tax years, provided it is not based on a reduced assessed value
resulting from a temporary irregularity in the subject property.

b.

For any tax year in which new buildings, structures, or other improvements are
constructed on the homestead property that would increase its assessed value, the
Assessor shall adjust the base homestead value with due regard to the value
added by the new improvements.

c.

Except to sales or transfers between spouses or between a parent and a child, if
the homestead property is sold or ownership is otherwise transferred after
December 31, 2002, the base homestead value of the property shall be adjusted
as provided in subdivision (b)(3)(b) of Section 15-176 of the Property Tax Code,
35 ILCS 200/15-176.

d.

Pursuant to the recalculation of the base homestead value as provided in
subdivision (b)(3)(A-5) of Section 15-176 of the Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS
200/15-176.

(5)

Cooperatives or life care facilities. In the case of an apartment building owned and
operated as a cooperative, or as a life care facility, that contains residential units that
qualify as homestead property under Section 15-176 of the Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS
200/15-176, the maximum cumulative exemption amount attributed to the entire building
or facility shall not exceed the sum of the exemptions calculated for each qualified
residential unit. The cooperative association, management firm, or other person or entity
that manages or controls the cooperative apartment building or life care facility shall
credit the exemption attributable to each residential unit only to the apportioned tax
liability of the owner or other person responsible for payment of taxes as to that unit. Any
person who willfully refuses to so credit the exemption is guilty of a Class B
misdemeanor.

(6)

Married persons maintaining separate residences. When married persons maintain
separate residences, the homestead exemption provided under Section 15-176 of the
Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/15-176, shall be claimed by only one such person and
for only one residence.

(7)

Sale or transfer of homestead property. In the event the homestead property is sold or
ownership otherwise transferred after December 31, 2002, other than sale or transfers
between spouses or between a parent or child, the homestead exemption provided under
Section 15-176 of the Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/15-176, shall remain in effect for
the remainder of the tax year and beginning with the 2006 taxable year, the exemption
5

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
shall be calculated using the same base homestead value in which the sale or transfer
occurs, but for any subsequent tax year it shall be calculated using the new base
homestead value as provided in subdivision (b)(3)(b) of Section 15-176 of the Property
Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/15-176. The Assessor may require the new owner of the
homestead property to apply for the exemption in the following year.
(8)

State law provisions. The provisions of the homestead exemption as provided under
Section 15-176 of the Property Tax Code apply as follows:
a.

If the general assessment year for the homestead property is 2003, this exemption
applies for assessment years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 through
2011. Thereafter, the provisions of Section 15-175 of the Property Tax Code, 35
ILCS 200/15-175, apply.

b.

If the general assessment year for the homestead property is 2004, this exemption
applies for assessment years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 through
2012. Thereafter, the provisions of Section 15-175 of the Property Tax Code, 35
ILCS 200/15-175, apply.

c.

If the general assessment year for the homestead property is 2005, this exemption
applies for assessment years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 through
2013. Thereafter, the provisions of Section 15-175 of the Property Tax Code, 35
ILCS 200/15-175, apply.

to calculate the seven percent (7%) assessment cap homestead exemption in accordance
with this section.

(2)

The Clerk shall have the authority to compute tax rates, to remove the seven percent (7%)
assessment cap homestead exemption value from the calculation of the property tax bill
and to provide this information to the County Treasurer to implement the provisions of
this section.

WHEREAS, for twenty years, Mr. William R. Quinlan has served the people of Cook County on a pro
bono basis as Chairman of the Cook County Judicial Advisory Council (JAC) and, since his appointment
in April of 1991, has served four successive administrations, those of Presidents Richard J. Phelan, John
H. Stroger, Jr., Bobbie L. Steele, and Todd H. Stroger; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Quinlan has worked tirelessly to fulfill the statutory goal of the JAC to study and devise
means to improve the administration of justice in Cook County and has brought to this mission his
considerable legal experience and knowledge garnered as Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago
from 1974 to 1980 under Mayor Richard J. Daley, as Cook County Circuit Court Judge from 1980 to
1985, as Appellate Court Judge from 1985 to 1989, as Parliamentarian for the Cook County Board from
1992-2006, and as named partner in respected private law firms over the past two decades; and
WHEREAS, in his capacity as JAC Chairman, Mr. Quinlan was instrumental in the administration’s
efforts to obtain fair funding mechanisms for federal public safety grant programs, which resulted in over
$35 million of funding for crime prevention programs that the County could not otherwise have afforded
and that have benefited tens of thousands of Cook County youth and their families; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Quinlan established a funding procurement program that resulted in the JAC staff’s
obtaining millions of dollars of needed outside funding for improvements to the juvenile justice system,
including federal and private funding for alternatives to juvenile detention and state funding for the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, with reforms so significant that the Annie E. Casey Foundation
named Cook County a model site in the Juvenile Detention Alternative Initiatives movement; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Quinlan established a program by which the JAC staff’s legislative analyses have
alerted legislators of potential fiscal impacts upon Cook County of proposed penalty-enhancing state
criminal and juvenile justice legislation and have resulted in millions of dollars of cost avoidance for
Cook County through defeat or amendment of costly bills over the past several decades; and
WHEREAS, JAC Chairman Quinlan, in his capacity as unpaid Chairman of the Cook County Criminal
Justice Coordinating Council, has, since 1989, devoted his time and energy to chairing frequent meetings
of elected officials and criminal justice system decision makers, including the Cook County Sheriff, the
State’s Attorney, the Public Defender, the Chief Judge of Cook County’s Circuit Court, the Presiding
7

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
Judge of the Criminal Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County, the Clerk of the Circuit Court of
Cook County, the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, and other local and state leaders, and
this successful cooperative effort has helped Cook County reduce the Jail crowding that has been the
subject of two federal constitutional consent decree cases since 1982; and
WHEREAS, in order to educate and inspire judicial candidates in Illinois to conduct professional, ethical
campaigns, Mr. Quinlan, beginning in October of 2000, founded and served as Chairman of the Task
Force on Illinois Judicial Elections, a statewide coalition comprised of leaders of the Illinois Judges
Association, the Illinois State Bar Association, The Chicago Bar Association, the American Judicature
Society, and Alliance Bar Associations.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that President Todd H. Stroger and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby express
profound gratitude to William R. Quinlan for his 20 years of pro bono distinguished service to the people
of Cook County, Illinois, and for his many contributions to the improvement of the Cook County justice
system.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
WHEREAS, On December 9, 2009, Governor Pat Quinn signed into Law SB 1466 (PA 96-0832), which
establishes limits on contributions from individuals and corporations (10 ILCS 5/9-8.5); and
WHEREAS, currently the Ethics Ordinance does not reflect the state law that limits contributions from
individuals and corporations to Cook County elected officials, other than those from individuals and
corporations doing business with the County; and
WHEREAS, when only selective limits are in place, candidates to Cook County office have to rely on
donations made by people of higher financial status, allowing a selective few to financially control the
candidate political committees of elected officials; and
WHEREAS, by selectively restricting contributions, major influence on policy and votes will come from
a selective few privileged individuals; a dangerous path towards very specific ideologies and convictions
being thrust upon governmental officials without the best interest of the majority of Cook County
residents in mind; and
WHEREAS, individual contributions over $5,000.00 can greatly influence elected official’s decisions.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
2 Administration, Article VII Ethics, Division 2 Code of Ethical Conduct, Subdivision II Code of Ethical
Conduct, Section 2-585 of the Cook County Code of Ordinances is hereby amended as follows:

year of his or her term.

(3)

To any local, state, or federal campaign committee that is controlled by, or
established in support of, a candidate for County office or an elected County
official.

The combined effect of these provisions is intended to permit total contribution up to, but not exceeding,
$1,500.00 in a year in which a candidacy occurs. A year, for purposes of this section, is from January 1 to
December 31 of each year.

(b)
No single natural person shall make contributions in an aggregate amount exceeding

parent company or otherwise affiliated companies, and any of their employees, officers, directors and
partners who make a political contribution for which they are reimbursed by the entity or its affiliates

an employee, officer, director or partner from making a political contribution up to the maximum
aggregate amount allowed under Subsection (b), for which he is not reimbursed by a person with whom
he or she is affiliated, even if that person has made the maximum contribution allowed under Subsection
(a) of this section.

matters, and property tax incentives in any 12 consecutive months during the previous four years.
(e f)
To the extent that the Zoning Board, Zoning Administrator, Board of Review and County
Assessor may be covered by the provisions herein each shall provide notice of the ethics disclosure
requirements as set forth above. The notice should include a statement that any attorney or tax
representative who has done business with any of these agencies in any 12 consecutive months during the
previous four years as result, must adhere to the campaign contribution limitations set forth by the Cook
County Ethics Ordinance. The Zoning Board, Zoning Administrator, Board of Review and County
Assessor shall provide a list to the Board of Ethics, updated quarterly, of attorneys, law firms, and tax
representatives filing appeals at their office.
The Board of Ethics shall adopt such rules and regulations as necessary to implement this section.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
WHEREAS, recently members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners have called into question
the use of Cook County’s wireless network during Board and Committee meetings for political purposes;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Ethics was queried on said matter, specifically pertaining to an
incident that occurred on Tuesday, November 17, 2009 during the County Board meeting where a
political message was sent from the floor of the Board Room during the meeting using the Twitter
website; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Ethics opined on this matter and concluded that the use of the County’s
wireless internet for said purpose may be construed as a prohibited political activity and a misuse of
County owned property under Sections 2-571 and 2-576 of the Cook County Ethics Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the Ethics Board also recommended that said use be discontinued in the future; and
WHEREAS, presently Article III, Division 2 concerning Rules of Organization does not address the
issue of using social networking sites and electronic communication devices during deliberations of the
County Board; and
WHEREAS, because the absence of any guidelines or policies pertaining to this matter may undermine
transparency and the public confidence in Cook County government, the Board of Ethics also
recommended that the use of social networking sites and other like electronic communications should be
addressed in the framework of the Rules & Administration Committee; and
WHEREAS, Article III, Division 2, Section 2-108, (g) (2) states: The Board may grant members of the
public leave to speak on items pending before the Board; and
WHEREAS, Article III, Division 2, Section 2-108 (i) Floor Privileges states:

*Referred to the Committee on Rules & Administration on 1/12/10.

Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Ordinance
Amendment (Communication No. 304531) be approved.
Chairman Moreno stated that the above Proposed Ordinance Amendment was drafted in early January
2010 due to a letter Commissioner Sims had received from the Ethics Board; a copy of that letter dated
December 23, 2009, has been distributed to all the Commissioners. The letter stated that the
Commissioners should revisit the Cook County Code and perhaps amend the rules. The amendments to
the rules were submitted to the State’s Attorney’s Office for their review. The State’s Attorney gave the
Board a lengthy opinion after much research and deliberation and found that it does not impact the first
amendment.
Chairman Moreno asked Patrick Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, to
address the Commissioners.
Mr. Driscoll stated that the State’s Attorney’s Office looked at the issue and found that there are no cases
directly in point, but in the analysis the State’s Attorney’s Office does not believe that there is a legal
impediment. The State’s Attorney does not have a legal opinion on whether it should be adopted or not;
that is not the State’s Attorney’s role.
Commissioner Suffredin asked for a roll call when time is appropriate.
Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Ordinance
Amendment (Communication No. 304531) be approved. Commissioner Suffredin called for a Roll
Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 28, 2010 from
MATTHEW B. DeLEON, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $55,200.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for the replacement of the existing media library on the Secretary to the Board of
Commissioners website and to pay outstanding invoices for the previous vendor which provided that
service.
Reason:

Since 2007, the Office of the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners made significant
changes to its internet presence in order to provide greater transparency and a wider array of
information for residents of Cook County and County staff. One aspect of this effort was the
addition of a media library which contained audio and video recordings of Board
proceedings. In reviewing the web presence of jurisdictions similar to ours, we determined
that our current library could be improved upon substantially in terms of ease of use and
faster access to information. This transfer will allow the Office to substantially upgrade and
improve upon the existing service and to complete our obligations with the current vendor
and provide the preliminary elements for live streaming video and audio of County Board
proceedings.

1.

Cable Casting

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
June 28, 2010. On May 29, 2010, the balance in the account was $60,100.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
For all accounts used as the source of transfer funds, an effort was made throughout the year to
meet all obligations and provide all services while identifying cost effective methods of doing so.
Once the office was comfortable that all obligations would be met for this fiscal year, the office
sought to find new ways of improving on existing services by reprogramming remaining funds.
These accounts represent all accounts available to the office for purposes of transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from the following:
018-225 Postage: None
018-240 Printing and Publishing: None
018-260 Professional and Managerial Services: None
018-353 Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services: Canceled subscriptions to
publications which were available online.
018-397 Office Expense - Secretary to the Board of Commissioners: Deferred office supply
purchases after determining that existing supplies would meet current year demand.
018-441 Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing Equipment and Software: Determined that
existing equipment was in good order and could defer any maintenance or repair beyond
the last two months of this fiscal year.
018-579 Computer Equipment: None
018-880 Institutional Memberships & Fees: Invoices for organizations to which the County
belongs were slightly less than anticipated.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

93

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
For the three accounts listed below, an attempt was made to identify cost savings throughout the
year which would result in a reduced reliance on the original appropriation.
018-225 Postage: Made greater use of alternate methods of delivery for notices, agendas
and correspondence where possible.
018-240 Printing and Publishing: Made greater use of in-house printing and publishing methods.
018-260 Professional and Managerial Services: Obtained administrative rights over the "Jackets"
Committee Communication system from the Clerk of the Board, requiring less reliance
on external consultants to make programming changes.
_________________________
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the transfer of funds be
approved. The motion carried unanimously.

DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES
FY 2011 BUDGET DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 27, 2010 from
95

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010

TAKASHI REINBOLD, Director, Department of Budget and Management Services
Re:

Reductions Guidance Memorandum

submitting the letter to the bureaus and departments which provided the guidelines for development of
their Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Requests to the Department of Budget and Management Services.
LETTER
September 27, 2010
Cook County Commissioners, Elected Officials and Department Heads,
FY 2011 BUDGET DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
As we are preparing to receive your requests of funding for FY 2011, we wanted an opportunity to
discuss issues that will have an impact on the development of your FY 2011 budget.
Amendment 10S, which was adopted during passage of the FY 2010 Budget increased the budgetary hold
back of departments to accommodate the anticipated $32 million of lost Sales Tax Revenue. The rollback
of .5%, which went into effect July 1, 2010, reduced the Sales Tax Rate from 1.75% to 1.25%. The actual
revenue effect of this rollback will first be experienced in the final two months (October and November)
of FY 2010.
The Bureau of Finance’s First Pass Plan (6/30/2010) for FY 2011 Revenues anticipated a year over year,
2010 to 2011, revenue decline in the General Fund of approximately $311 million. The revised revenue
plan for 2011 is now forecasting a decline of $317 million. Additionally, we expect previously approved
wage increases and fringe benefits to add another $35 million to the 2011 expenditures.
This revenue estimate will require process changes and new planning strategies in order to continue
current levels of service to citizens. Many of you will recall the $502 million projected deficit in 2007.
We were able to remedy that situation with increasing revenues and expenditure reductions. The
difference between then and now is that in 2007 the economy was not in the throes of a deep recession.
What makes this time more troublesome is that there is no foreseeable sign of meaningful relief. The
current revenue plan reflects continued challenging economic conditions affecting housing, employment
and consumption. Based on the estimated revenues for next year, our current level of expenditures cannot
be sustained.
We must look differently at how we develop the FY 2011 budget. Traditional approach would start with
the 2010 budget then raise or lower appropriations based on existing expectations of spending for
operations. Strategies in developing the FY 2011 budget will have to include alternative ways of using
resources. We must be cognizant of and prioritize our primary core functions. Then we must craft a more
flexible budget, one that gives us leeway to decide how best to utilize available resources. With this as a
guiding principle we establish the following budget development guidelines:
a. Budget expectation is 11 % pro rata reduction from the 2010 Adopted Budget with the exceptions
noted below.
Line items excluded from the above calculation: 260 – Professional Services, 298 –
Special Programs, 818 – Reimbursement to Designated Funds.
96

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010

a. 260 – Professional Services. Our expectation is to reduce this
account by 35%. The reductions will not be pro rata. Any
Professional Services must be justified in detail. All requests will
be reviewed and approved subject to available funding.
b. Use of the Fixed Charges 490, 499 and 899 lines will no longer be available for departments. The
use of the Fixed Charges Departments is for expenditures that are not directly attributable to the
function or purpose of a specific department. By placing department specific costs in 490, 499,
or 899 a distorted view of the actual cost of providing a service or function of the department is
presented. We are reviewing all charges to these departments to determine the appropriateness of
the current funding location. We will transfer 90% of 2010 adopted appropriation to the
appropriate control department. When preparing your FY 2011 request, please identify each item
previously budgeted in 490, 499 or 899 as such.
c. Countywide contracts must be funded through each using department’s line items. This will
ensure that the contract is properly funded with required amounts. Any questions regarding the
amounts for your department should be directed to the department responsible for the countywide
contract. Underfunding will require a transfer of funds to accommodate the cost of the contracted
obligation.
Departments responsible for the initiating, monitoring and payment of countywide
contracts are to ensure that the Department of Budget and Management Services is aware
of all departments using the contract and amounts to be appropriated to each department.
d. Requests for new or increased capital funding must provide an analysis outlining the benefit of
such a request; improvement to current work processes, service level or additional revenue.
In 2009 and 2010 we funded a number of capital projects and capital equipment requests for a
total of $689.3 million. Any type of capital project that may require ongoing funding for
operations by using future general funds must be evaluated before new or additional funding is
requested.
Please budget capital leasing options in operating accounts and not in the Capital Equipment
Funding Request of the Budget Request application.
e. Define the core purpose of your department. Describe how your department serves public
interest. Please use this template for submitting your mission statement.
Mission Statement Template
We exist to: (primary purpose, need served or problem solved)
For: (primary customer, user)
In order to: (core services offered)
So that: (long-term outcomes determining success)
We continue to review operations for revenue and cost saving strategies and it is important to recognize
that these directives do not address the total amount of the void created from the decline in future
revenues coupled with anticipated increased expenses. Any suggestions that you may have that can help
in developing strategies for the long term sustainability of Cook County operations will be welcomed.

The Wackenhut Corporation provides security services to ensure the safety and security
of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center residents and staff members while the JTDC
implements its hiring plan that was approved by the Federal Courts on June 23, 2010.
The court approved hiring plan abolishes the Juvenile Detention Counselor (JDC)
position and replaces the JDC position with a Youth Development Specialist (YDS)
position which requires a bachelors degree in the social science field. The educational
requirement meets the minimum eligibility requirements established for detention center
line staff from the Administrative Offices of the Illinois Courts (AOIC). Additionally, all
direct care staff hired prior to June 2008 will have to take the IMPACT test which is the
nationally recognized test for detention direct care staff. This staffing plan potentially
impacts at least 180 JTDC employees. Also, the JTDC continues to experience
unexpected terminations, resignations, and new eligibility requirements, causing
fluctuations in the needs for the JTDC staff coverage. The expiration date of the current
contract is November 30, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $5,000,000.00. Contract extension: December 1, 2010 through November 30,
2011. (440-260 Account).

OFFICE OF THE RECORDER OF DEEDS
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 26, 2010 from
127

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010

EUGENE "GENE" MOORE, Cook County Recorder of Deeds
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ACS Government Records
Management, Dallas, Texas, for a software support system.
Reason:

ACS Government Records Management is the only vendor that owns the software for the
Cook County Recorder of Deeds (CCRD) 20/20 perfect vision system and this company is
currently performing the software support system work for the CCRD office. ACS 20/20
perfect vision will provide application software support and services for the 20/20 Perfect
Vision System for the Cashiering System, Real-Estate Indexing System and Database System.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $85,000.00. Contract period: September 1, 2010 through August 31, 2011.
(527-579 Account). Requisition No. 05270028.
Sufficient funds are available in the Document Storage System Fund.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.
_________________________
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be
authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE
CONTRACT AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 29, 2010 from
ZAHRA ALI, Director of Revenue
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to include the Department of Revenue of Cook County
and amend Contract No. 05-43-197 awarded by the Cook County Board on September 21, 2004 and
subsequently renewed on April 9, 2008 with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., Chicago, Illinois
through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to provide lockbox services. The contract shall be
amended to reflect virtual remote deposit services and online e-payments acceptance for Bureau of
Administration agencies, Office of the Sheriff, Real Estate Management, Bureau of Finance, Bureau of
Technology, Department of Administrative Hearings and various County Ordinances which require the
Department of Revenue to collect payments.
Reason:

This request will provide acceleration and efficiency of the revenue collection process,
which is critical to meet both goals of following best practices and meeting industry
standards for Cook County. Lockbox service and e-payment solutions will expedite the
collection of the current paper-based payments. Currently, Cook County Department of
Revenue personnel manually process 100,000 transactions in-house. Furthermore,
lockbox service and e-payment solutions will provide a cost savings to the Cook County
Department of Revenue. Additional benefits include better payment and posting
accuracy, improve cash flow by reducing processing time, image retrieval and archiving,
128

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
provide an option for electronic connectivity for taxpayers and re-assign current
compliance resources to their designated job functions.
Funding for the lockbox is achieved through both a cost and interest accrued.
Compensating balances and the amount the County will pay has an inverse relationship.
While interest rates are at a historic low, the County will have a payment obligation,
however, when the interest market is reinvigorated and rates begin to climb, the actual
charge to the County will decrease. Based on historical analysis, it is believed that
compensating balances will fund the entire expense of this operation over time.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: Total contract cost is approximately $162,000 funded through both
compensating balances and a line item allocation. The net cost to the County will not exceed $83,000 for
FY 2011 and FY 2012. Contract period: October 5, 2010 through January 31, 2013. (007-244
Account). Requisition No. 0070015.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012 funds.
_________________________
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(1) Amendment or suspension of rules,
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to suspend Section 2-108(h)(1) Prior
notice to public; agendas. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the County Purchasing Agent
be authorized to amend the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Daley voted "present".

OFFICE OF THE STATE'S ATTORNEY
GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 10, 2010, from
KELLY CASSIDY, Director of Programs and Development Unit, State’s Attorney’s Office
requesting authorization to accept a grant in the amount of $373,500.00 from the Illinois Criminal Justice
Information Authority. Funding for the Complex Drug Prosecution Initiative was reduced for the
upcoming program year. Through the use of these American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funds
(ARRA), this grant will provide funding that will allow the Complex Drug Prosecution Initiative to be
work at full capacity. This program funds the salaries of three (3) assistant state’s attorneys and one (1)
investigator. The Complex Drug Prosecutions Initiative focuses on implementing strategies that have
proven to be effective in combating drug enterprises and networks operating in the city and suburban
Cook County. There is no required match for the funding, however there is cash match that supports the
costs of the fringe benefits of the four (4) grant funded personnel and the independent audit. The
overmatch is necessary as it eliminates any issue with supplanting as in previous funding years for the
Initiative the cost of fringe benefits was supported by a cash match.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $103,239.00 (Over Match) (250-818 Account). Grant Award: $373,500.00.
Funding Period: October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.

GRANT AWARD RENEWAL
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 27, 2010, from
MICHELE V. LATZ, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State’s Attorney’s Office
132

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2010
requesting authorization to accept a grant renewal in the amount of $271,238.00 from the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority. This grant provides funding for the DNA Training and
Prosecution Program. The DNA Training and Prosecution Program provides training, support and
assistance to assistant state’s attorneys in cases involving DNA evidence. The program works to best
utilize limited DNA testing resources by being an internal resource for other bureaus of the office for the
purpose of teaching and consulting on how to make better use of DNA evidence and expedite cases. In
addition, the program helps to prepare all assistant state’s attorneys for the continued growth and
importance that DNA technology has to law enforcement. In addition, the program investigates and
prosecutes some complex cases that involve DNA evidence. The DNA Training and Prosecution
Program dedicates one assistant state’s attorney, one DNA Resource Specialist, and one investigator to
the Criminal Prosecutions Bureau of the State’s Attorney’s Office. This grant requires that our office
match one dollar for each three dollars of federal funding. A cash match from the Capital Litigation Fund
that partially supports the salary and fringe benefits of the grant-funded assistant state’s attorney and one
investigator fulfills the match commitment for this program.
The authorization to accept the previous grant was given on November 4, 2009 by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners in the amount of $271,238.00 with no fiscal impact.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $271,238.00. Funding Period: October 1, 2010 through

Requesting authorization to accept a grant renewal in the amount of $800,604.00 from the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority. This grant provides continued and combined funding for our
Complex Drug Prosecutions Initiative. This program funds the salaries of seven (7) assistant state’s
attorneys and three (3) investigators. The Complex Drug Prosecutions Initiative focuses on implementing
strategies that have proven to be effective in combating drug enterprises and networks operating in the
city and suburban Cook County. This grant requires that our Office match one dollar for every three
dollars of federal funding. The match commitment for this program is a cash match and covers a portion
of the salaries, all of the grant-funded personnel fringe benefits and the independent audit.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Source accounts were identified by surplus amounts and the estimated expenditures for the
remainder of the year in those accounts.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There will not be any projects, purchases, programs, contracts or other obligations that will be
deferred, delayed, or cancelled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
A decision to reduce training costs and subsequent travel costs was made after the budget was
approved to ensure sufficient funding for critical areas in the Zoning Board's budget. It is believed
that the balances remaining in: Training Programs for Staff Personnel 170-186, Books, Periodicals,
Publications, Archives and Data Services 170-353, Computer Operations Supplies 170-388 and
Printing and Publishing 170-240 will be adequate through the remaining fiscal year.
