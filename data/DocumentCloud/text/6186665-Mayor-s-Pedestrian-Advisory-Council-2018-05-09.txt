Vision Zero Update

 



 
 
   

Non-Governmental
MPAC Member
Collaborative Project

 

Process


CDOT staff, consultants, and Adam generated list of potential communityled strategies that would advance priorities across multiple pedestrian- and
active transportation-focused plans



MPAC members identified three priorities they could endorse


Non-Governmental Members: strategies they could commit to



Governmental Members: strategies they endorsed



At February 2018 MPAC meeting groups shared their priorities



April 23rd meeting of non-governmental MPAC members


CLOCC, Lurie Children’s IPRC, Active Transportation Alliance, AARP



Focused on strategies our four organizations could commit to

 Goals


To raise awareness about pedestrian safety



To increase visibility of Vision Zero and similar strategies



To support neighborhood engagement in Vision Zero



To focus efforts in Vision Zero High Crash Areas/Corridors



Supplement with city-wide emergency room data on crash-related serious
injury

 Strategy: Support walkability initiatives
at the neighborhood level


Including collaboration on grant proposals to bring such efforts to scale



Being tool “agnostic” but prioritizing tools that are already in use in
Chicago


Using CLOCCs Neighborhood Walkability Initiative



Using AARP’s walkability audit



Using other tools as appropriate to community and audience

 Strategy: Conduct data dissemination about
crashes, injuries, and fatalities


Including data now available to Lurie Children's Hospital



Working with CDOT and other partners on crash/fatality data analysis and
plans to share



Share trends, comparisons to national data, specific incidences by area,
etc. in priority areas and with priority constituencies


E.g., elected officials, media, community-based organizations, active
transportation activists

 Strategy: Build grassroots support for
legislation and funding


Focus at all levels: local, state, and federal legislation



Work with government and non-governmental agencies to understand
funding streams, current levels, and identify opportunities for expansion



Advocate for legislative priorities



Link legislative priorities to walkability initiatives


engage communities in policy development



educate communities about policy approaches and priorities



grassroots lobbying activities (for those organizations that can)

 Discussion


Reflections on these ideas



How can your agencies contribute?



Currently limited by organizational capacity and resources:




Ideas for funding and partnering?

Coordination of efforts


future meetings of non-governmental partners?



Use of future MPAC meetings?



Other ways to connect and advance?

 Chinatown Walkability
Project

Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community
for Mayor’s Pedestrian Advisory Council - May 9, 2018

 Chinatown Community Vision Plan
● Partnership with 25th Ward
Alderman Solis and Chicago
Metropolitan Agency for
Planning (CMAP) LTA
● Centennial celebration in 2013
● 2000 people provided input through
postcards, surveys: focus groups,
intercept, 2 townhalls
● Plan was completed in 2015
● 5 implementation committees have
been formed

 Area of Study: Chinatown/Greater Chinatown

Chinatown Walkability Project
● Aging population (aging-in-place)
● Generation gap in bicycling
(Chicago Reader)
● Public has urban planners
● Neighborhood taking control of its
own destiny
● Applied and received funding by
Healthy Chicago 2.0 grant (PHIMC
and Chicago Department of Public
Health)

 Data Collection
● CLOCC Neighborhood Walkability Assessment Tool (NWAT) - 46 volunteers
○
○

34 intersections and 51 blocks were audited at three different time points (weekday morning,
weekday evening, weekend)
Sidewalk conditions, motorist and pedestrian behaviors, signage, perception of violence,
neighborhood aesthetics and nearby amenities

● Focus Groups/Charrettes
○
○

Open-ended questions about walking and biking destinations, safety challenges, and
recommended amenities
100 community members participated
■ High School Students
■ College Students/Young Adults
■ Seniors
■ ESL Students
■ General Public

 Key Findings
● Walking (Chinatown Square, Wentworth Corridor, Chinese American Service
League, Library as major destinations
○

Amenities to be considered: clean streets (26%), better lighting (19%), public seating
(16%), more police (14%), improved sidewalks (11%)

● Biking (Chinatown Square, Wentworth Corridor, Chinatown Library, groceries,
work as destinations)
○

Amenities to be considered: dedicated bike lanes (29%), bike parking (16%), protected
bike lanes (7%), clean and even streets (6%), improved crosswalks (6%)

● Safety (least safe in viaducts, alleyways, problematic intersections, sidewalk
and road conditions)
○

Amenities to be considered: improved lighting (18%), more police (15%), improved
sidewalks (13%), regulated traffic (10%), improved viaducts (6%)

 Key Findings Con’t
● Challenges to accessibility: narrow sidewalks, poorly maintained sidewalks,
damaged or missing curb cuts/ramps, missing sidewalks, pathways
obstructions, litter
● Challenges to safety: speeding traffic, misaligned/obstructed pedestrian
lights, missing stop signs, inadequate pedestrian count lighting, pedestrian
count timing, viaducts in poor conditions, missing countdown timers, cars not
yielding to pedestrian
● Challenges to biking: lack of protected bike lanes, bike racks, cyclists on
sidewalks
● Favorable assets for community: countdown timers, curb bump outs, painted
crosswalks, stop signs, shops/restaurants, CTA, benches, home gardens,
landscaping, signage, parks, library, shade from trees, more people

 Recommendations Examples
● Infrastructure improvements: ADA compliant curb ramps; repair cracked or
uneven segments of sidewalks, audible pedestrian signals; restripe and
maintain crosswalks; protected bike lanes; bicycle parking; public art
● Amenities improvements: lighting under viaducts; pedestrian counts; lighting
on residential streets; trash cans along business corridors; public seating and
bus shelters
● Educational campaigns: bilingual promotion of obeying traffic rules and
regulations; bilingual promotion of benefits of active transportation
● Other: traffic study on Archer-Cermak-Princeton; placemaking

 Implementation
● Some changes were made by Alderman Solis during the
study period
● Changes will be made in coming years as part of the WellsWentworth realignment project + river improvements
● Placemaking as a strategy for improved sense of community and safety (held
two events - Chinatown is Beautiful, Festival of Trees)
● Encourage local elementary schools (and high school) to run education on
cycling/connect schools to resources
● Signage plan + Chinatown SSA in future (future of parking lots?)
● Serve as a resource for other communities looking to work on neighborhood
planning and/or walkability
● Read the full plan at cbcacchicago.org!
