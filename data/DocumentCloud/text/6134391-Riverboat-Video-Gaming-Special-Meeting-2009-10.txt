CHAIRMAN’S REPORT/COMMENTS –
Today we are going to deal with Emergency Rules pertaining to video poker.
Our staff and our legal department worked overtime and did a tremendous job in getting these
rules together and I thank them for their efforts. I always marvel at how willing our staff is to
put in that extra effort and those extra hours when needed.
I must caution you however to the fact that our emergency rules are incomplete because what
was legislated is no way a minor change in the law. What was legislated was the creation of a
new industry – the Video Gaming Industry – which when completed will be the largest video
gaming industry in any state in the union and possibly the world.
This law will require that we install a mammoth main frame computer to monitor thousands of
gaming machines all over the state. This main frame computer will feed to us instant
information on everything that is going on in and with each and every machine. From our
mainframe we should be able to shut down any and all machines that we find fault with.
Because of the law we will be required to issue thousands and thousands of licenses to persons or
companies having contact with those machines. That means thousand and thousands of
background checks.

 We will create an accounting system and an auditing system whereby the state will collect their
tax money as soon as possible from each and every machine and location.
The list of things required to be done go on and on and are numerous. Especially since we will
be the largest state having this industry within our borders.
Until we have a handle on all of the bridges that we have to cross we cannot complete the rules
without having holes in our rules and in our regulation. We will not do that.
Our needs for regulating this law have been made known to the powers that be. The longer it
takes to get the funding and the personnel to properly do the job – the longer it will be to
implement this law.
I know that the state is in a terrible financial crisis! Everyone wants the tax money yesterday. I
don’t blame them. The state needs it. But the truth is that there is no money unless you create a
proper system.
You cannot produce a video gaming industry with a snap of the finger.
We are going to do this right. Some have suggested to “cut and paste the rules”. At the IGB, we
do not cut and paste. No short cuts will be taken. We will do this right and we will need to be
funded properly.
ADMINISTRATOR’S COMMENTS –
Staff has been working diligently with the rules, applications and RFP’s. We will continue to
work on these issues. A special meeting will be held November 6, 2009 to hear public
commentary about the rules.
GENERAL COUNSEL COMMENTS –
We are today presenting a partial set of proposed rules. There are a number of areas that are not
covered by the proposed rules, such as advertising, promotional activity, transferring of
ownerships, seizure issues, inspection of locations, technical matters, etc. Those matters are still
on the drawing board. We are anxious to have a testing lab on board.
