Violet was 31 years old when she was diagnosed with Stage
IV Colorectal Cancer. She spent a year trying to convince
doctors something was wrong, only to be told repeatedly
she was “too young” to have this disease.
Currently considered incurable, Violet continues bi-weekly
chemotherapy treatments while sharing her story and
educating herself through building relationships within the
patient community.

Join us to learn more about Violet’s story, early onset
colorectal cancer, and valuable insight from the patient
perspective that all patient navigators and providers should
know. Violet works with patient navigators in her own
treatment and moderates online groups as part of
Colontown, the leading online patient community for
colorectal cancer patients. She also serves on the District of
Columbia (DC) Young Adult Cancer Advisory Board in
collaboration with the Smith Center for Healing and the
Arts, which helps provide programming to young adult
cancer patients in DC and to build relationships and
communities of healing and love.
