PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
COOK COUNTY REAL PROPERTY TRANSFER TAX ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 74, Taxation, Article III, Real Estate Transfer
Tax, Section 74-100 through 74-113of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as Follows:

Page 66 of 73

 Sec. 74-100. Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Cook County Real Property Transfer Tax Ordinance.
Sec. 74-101. Definitions.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Affix (or affixed, affixing) shall mean physically or electronically indicated.
Beneficial interest in real property includes, but is not limited to:
(1) The beneficial interest in an Illinois land trust;
(2) The lessee interest in a ground lease (including any interest of lessee in the related improvements)
that provides for a term of 30 or more years when all options to renew or extend are included, whether or
not any portion of the term has expired; or
Controlling interest means:
(1) Fifty percent or more of the combined voting power or fair market value of all ownership interests or
beneficial interests in a real estate entity, whether the interests are owned by one or by several persons; or
(2) The right of one or of several persons to receive at the time of any distribution 50 percent or more of
the income or profits of a real estate entity.
Real Estate entity means any person (other than an Illinois land trust) including, but not limited to, any
partnership, corporation, limited liability company, trust, single or multi-tiered entity, or any other entity
that exists or acts substantially for the purpose of holding, directly or indirectly, title to or beneficial
interest in real property whether for personal use, the production of rental income, or investment. It shall
be presumed, unless proven otherwise, that an entity is a real estate entity if it owns, directly or indirectly,
real property having a fair market value greater than 75 percent of the total fair market value of all the
entity's assets (determined without deduction for any mortgage, lien or encumbrance).
Recorder or Recorder of Deeds means the County Recorder of Deeds or the County Registrar of Titles.
Tax stamp means a physical, electronic or alternative indicia that indicates the amount of tax paid.
Transfer price means the consideration furnished for the transfer of title to, or beneficial interest in, real
property, valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits and property,
determined without any deduction for mortgages, liens or encumbrances, and specifically including the
amount of any indebtedness or obligation cancelled or discharged in connection with the transfer. In the
case where the controlling interest in a real estate entity is transferred, and the real estate entity holds
assets in addition to title to or beneficial interest in real property located in the city, the term "transfer
price" means only that portion of the consideration attributable to the transfer of such real property or such
beneficial interest.

Page 67 of 73

 Sec. 74-102. Tax imposed.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a tax is imposed upon the privilege of transferring title
to, or beneficial interest in, real property located in the County whether or not the agreement or contract
providing for the transfer is entered into in the County. The tax shall be at the rate of $0.25 per $500.00 of
the transfer price, or fraction thereof, of the real property or the beneficial interest in real property. If,
however, the real estate is transferred subject to a mortgage, the amount of the mortgage remaining
outstanding at the time of transfer shall not be included in the basis of computing the tax.
(b) Every trustee of a land trust holding title to land which is located in the County shall upon the
transfer, conveyance or assignment of any beneficial interest in a land trust so report such transfer,
conveyance or assignment to the Recorder of Deeds in a manner prescribed by the Recorder which shall
show the transfer, conveyance or assignment price of the beneficial interest, transferred, conveyed or
assigned.
(1) The tax imposed by this article is due upon the earlier of the delivery or recording of the deed,
assignment or other instrument of transfer.
(2) In the case of an assignment of a beneficial interest in a trust, delivery shall be deemed to occur when
the trustee receives possession of a valid assignment of the beneficial interest. In the case of other
transfers, delivery shall be deemed to occur when the transferee, or the transferee's representative or agent,
receives or becomes entitled to receive possession of the instrument of transfer.
(d) The primary incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax are on the seller, grantor, assignor
or other transferor; provided however, that if the transferor is exempt from the tax solely by operation of
State law, then the incidence of the tax and obligation to pay the tax shall be upon the transferee.
(e) The tax imposed by this article shall be due whether the transfer of a controlling interest in a real
estate entity is effected affected by one transaction or by a series of related transactions. For purposes of
this subsection, it shall be presumed unless proved otherwise that transactions are related if they occur
within the same 24-month period.
(f) Nothing in this article shall be construed to impose a tax upon any transaction or privilege which,
under the constitutions of the United States or the State of Illinois, may not be made the subject of taxation
by the County.
Sec. 74-103. Tax additional.

The tax imposed by this article is imposed in addition to all other taxes imposed by the State of Illinois or

(a) The Recorder shall may cause to be printed, in such form and quantities and in such denominations as
the Recorder may from time to time determine, adhesive stamps for the purpose of paying the tax imposed
by this article. Tax stamps may also be sold in a manner where they are affixed as an alternative or
electronic indicia. The Recorder also may appoint one or more agents to sell the tax stamps.
(1) The Recorder from time to time may provide for the issuance and exclusive use of tax stamps of a
new design and forbid the use of stamps of any prior design, but only after giving at least 60 days' notice of
the change. The notice shall be published at least three times in one or more daily newspapers of general
circulation in the County during the 60-day period before the change takes effect. After the effective date
of the change, it shall be unlawful for any person to make use of any other than the new issue or design of
stamps to pay the tax imposed by this article.
(2) Any person lawfully in possession of unused tax stamps of a superseded issue or design may, not
later than 90 days after the effective date of the change, surrender the stamps to the Recorder together with
a sworn application setting forth the name and address of the owner and party surrendering the stamps,
how, when and from whom the stamps were acquired and such other information as the Recorder
reasonably may require. If the Recorder determines that the application is in proper order, the Recorder
promptly shall issue, or authorize an agent to issue, replacement stamps of the new issue or design in
exchange for the surrendered stamps.
(c) No person shall sell or expose for sale, traffic in trade, barter or exchange tax stamps issued pursuant

traffic in, trade, barter or exchange any transfer tax stamp for an amount less than the stamp's face value.
(d) In every case where a physical tax stamp is used to pay the tax imposed by this article, the person
affixing the stamp shall write or stamp thereupon the person's name or initials and the date upon which the
stamp is affixed, and further shall cut or perforate the stamp in a substantial manner so that the stamp
cannot be again used; provided, however, that no stamp shall be defaced in such a manner as to prevent its
authenticity and denomination from being determined. In the case of electronically affixed stamps, the
Recorder of Deeds shall ensure that electronic stamps or indicia are affixed and used in a manner that
prevents multiple use or reuse.
Sec. 74-110. Open transactions.
In the case of a transfer where any part of the transfer price is contingent upon the occurrence of a future
event or the attainment of a future level of financial performance, additional tax shall be due at the time
each additional amount of consideration is furnished and shall be paid directly to the Recorder. A
supplemental real estate transfer declaration shall be filed with the Recorder at the time each tax payment
is due.
Sec. 74-111. Penalties.
(a) Any transferor or transferee who fails to file with the Recorder a real property transfer declaration as

the applicable tax and shall be fined an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 or imprisoned for a period not to
