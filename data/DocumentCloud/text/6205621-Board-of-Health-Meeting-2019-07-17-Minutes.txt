 Prevention doesn’t have a lot of pizzazz. If
you prevent something from happening, it’s
a wonderful thing, but it’s hard to measure
and take credit for.

 2017 Definition of PH Innovation
Public health innovation refers to the development of a new process, policy, product or program
that increase quality, impact and efficiency. This definition and the accompanying characteristics
were informed by discussions with leaders in public health and innovation. PHNCI is testing the
definition and characteristics and will refine them based on our learnings and input from the field.
According to our working characteristics, a public health innovation:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Is novel, new, or creative;
Reflects the dynamic state of change inherent in public health transformation;
Occurs by internal or cross-sector collaboration;
Involves co-production of the process, policy, product, or program with partners, stakeholders,
and/or customer;
Has the potential to generate a new or improved means to create value;
Lends itself to adaptation and adoption/replication and diffusion;
Generates real-time information for evaluation and course correction; and
If related to technology, uses open source technology (i.e., the technology is in the public
domain) so as to facilitate adaption and adoption/replication.

 2019 Draft Definition of PH Innovation
Public health innovation refers to the development and/or
implementation of a novel process, policy, product, or program leading to
improvements that impact health and equity.
Tenets of public health innovation include the following:
• It is an iterative process – not an end point – that can be done
incrementally or radically.
• It requires both collaboration (with diverse and relevant team members
and partners) and co-production (with the people with lived
experience who will be affected by the results of the innovation)
• It is an emerging practice that impacts the status quo and creates
value in a way that lends itself to adaptation or replication by others.

 Why Innovate in Public Health?
New public health threats
• Emerging infectious disease
• Opioids
• Chronic diseases
• Climate Change

Better approaches to improving public health
• Health Equity
• Collaborations
• Digital Transformation
• Open Data & Crowdsourcing
Limited Resources
• Insufficient & inconsistent funding (do more with less)

4 Strategies for Learning About Tech for PH
•

Community
o Creating a tech solution the community doesn’t need wastes time & resources.
o Tech innovations should help solve for an unmet need.
o Communities we serve can help ensure whether or not a technology is complementary
to existing solutions, and replace them entirely if necessary.

•

Communities of practice
o A group of people sharing common interests to improve collective learning.
o Opportunity to be exposed to new people and their methods and technologies.

•

Idea challenges
o Hack-a-thon allure of crowdsourcing solutions quickly, but short-term fixes shouldn’t
replace long-term needs when sustaining these technologies is an afterthought.
o Idea challenges - nothing is built, but novel ideas given a space to be heard.

•

Sharing technology code
o Difficult to operationalize technology from a white paper.
o Open source sharing platforms create blueprints with the added power of transparency
and opportunity for peer review.

How Cities Are Using Analytics to Improve Public

From clean water supplies to the polio vaccine, the most effective public health interventions are
typically preventative policies that help stop a crisis before it starts. But predicting the next public
health crisis has historically been a challenge, and even interventions like chlorinating water or

Machine-learned epidemiology: real-time detection of

Machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool for solving complex problems. and its application in public health has
been underutilized. The objective o?Fthis study is to test the ef?cacy of a machine-learned model offoodborne illness detection in a
real-world setting. To this end. we built FINDER. a machine-learned model for real-time detection o?ffoodborne illness using
anonymous and aggregated web seaich and location data. We computed the fraction of people who visited a particular restaurant
and later searrJ'Ied for terms indicative of food poisoning to identify potentially unsafe restaurants. We used this information to
focus restaurant inspections in two cities and demonstrated that FINDER improves the accuracy of health inspections: restaurants
identi?ed by FINDER are 3.I times as likely to be deemed unsafe during the inspection as restaurants identi?ed by existing
methods. Additionally. FINDER enables us to ascertain previously intractable epidemiological information. For example. in 35% of
cases the restaurant potentially causing food poisoning was not the last one visited. which may explain the lower precision of
complaint-based inspections. We found that FINDER is able to reliably identify restaurants that have an active lapse in food safety.
allowing for implementation of corrective actions that would prevent the potential spread of foodborne illness.

tilt!)i Digital Medicine I36: 



In the 1300s, John Snow had to go door to door durin an
epidemic of cholera to uncover its mechanisms of spread. He
recorded where people were getting their drinking water from in
order to pinpoint the source of the outbreak. Here we scale up this
approach using machine learning to detect potential sources of
foodborne Illness in real time. Machine learning has become an
increasingly common arti?cial intelligence tool and can be
particularly useful when applied to the growling ?eld of 
surveillance. Frequently, sunreillance depends upon
patients actively reporting that may signal the
presence of a speci?c disease.22 In recent years, 
surveillance has also begun to include passively collected
information. such as information from social media. which can
also lend insight into potential disease outbreaks.4 ?5 In this study.
we use such observational data to identify Instances of foodborne
illness at scale.

Frequently. In the United States and elsewhere. efforts to
combat disease ouusreaks still rely on gathering data from
clinicians or laboratories and feeding ?us Information hack to a
central repository, where abnormal upticks in prevalence can be
detected.? For instance. when foodborne illnesses occur in the
United States. determining an outbreak is dependent upon either
complaints from large numbers of patients or receipt of
serological data from laboratory tests" These processes can be
slow and cumbersome and often lead to a delayed response.
allowing for further spread of disease": Having the ability to traclt

and respond to outbreaks in real time would be Immensely useful
and potentially lifesaving.

Here we sought to test the ef?cacy of a machine learned model
that uses aggregated and anonymizied Google search and location
data to detect potential sources of foodborne illness in real time.
Our primary goal was to use this model to Identify restaurants
with potentially unsafe health code violations that could
contribute to foodborne Illness spread. with the hypod'resis mat
our model would be able to more accurately identify a restaurant
with serious health code violations than systems currently in
place. We ?nd that such an approach can lead to a greater than
threefold improvement in identifying potentially problematic
venues over current approaches. including a 63% improvement
over an advanced complaint-based system that already utilizes
Tvatter data mining. Our results provide evidence that this type of
tool can be used by health departments today to more rapidly
pinpoint and investigate locations where outbreaks may be
occurring. This model can be expanded by public health
departments to reduce the burden of Ioodbome illness across
the United States. and can also be expanded to assist in
monitoring a variety of od1er diseases globally.

FIN DER machine-learning methodology

Here we Introduce a machine-learned model called FINDER
[Foodbome DEtector in Real time). which detects restau-
rants with elevated of foodborne illness in real time. The
model leverages anonymous aggregated web search and location

ABSTRACT

Lead poisoning is a major public health problem that a?ects
hundreds ol thousands ofchildren in the United States every
year. A common approach to identilying lead hazards is to
test all children for elevated blood lead levels and then in?
vestigate and remediate the homes ol children with elevated
tests. This can prevent exposure to lead of Future residents.
but only alter a child has been poisoned. This paper de-
scribes joint worlc with the Chicago Department of Public
Health in which we build a model that predicts the
risk ol a child to being poisoned so that an intervention can
take place before that happens. Using two decades of blood
lead level tests. home lead inspections. property value as?
sessments. and census data. our model allows inspectors to
prioritize houses on an intractably long list of potential haz?
ards and identify children who are at the highest rislr. This
work has been described by as pioneering in the use
ol machine learning and predictive analytics in public health
and has the potential to have a signi?cant impact on both
health and economic outcomes for communities across the

I. INTRODUCTION

Lead poisoning is a major public health issue. imposing
lifelong health and economic costs on hundreds ol thousands
of children every year in the United States. Although Eu?
ropean states banned lead paint as early as I909 . po-
litical forces and vested business interests delayed ans on
leaded consumer products in the United States until the late
197%; IE. Throughout most ol the 20th century. cars ran
on leaded gas. houses were coated with leaded paint. and
industry emitted leaded waste products directly into the en-
vironment. To this day. lead in paint remains a signi?cant
hazard. In Chicago. almost 90%- of the housing stock was
built belore the ban IE.

Exposure to lead has been found to be associated with
premature birth and early neurological development issues
such as edema. herniation. atrophy. and. white-matter deb
generation . Lead can cause vomiting: convulsions:
paralysis: an-. in igh concentrations. death IE. Elevated
blood lead levels are associated with lower IQs in children.
A retrospective study by hiazumdar ct at shows that. on
average. a 1 pgy'dL increase in blood-lead evel is associated
with a decrease of 1 IQ: point among six?month?olds and '2
points among ll] year olds.

Because ol the permanent damage it can in?ict. lead poi-
soning imposes signi?cant indirect costs on society. Based
on its well-documented effects on IQ: and contributions to
disorders such as ADI-ID. lead poisoning
has been estimated to signi?cantly lower lifetime earnings
for individuals and greatly increase the costs of crime pre-
vention and special-education programs [or the government.
Lead-related child health issues conservatively cost over Salt]
billion annually Cmpletely eliminating lead in the
United States co indirectly save $200 billion dollars per
year ten times more than needed for removal.

Urban Environmental Data Dashboard
Pilot project focused on enhancing urban planning
and emergency response to extreme heat, with local
stakeholders including the Chicago Department of
Public Health, the Office of Emergency
Communications and ComEd.
Urban Environmental Data Dashboard tool
will provide city with historic and real-time
weather and climate information from
ground observations, local sensor
deployments, MODIS and Landsat datasets,
and model-based products such as NASA’s
MERRA-2 reanalysis.

Exposure to dangerously high temperatures
is a significant public health risk that is
increasing with climate change. Recent
research revealed that the frequency.
duration. and intensity of heat waves in 50
large US. cities rose significantly from 1961
to 2010. and today. extreme heat events are
responsible for more annual fatalities in the
U5. than any other form of extreme weather.

Conduct the Urban Heat
Response Pilot Project

The Midwest heat waves of 1995 and 1999
together claimed more than 1.300 lives. with
an estimated 739 in Chicago alone.

During past extreme heat events. Chicago's
ability to respond has been hindered by its
lack of avai lab I data. Present day challenges
persist due to gaps in data. isolated
datasets. and other issues surrounding data
accessibility. The Urban Heat Response
pilot project will bring together a broad
coalition of stakeholders to explore data-
based approaches to mitigate the negative
impacts of extreme heat events. The pilot
will inform and improve decisions on near?
term planning as well as long?term planning
regarding infrastructure and resilience
investments.

Phase I of the pilot will focus on use case
definition. data gathering. and value
definition to generate a detailed framework
for implementation. For example. this
could focus on quantifying the impacts of
specific investments in green roofing on
the reduction of urban heat island effects.
Phase 2 of the pilot will commit to building
a minimum viable product necessary to
drive decision?making regarding future
extreme heat episodes. For instance. this
could entail generating a clear rationale
for the prioritization of additional green
roofing or other investments to ensure risk
is sufficiently mitigated in the most heat-
vulnerable communities.
