GENERAL BACKGROUND

The purpose of this contract is to modernize the building to comply with the high-rise life safety
ordinance, to modernize capital maintenance components, and to perform selective site work,
including sidewalk repairs These activities will enhance accessibility at building entrances and
common areas, upgrade existing life safety features, and add new life safety equipment, such as a
complete ?re alarm system, extend the useful life of the building, increase the value of the
property, and improve the overall quality of the development.

The apartment building is a nine (9) story building containing two hundred twelve (212)
dwelling units. It was completed in 1975, and is located at 1611 South Racine Avenue.
The scope of work for the building includes, but is not limited to:

generator and associated panels, transfer switches, etc.

The Fire Life Safety upgrades are recommended in order to provide systems that are compliant
with the City of Chicago?s recently enacted Life Safety and High Rise Ordinance, and the
Chicago Building Code. This Ordinance requires improvements to this and other buildings by the
end of 2014. The designs include elements which will achieve this goal. Other improvements
are needed to provide greater ADA accessibility. The existing emergency generator has proven
to be unreliable and requires replacement for the safety of the residents. And general Capital

value.
