 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Maintenance Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids for general contractors to perform capital maintenance work at Harry J. Schneider
Apartments (IL2-081). The work will include, but not be limited to, the replacement of HVAC
equipment located on the roof.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 0595 on September 2, 2010 for capital
maintenance work needed at Harry J. Schneider Apartments (IL2-081). This is a Senior Housing
development built in 1978 at 1750 W. Peterson Ave. on the north side of Chicago. The IFB was
advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, El Dia, on the CHA website and on
BuySpeed Online.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with representatives of All
Chicago, Inc. (All Chicago), the apparent low bidder. The firm responded to questions on the
thoroughness of its bid, the amount of the work it planned to self-perform, its capacity to perform
this work, and the length of time it will take to get the replacement equipment manufactured. Its
representatives assured the CHA that they have the resources to dedicate supervisory personnel
exclusively to this project.
Based on its submitted bid and its responses at the pre-award survey meeting, the Department of
Procurement and Contracts has determined that All Chicago, Inc. is the lowest responsive and
responsible bidder at $148,000.00.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with All Chicago, Inc.
in the amount of $148,000.00 for the replacement of rooftop equipment at Harry J. Schneider
Apartments (IL2-081), 1750 W. Peterson Ave., Chicago, IL. The work is to be completed by no
later than sixty (60) calendar days from the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section
3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
The photos clearly show the (2) air handling units which are to be replaced. These units are
original and have outlived their useful life. They are both to be replaced as part of this scope.
