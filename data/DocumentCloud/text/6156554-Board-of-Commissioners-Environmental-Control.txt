Executive Summary

As required by Cook County Resolution adopted by the Board of Commissioners
regarding the Bottled Water Ban, Facilities Management, Purchasing, and the Bureau of
Administration Industrial Engineers conducted a Countywide survey of all departments to assess
their current water usage, availability of fresh tap water, feasibility and cost of installing water
puri?cation systems, and the ?nancial, logistical, and operational impact on County
Departments. The study also included analyzing the viability of switching all bottled water
dispensers to bottle-less water dispensers including the associated costs and the viability of
turning on all currently disconnected drinking water fountains. All County departments
reSponded to the survey. The major ?ndings are as follows:

There are a total of 1,792 ownedfleased drinking water systems (1,210 bottled water
systems, 30 bottle-less water puri?cation systems, 552 drinking fountains) County wide
over 60 different facilities. Because the County does not own and/or operate all these
facilities, there are a portion of bottled water systems which will be very dif?cult to
replace.

Of the. 1,210 bottled water systems, 1,088 are owned and 122 are leased.

The County currently spends an average of $380,320 annually on drinking water systems
and bottled water re?lls. This total includes lease costs, bottled water re?lls, and ?lters.
The average annual cost for bottled water re?lls is $290 and lease cost is $237.

The Bureau of Health only has a total of 14 bottled water coolers. The BOH Chief
Financial Of?cer and former Chief Operating Of?cer eliminated all bottled water coolers
where possible over the past year which reduced their annual bottled water cost by an
estimated $172,969.

The top ?ve departments by number of bottled water coolers and annual cost are the
Sheriff?s Of?ce (178 coolers, $145,757), Chief Judge (460 coolers, $81,289), Clerk of the
Court (127 coolers, $26,752), State?s Attorney (77 coolers, $21,408), and Adult Probation
(55 coolers, $10,566). These ?ve of?ces account for 76% of the County?s total drinking
water coolers and costs.

Facilities Management determined that of the 443 drinking fountains surveyed over 27
facilities, 397 currently operate properly. However, these systems are not being
utilized by employees due to a perception that the water is not acceptable to drink.

Facilities Management had the quality of the water tested in twelve County facilities
including the County Building, 69 W. Washington, Forensic Institute, ?ve suburban
courthouses, Domestic Violence Courthouse, Hawthorne Warehouse, Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center, and uvenile Court and determined that the water met all EPA

standards and is acceptable to drink.

- Installation of bottle-less water systems is more costly than originally anticipated due to
County requirements which requires the use of union plumbers which are paid
considerably more than the vendor?s non-union installers. Additionally, building code
requires the use of copper or stainless steel piping, not plastic tubing which is typically
used by the vendors and less expensive.

Replacemegt Alternatives and Associated Costs
Three alternative options and their associative costs have been developed to address the
elimination of bottled water coolers and are as follows:

Option I is to replace all existing bottled water coolers with bottle-less systems in facilities
which are owned and operated by the County. In order to replace the 334 units in the Daley
Center, the County would need to work with the Public Building Commission to have the project
funded and approved. If all 1,210 bottled water coolers were replaced, the estimated initial
capital cost is $2,057,000, with a ?ve year estimated cost of $2,783,000 which includes
maintenance, annual replacement of ?lters, and disposal of existing coolers. This option would
eliminate the estimated $380,320 annual cost of bottled water. This option would have a
payback in approximately 8.4 years.

Option 11 is a phased replacement of the bottled water coolers. Phase I would have bottle-less
water coolers installed on a building by building basis, in all locations near an existing water
source and require departments to eliminate all their bottled water coolers. All departments
would have access to at least one water cooler. Exceptions would be made to keep bottled water
coolers in locations that have public health concerns and do not have a water source in close
proximity. Phase II would be to assess the needs of each facility and department for additional
bottle?less water systems that are necessary for logistical or public health reasons. Once an
assessment is completed, additional bottle-less water systems could be installed. This Option
will spread the cost of the these replacements over a period of several years and immediately
reduce the number of water cooler systems County wide. Assuming half of the bottled water
coolers are replaced, the estimated initial capital cost is $1,028,500, with a total ?ve year
estimated cost of $1,391,500. This option would have a payback in approximately 3.4 years.

Option is to install building wide ?ltration systems in County owned facilities and is the
most costly of the three options. This system would ?lter, purify, and store water in a large tank
and distribute throughout the building either through existing or new pipe. The estimated capital
cost of a building wide ?ltration system and tank varies greatly and is dependant on many factors
including incoming water quality, daily usage, and physical building characteristics and costs
between $20,000 and $160,000. This estimated cost includes the capital cost of the system
equipment, however, does not include the costs of system installation, new or additional required
plumbing, individual dispensers/fountains, or system maintenance, all of which could be very
costly. If drinking water was not separately plumbed ?'om hygienic or operational usage 
toilets, chillers/boilers, landscaping, etc.) a larger system would be required. Even though a
dedicated drinking water system would require a smaller system, a large amount of new
plumbing would need to be installed.

Introduction

As required by the Board of Commissioners through the adoption of Resolution (see
Appendix) on November 6, 2007, Facilities Management, Purchasing and the Bureau of
Administration Industrial Engineers have been working together to assess current water usage
and determine the viability of switching to bottle-less water dispensers.

The resolution states:

the Purchasing Agent and the Bureau of Administration shall, within 90
days of passage, work with all County departments to conduct a water audit to
assess their current water usage, availability of fresh tap water, and the feasibility
and cost of installing water puri?cation systems; such audit shall
determine the viability of switching all bottled water dispensers to bottle-less
water dispensers; such audit shall also determine the viability of turning
on all currently disconnected drinking water 

Resolution 07-R-436 was later suspended by resolution (see Appendix), passed on
February 20, 2008 to ?allow greater due diligence and proper audit and assessment of ?nancial,
logistical, and operational impact of the Cook County Bottled Water Ban.? The resolution also
states that ?the Bureau of Administration shall present their ?ndings no later than July 1, 2008.?

Methodology

The methodology for this audit included the deve10pment of a Drinking Water Survey (see
Appendix) and the gathering of water system, usage, and cost data from all County departments.
Surveys were prepared electronically by all departments and submitted through email. The
survey responses were entered into a database and analyzed regarding their current water usage
as well as the number, location, type and cost of current purchased/leased water systems was
performed. The study also included the analysis of expenditure data provided by the
Comptroller?s Of?ce, and analysis of the costs and feasability associated with the installation and
operation of bottle-less water systems based on information provided by Facilities Management
and bottle?less water system vendors.

Facilities Management performed a survey of drinking fountains in 24 County owned facilities
and determined whether or not the fountains worked properly. This survey captured the drinking
fountains which were not speci?cally used by a departments and were primarily located in public

are as .

Findings

Drinking Water Survey
The Drinking Water Survey (see Appendix) was developed and sent to all County departments to

determine the number and types of drinking water systems, locations, water usage, costs, and
other information. The results of this survey are summarized in Tables 1-3 as seen on pages 7-9.

Table 1 shows the quantity and type of drinking water systems by department, Table 2 shows the
quantity/type of systems by building/location, and Table 3 shows drinking water expenditures by
department for FY2005 through FY2007.

The major ?ndings of this survey are as follows:

The County currently owns/leases 1,792 drinking water systems throughout 60 facilities,
with associated average annual costs of $380,320.

Table 1 shows that of the current 1,792 drinking water systems, there are 1,210 bottled
water systems (1,088 owned, 122 leased), 30 water puri?cation systems (28 owned, 2
leased), and 552 drinking fountains. These systems are installed in 60 different facilities
occupied by County agencies.

The Chief Judge?s Of?ce has the largest number of bottled water coolers with 460, or
38% of the County?s total of 1,210. These are primarily located in the chambers, ante
chambers, jury rooms, and court rooms. Many of the judges chambers currently have
plumbing. The department with the second largest bottled water cooler inventory is the
Sheriff?s Of?ce with 178, or 14.7%. This total includes all sections of the Sheriff?s
Of?ce including the Department of Corrections.

The top ?ve departments by number of bottled water coolers and annual cost are the
Sheriff? Of?ce (178 coolers, $145,757), Chief Judge (460 coolers, $81,289), Clerk of the
Court (127 coolers, $26,752), State?s Attorney (77 coolers, $21,408), and Adult Probation
(55 coolers, $10,566). These ?ve of?ces account for 76% of the County?s total drinking
water coolers and costs.

The Bureau of Health only has a total of 14 bottled water coolers: Oak Forest (9),
Cermak (4), and Ambulatory (1). The BOH Chief Financial Of?cer and former Chief
Operating Of?cer eliminated all bottled water coolers where possible over the past year
which reduced their bottled water cost by $172,969. The County?s estimated annual cost,
in turn, has been reduced from $553,289 to $380,320. The Bureau of Health currently
utilizes a 144 drinking fountains and 26 bottle-less coolers throughout their facilities.

The Daley Center has the largest number of bottled water coolers with 334, or 27.6% of
the County?s total of 1,210. 

90% of the COunty?s bottled water coolers are located in 18 of the 60 facilities surveyed.
90% of the County?s bottled water coolers are used 14 of the '55 departments surveyed.

The average annual cost for bottled water re?lls per cooler is $290. The average annual
lease cost for the County?s 122 leased bottled water coolers is $23 7, not including water.

Of the existing 1,210 water cooler systems, only 67 responses noted that the system is
within 50 feet of existing plumbing to install a water puri?cation system. This low
percentage was con?rmed by a by Facilities Management of the Bridgeview
Courthouse in which there are limited water sources within departmental of?ce space.

During FY2007. the Bureau of Health eliminated all bottled water coolers where possible thoughout theirfacilities. saving on average of 72, 969 annually

?1 Oak Forest Hospital and Cermak still have bottled water coolers remaining. 9 and 4' respectively. in locations where no tap or bottle-less water coolers are available.
Cermak estimated annual cost ($32,500. lower than the average over the past three years. was based on costs provided through the survey.

Cost Data Provided by Comptrollers Of?ce 

 

 

Drinking Fountains and Water Oualitv .

Facilities Management performed an audit of the number of drinking fountains by facility and
determined how many were working properly and how many were not. It was determined in the
27 facilities surveyed, there are a total of 443 drinking fountains of which 397 (89 are
operating properly. This survey did not include the hospitals, however, that data was captured
through the water survey of all departments. It was determined that there are a total of 552
drinking fountains County wide. Table 4 on the following pages shows a summary of the
number of drinking water fountains by facility, the number working and not working, and
whether or not the water has been tested in that facility for safety.

Facilities Management also had tests performed on the quality of the water in the following
twelve facilities: County Building, 69 W. Washington, Medical Examiner?s Of?ce, the ?ve
suburban courthouses, Domestic Violence Courthouse, Hawthorne Warehouse, Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center, and Juvenile Court. It was determined that the water met all EPA
standards and is acceptable to drink in all of these facilities. It must be noted that there is a
perception among employees that the water coming out of the water fountains 15 not acceptable
to drink. Copies of the test results can be found 1n the Appendix.

Filtration Types
Once it is decided to replace bottled water coolers with bottle-less water systems, it will need to

be determined which type of ?ltration system will be installed. The two primary ?ltration
options for bottle?less water systems are standard ?ltration and reverse osmosis. Reverse
osmosis is a more complete ?ltration, however, is much more expensive. One vendor stated that
reverse osmosis was ?over ?ltration? for a large municipal water supply such as Chicago?s,
would result in slow water production leading to staff complaints, and would make the project
cost prohibitive due to the increased costs associated with a reverse osmosis system.

Installation Issues

The majority of the County facilities do not have plumbing in close proximity to the of?ce space.
The plumbing is primarily located in bathrooms, both public and private, and distances to of?ce
space widely varies depending on the facility. The longer the distance, the higher the cost due to
additional labor and materials required to install the system.

It must be noted that the vast majority of the companies which provide bottle-less water systems
do not use union plumbers to install these systems nor do they install using the materials required
by code in the City of Chicago, i.e. copper or stainless steel versus plastic. These two additional
requirements considerably increase the cost of installation of these systems. Vendors have
estimated that an installation of a system which is 50 feet or greater from a water source is will
cost an additional $200 to $700.

If the County were able to utilize in-house plumbing staff currently working for Facilities

Management, this cost could be reduced. However, it must be noted that Facilities Management
does not currently have enough staff to dedicate to this large project.

It must also be noted that the County does not own all the facilities which are occupied by
County agencies such as the Daley Center, police courts, rental facilities, etc. and the County
cannot require these building owners to install the plumbing required for bottle-less water
coolers. Facilities Management does not operate 69 W. Washington, however, the Of?ce of the
Building has begun installing bottle?less water systems as a pilot project. The hospitals would
need to have Buildings and Grounds staff perform the installations if it was determined to have
the systems installed in?house.

Disposal Issues
Once a bottled water cooler is replaced, it cannot be simply disposed or salvaged. Each system

will need to have an engineer evacuate the freon from the system and dispose of the freon in a
proper manner prior to removal. Facilities Management estimates that the freon evacuation and
disposal process will cost up to $100 per system.

Discussions and Facility Tours with Vendors Possible Pilot Proieet

Purchasing identi?ed twelve locations, eight in the County Building and four in the Bridgeview
Courthouse, for the installation of reverse osmosis bottle-less water dispensers as a pilot project.
Purchasing, Facilities Management, Industrial Engineering, and representatives of four bottle-less
water dispenser vendors toured each of these facilities. During these tours, Facilities
Management informed the vendors that union tradespeople would be required for any work
performed on a County facility. This included any required plumbing, carpentry, plastering,
painting, or electrical work.

Of the four vendors who toured the facilities, only one submitted a cost proposal for the 12
reverse osmosis systems. The other vendors did not submit a cost proposal on a reverse osmosis
system because they believe reverse osmosis ?ltering was over ?ltration for a large municipal
water supply such as Chicago?s, would result in slow water production leading to staff
complaints, and would make the project cost prohibitive due to the increased costs associated
with a reverse osmosis system. One vendor submitted a cost proposal for ?standard? NSF
certi?ed ?ltration and requested to not be included in the process if the County decided on
reverse osmosis ?ltering. This proposal quotes the per unit rental costs plus the hourly
labor charge for installation and indicates that all installation charges will be passed on the
County at cost broken down by unit.

At the current time, this pilot project has been put on hold until decisions are made on the
direction of the bottled water cooler replacement project County wide.

Replacement Alternatives and Associated Costs

The following shows the costs associated with the current situation compared to three different
alternatives over a ?ve year period, the estimated depreciative life of the water system. No
matter which option is chosen, Purchasing would need to develop speci?cations for the project
so that it can be competitively bid.

Current Situation Costs

Data provided by the Comptroller?s Of?ce indicated that the estimated average annual bottled
water and water systems cost over the past three years is $553,289. As stated previously in the
report, the Bureau of Health has removed all bottled water coolers from their facilities where
possible and have reduced the County?s costs by $172,969. Therefore, the current estimated
annual cost for bottled water and water systems is $3 80,320. This total includes the leasing
costs, ?lter costs, and bottled water re?ll costs. Annual costs by department between 2005 and

2007 can be found in Table 3 on page 9.

The total estimated five year cost of the current situation is $1,889,100.

Option 1- Replace All Svstems
This option is to replace all existing bottled water coolers with bottle- less systems in facilities

which are owned and operated by the County. The replacement of all the County 3 current
bottled water coolers with bottle-less water systems would have a large, immediate ?nancial
impact on the County. If all 1,210 bottled water coolers were replaced with County owned
systems, the estimated initial capital cost is $2,057,000, with a ?ve year estimated cost of
$2,783,000 which includes maintenance, annual replacement of ?lters, and the disposal of the
existing systems. This option would eliminate the estimated $380,320 annual cost of bottled
water and have a payback in approximately 8.4 years. The calculation of these estimates are as

follows:

Capital and Installation Cost
Average Cost of Bottle-less Water Cooler: 700
Average Installation Cost of Cooler: $1,000 (Facilities Management estimate)
$1,700

Facilities Management estimated the installation costs including materials as well
as the use of union tradespeople including plumbers, carpenters, and painters.
This cost could range from $400 to $2,000 depending on the location of the unit
and the distance the unit is from the water source. The current price of copper is

extremely expensive.

1,210 coolers $1,700 $2,057,000

-14-

Ongoing Maintenance/Filter Costs

The majority of the bottle-less coolers will need to have the ?lter replaced on an annual
basis at an estimated cost of $50. The systems from time to time will need maintenance
services which will have an average annual cost of $50.

Estimated Annual Filter/Maintenance Cost: $100 1,210 $121,000

Disposal of Existing Sy. stems

Facilities Management estimated the cost of the required evacuation of the freon from the
existing bottled water coolers and the disposal of the system $100.

Estimated Disposal Cost: $100 1,210 $121,000
Over a ?ve year period, the total cost of this alternative would be $2,783,000 as follows:
$2,057,000 ($121,000 5) $121,000 $2,783,000

The payback period for this option would be approximately 8.4 years. The estimated life
of the bottle-less water systems is 5 to 10 years depending on the usage and maintenance.

The County could choose to spread the cost over several years by renting/ leasing the systems
instead of purchasing the bottle-less water coolers. Vendors provided rental estimates
which ranged from $32 to $45 per month, or $384 to $540 annually, which included installation
of the cooler using non-union trades and plastic tubing. None of the vendors provided a quote
using the union trades and copper/stainless steel piping.

Just for cost calculation purposes, assuming that the lease cost would be on the high end of the
quotes at $45 per unit, replacing all 1,210 bottled water coolers would cost $653,400 annually, or

$3,267,000 over ?ve years.

It must be noted that there will be a portion of the County?s bottled water coolers will not be able
to be replaced because they are located in facilities not operated by the County. In order to
replace the 334 units in the Daley Center, the County would need to work with the Public
Building Commission to have the project funded and approved.

Option II - Phased Installation of Bottle-Less Water Systems
This Option is a phased replacement of the bottled water coolers. Phase I would have bottle-less

water coolers installed on a building by building basis, in all locations near an existing water
source and require departments to eliminate all their bottled water coolers. All departments
would have access to at least one water cooler. Exceptions would be made to keep bottled water
coolers' 1n locations that have public health concerns and do not have. a water source in close
proximity to the existing cooler.

-15-

Phase II of this option would be to assess the needs of each facility and department for additional
bottle-less water systems that are necessary for logistical or public health reasons. Once an
assessment is completed, additional bottle-less water systems could be installed.

This Option will immediately reduce the number of water coolers throughout the County and
reduce the County? 3 operating expenditures Assuming only half of the current bottled water
coolers were replaced, the initial cost is estimated to be 028, 500 with a ?ve year estimated
cost of $1,391,500 which includes maintenance, annual replacement of ?lters, and the disposal of
the existing coolers. This option would eliminate a good portion of the estimated $380,320
annual cost of bottled water and have a payback in approximately 3.4 years. The calculation of
these estimates are as follows:

Capital and Installation Cost
Average Cost of. Bottle?less Water Cooler: 700

Average Installation Cost of Cooler: $1,000
$1,700

605 coolers $1,700 $1,028,500

Ongoing Maintenance/Filter Costs

The majority of the bottle-less coolers will need to have the ?lter replaced on an annual
basis at an estimated cost of $50. The systems from time to time will need maintenance
services which will have an average annual cost of $50.

Estimated Annual Filter/Maintenance Cost: $100 605 $60,500

Disposal of Existing Sy stems
Facilities Management estimated the cost of the required evacuation of the freon from the

existing bottled water coolers and the disposal of the system $100.
Estimated Disposal Cost: $100 605 $60,500

Over a ?ve year period, the total cost of this alternative would be $1,391 ,500 as follows:
$1,028,500 ($60,500 5) $60,500 $1,391,500

The payback period for this option would be approximately 3.4 years. The estimated life
of the bottle-less water systems is 5 to 10 years depending on the usage and maintenance.

Again, the County could choose to spread the cost over several years by renting/leasing the
systems instead of purchasing the bottle-less water coolers. Using the same costs as shown in
Option 1 for cost calculation purposes, replacing 605 bottled water coolers would cost $326,700
annually, or $1,633,500 over ?ve years.

Option Ill - Installation of Building Filtration Svstems

Building-wide ?ltration systems in County owned facilities could be installed, however, it would
be the most costly of the three options. This would ?lter and purify water coming into the
building which would be stored in a large tank and distributed throughout the building either
through existing pipe or new pipe installed directly to faucets, water fountains, or dispenser
systems.

If the County installed a building-wide system and distributed ?ltered water through all existing
pipes in the facility, only a small portion of the buildings water usage would be used for drinking
with a large percentage of water used for hygienic or operational purposes (toilets, cleaning and
janitorial, chillers/boilers, landscaping, etc.) which does not require further ?ltering. Current
plumbing con?gurations in County facilities make it dif?cult, costly, or possibly infeasible to
separate the two water systems.

The estimated capital cost of a building wide ?ltration system and tank varies greatly and is
dependant on many factors including incoming water quality, pressure, and temperature from the
municipal water supply, average daily facility usage, and physical building characteristics and
desired output pressure. Commercial reverse osmosis systems with pretreatment can cost from
$20,000 for lower usage County facilities to more than $160,000 for large usage facilities. This
estimated cost includes the capital cost of the system equipment, however, does not include the
costs of system installation, new or additional required plumbing required to distribute the
?ltered water, individual dispensers/fountains, or system maintenance/ ?lters, all of which could
be very costly. If drinking water was not separately plumbed from hygienic or operational usage,
a larger system would be required. Even though a dedicated drinking water system would require
a smaller system, a large amount of new plumbing would need to be installed.
