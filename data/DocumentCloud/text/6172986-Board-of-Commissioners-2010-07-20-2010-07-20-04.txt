 EXPLANATION
In the Summer of 2008, the Board of Commissioners authorized the CHA to enter into a security
contract for a two (2) year base period commencing on August 1, 2008 and ending on July 31,
2010 (the “Base Term”), with a one year option exercisable at the CHA’s discretion upon the
expiration of the Base Term. The security contract initially included three HCV Satellite Office
locations; 1550 West 88th Street, 1749 East 75th Street, 3333 West Arthington, the CHA’s
warehouse at 2325 S. Federal, the CHA’s Family Investment Center and the CHA’s main
administrative offices located at 60 East Van Buren.
During the second year of the Base Term of Contract No. 8052, changes in security coverage
became necessary at certain locations, due in part to the winding down of the CHA’s warehouse
and the extension of open hours at various HCV Satellite Office locations. Consequently, the
extended daily hours of security services resulted in costs that exceeded the amounts originally
budgeted for the Base Term of Contract No. 8052. The CHA entered into Amendment No.1 for
Contract No. 8052, adding Seventy Nine Thousand Dollars ($79,000) to the original not-toexceed compensation to cover the additional service requirements that resulted from increased
security coverage at the HCV Satellite Office locations and administrative office locations.
The CHA will incur additional costs associated with increased security requirements through the
July 31, 2010 expiration date for Contract No. 8052 in the amount of $20,000.00, due to
continued increased service levels, including augmented service requirements attributable to the
opening of the CHA’s Family Wait List and to security services needed at the Family Investment
Center.
The CHA now seeks to exercise the option reserved under the Security Services Agreement to
provide services at the applicable locations for the one (1) year term commencing on August 1,
2010. The amendment effecting the requested authorization to exercise the Option Term will
reflect updated contractual terms for the Option Term, including modified coverage locations
and areas, and modified coverage times applicable for the Option Term and the respective
locations. The locations requiring security coverage during the Option Term include: 2750
West Roosevelt Road; 3500 S. State Street, 5th floor; 1749 – 51 & 1755 - 57 East 75th Street; 60
East Van Buren; and 4859 S. Wabash.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the one (1) year
extension option for the Security Services Agreement in the amount not-to-exceed $675,702.56.
Furthermore, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize an amendment to Contract No.
8052 to memorialize the updated coverage levels and contractual terms applicable to the CHA
Administrative Offices and HCV Satellite Offices for the Option Term. The requested
authorization would result in total not-to-exceed compensation under Contract No. 8052 in the
amount of $2,124,702.56.
