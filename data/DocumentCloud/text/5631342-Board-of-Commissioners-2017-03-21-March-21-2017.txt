 Commissioner Meghan Harte joins the meeting in session at approximately 9:55 a.m.
(Item 1)
The resolution for Item 1 ratifies the acceptance of a grant award from HUD in the amount of $452,000
from HUD’s ROSS for Education Project SOAR, increase the FY 2017 comprehensive budget by the
same amount, and authorize CHA to utilize the grant funds to enter into an agreement with the
Northeastern University Center for College Access and Success in the amount of $20,000. The ROSS for
Education program, also known as Project SOAR (Students + Opportunities + Achievements = Results),
is a new two-year demonstration program reflecting HUD’s commitment to expand educational services
to youth living in HUD-assisted public housing. Research shows there are large gaps in college
attendance by family income that are not driven by level of preparation. A key barrier to college
attendance is that low-income youth are least likely to complete the Free Application for Federal Student
Aid (FAFSA) even though they are most in need of financial aid. The ROSS for Education program
provides grant funding to public housing authorities to deploy education navigators to provide
individualized assistance to public housing youth between the ages of 15-20 and their families in
FAFSA completion, financial literacy and college readiness, post-secondary program applications and
post-acceptance assistance.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-31
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated March 21, 2017 entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO RATIFY
THE ACCEPTANCE OF A GRANT AWARD FROM THE UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (“HUD”) AND
ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY
CENTER FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS”

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners ratifies the acceptance of a grant award from the United
States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) in the amount of
$452,000 from HUD’s ROSS for Education Project SOAR, authorizes an increase to
the FY 2017 comprehensive budget by the same amount, and authorize CHA to
utilize the grant funds to enter into an agreement with the Northeastern University
Center for College Access and Success in the amount of $20,000.

(Item 2)
The resolution for Item 2 approves the purchase of insurance coverage for CHA's Property Managers'
Insurance Program (PMIP) through its insurance broker of record, Arthur J Gallagher & Company, for
the period of April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018 for an aggregate amount not-to-exceed $841,078 as
follows: (1) Primary General Liability coverage written through First Specialty/Swiss Re American
Holding in an amount not-to-exceed $411,608; (2) Umbrella Liability coverage written through First
Specialty/Swiss Re American Holding in an amount not-to-exceed $321,470; and (3) Excess Liability
written through Allied Word Assurance Company in an amount not-to-exceed $108,000. The PMIP was
created in 1999 as the solution to provide liability protection for the Authority and its property
management firms. By purchasing insurance to cover all liabilities associated with the management of
the portfolio, the Authority is able to control claims and expenses within the self-insured layer while
maintaining consistent coverage for itself and each Property Manager, even when management firms or
insurers transition. The current Property Management contract requires the Property Manager to
2

 participate in the PMIP. The Authority utilizes a commercial insurance brokerage firm to place all of its
Property & Casualty insurance coverages. This is done because insurance products can only be
purchased through a licensed insurance broker. In 2001 the CHA received an exemption from HUD
allowing it to purchase insurance through a licensed insurance broker. This is the third major insurance
placement conducted by Arthur J Gallagher, our broker of record. The process included submitting
insurance specifications, claim data, and resident demographics to underwriters to formulate pricing for
insurance coverage. The specifications were submitted to 29 insurers, some of which quoted multiple
lines of coverage.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-32
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board letter dated March 21, 2017 entitled: AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE
INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR PROPERTY MANAGERS’ INSURANCE
PROGRAM COVERAGE FROM FIRST SPECIALTY/SWISS RE AMERICAN
HOLDINGS FOR GENERAL LIABILITY AND UMBRELLA LIABILITY
COVERAGE, AND ALLIED WORLD ASSURANCE COMPANY (AWAC) FOR
EXCESS LIABILITY COVERAGE.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
purchase the insurance coverage for CHA's Property Managers' Insurance Program
("PMIP") through its insurance broker of record, Arthur J Gallagher & Company
(“AJG”), for the period of April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018 for an aggregate
amount not-to-exceed $841,078 broken down as follows: (1) Primary General
Liability coverage written through First Specialty/Swiss Re American Holding in an
amount not-to-exceed $411,608; (2) Umbrella Liability coverage written through
First Specialty/Swiss Re American Holding in an amount not-to-exceed $321,470;
and (3) Excess Liability written through Allied Word Assurance Company
(“AWAC”) in an amount not-to-exceed $108,000.
This award is not subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 3)
A Request for Proposal was advertised in area newspapers inviting qualified vendors to provide
proposals for Mobile Services and Equipment. Proposals from three Respondents were received and
reviewed by an evaluation team. All three Respondents, were invited to oral presentations. After oral
presentations and respective negotiation discussions, Best and Final Offers (BAFO) were requested and
received. After scoring the initial proposals, oral presentations, and the BAFO's, AT&T’s proposal was
determined to be the most advantageous to the Authority. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 3
approves award of contract to AT&T Inc. to provide mobile equipment, accessories and services in an
amount not-to-exceed $1,167,246 for a three-year base term, from May 1, 2017 through April 30, 2020,
with two one-year options in an amount not-to-exceed $389,082 per option year, for an aggregate not-toexceed contract amount of $1,945,410. The Board delegates authority to the Chief Executive Officer to
use his discretion to exercise the options. The Chief Executive Officer shall not exercise more than one
option in any year. CHA requires equipment consisting of Smartphones, Tablets and Hotspots, in order
to support its day-to-day operations. The technology is used to increase staff productivity and to provide
increased customer service to CHA’s stakeholders.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-33

CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to

three (3) year base term from May 1, 2017 through April 30, 2020, in an amount not-toexceed $1,167,246, with two (2) one-year options, in the not-to-exceed amount of

said resolutions adopted.
(Item No. 4)
The resolution for Item 4 approves the FY2016 Moving to Work (MTW) Annual Report and authorize
the CEO to submit the report to HUD for approval. Submission of the FY2016 MTW Annual Report
fulfills CHA’s annual MTW reporting requirements and supports CHA’s goal of successful continued
compliance with the obligations of HUD’s MTW Demonstration Program. CHA and HUD signed the
original MTW Agreement on February 6, 2000, which allowed CHA to implement the original Plan for
Transformation. CHA’s Amended and Restated MTW Agreement with HUD was fully executed on
June 26, 2008, which extended CHA’s participation in the MTW Demonstration Program through
FY2018. On April 14, 2016, HUD extended the MTW Agreement through 2028. As part of the MTW
Agreement, CHA is required to submit an Annual Report to HUD, due 90 days after the end of the fiscal
year. The FY2016 Annual Report provides information necessary for HUD to assess CHA’s
performance in FY2016 in its operations, as well as activities authorized by the MTW Demonstration
Program.

 After presentation by staff, Commissioners discussed the following: unit delivery and progress of 25,000
unit goal. A Commission recommended that the report be shared with the public.
Commissioner Harte presented a Motion for approval of Item No. 4.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-34
The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March 21, 2017
requesting approval of the FY2016 MTW Annual Report, attached hereto;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

The Board of Commissioners hereby approves the FY2016 Moving to Work Annual
Report and authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, the Board Chairperson, or their
designee to make any final updates as deemed necessary;

THAT,

This approval of the FY2016 MTW Annual Report supersedes any and all conflicting
language found in prior CHA MTW Annual Reports;

THAT,

The Board of Commissioners grants authorization to submit the FY2016 MTW
Annual Report to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development upon
Board approval. Such approval shall constitute conclusive evidence of the Board’s
approval of any and all such changes.

There being no questions or discussion, Chairman Hooker thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolution adopted.
(Item No. 5 – This Number Not Used)
(Item No. 6)
The resolution for Item 6 approves submittal of Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) financing plans
to HUD and enter into two RAD Conversion Commitments with HUD for the following two properties:
Judge Fisher Apartments, and Las Americas Apartments; commit CHA funds not to exceed $18,118,040
to fund initial deposits to the replacement reserves, rehabilitation and site work, as well as transaction
costs; execute Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) contracts and such other documents as may be
required for the financing and operation of the listed properties; transfer ownership of the improvements
to Chicago Housing Administration LLC and execute 99-year ground leases for the underlying land; and
execute and deliver such other documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
5

 to implement the foregoing. RAD provides an opportunity for housing authorities to utilize either
project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental assistance contracts to stabilize funding for up to
185,000 units of public housing. A primary goal of RAD is to use long-term contracts to leverage
private financing for capital improvements while preserving affordability. Through the RAD program,
HUD provides rental subsidies to the owners of properties pursuant to a long-term Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP) contract that will be renewed at the expiration of each 20-year contract term. This
ensures the units remain affordable to low-income households. Residents will continue to pay 30% of
their income towards rent. Judge Fisher Apartments, located at 5821 N. Broadway, is a 22-story
building designated as senior public housing that currently contains 199 residential rental units. The
building is located on a .95-acre site and was built in 1964.
The building needs completion of
rehabilitation that is underway, including exterior façade repairs, windows and elevator modernization.
The CHA Board previously authorized the submission of a RAD financing plan to enter into a RAD
Conversion Commitment with HUD in May 2016. However, subsequent to Board approval, it was
discovered that additional work was needed at the property and additional plans were required; therefore,
a financing plan was not submitted to HUD at that time. Las Americas, located at 1611 S. Racine, is a
9-story building designated as senior public housing that currently contains 212 residential rental units.
The building is located on a 3.3-acre site and was built in 1976.
The building needs exterior shell
repairs, common area renovations, and elevator modernization. Longer range plans include more
extensive rehabilitation over the next 20 years. Since CHA intends to assume the role of contract
administrator for all of the portfolio properties converting to RAD a separate entity, Chicago Housing
Administration LLC, has been established pursuant to Resolution No. 2015-CHA-109, to own the
converted RAD properties. CHA is the sole member of Chicago Housing Administration LLC. At the
RAD conversion closing(s), CHA will transfer ownership of the improvements to Chicago Housing
Administration LLC and execute a 99-year Ground Lease for the underlying land.
Commissioner Markowski presented a motion for the approval of Item No. 6.

said resolution adopted.
(Item No. 7)
The resolution for Item No. 7 approves modification to the contract with Madison Construction totaling
$1,748,967.16. The original scope of work at Caroline Hedger Apartments was to bring the building
into compliance with the City of Chicago’s High Rise Sprinkler and Life Safety ordinances and to
modernize the building. This project was designed in late 2012 prior to the implementation of the revised
CHA design standards. However, after construction began at Caroline Hedger, the scope of work
increased significantly due to the widespread discovered conditions such as deteriorated plumbing risers
and asbestos encountered while trying to complete the original base scope of work. Due to the
overwhelming amount of discovered conditions found during construction, the scope of work of this
project grew substantially. As a result, this extended the regular construction timeline significantly. The
construction project at Caroline Hedger is expected to be completed in August 2017. These change
orders will address the remaining outstanding issues before construction is complete. CHA has an
established internal change order process that vets potential change orders prior to approval for
additional contract values under the Significant Actions Policy and prior to seeking board approval for
those above the threshold. The CHA Change Order process involves a comprehensive evaluation of a
potential change by the change order committee comprised of CCD leadership and legal staff.
7

 After presentation by staff on Item 6, a question and answer session ensued. Matters discussed included
construction completion date; per unit cost; rehab versus demolition of building due to construction cost;
cumulative cost of change orders and percentage of change orders due to discovered conditions. A
Commissioner requested staff to provide a report comparing the number of change orders received prior
to the newly established internal change order process was implemented.
Commissioner Chico presented a Motion for the approval of Item No. 7.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-36
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated March 21, 2017 entitled “Authorization to Execute a
Contract Modification for C-11464 for Modernization and Life Safety Upgrades
at Caroline Hedger”.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute a contract modification to C-11464 with Madison
Construction for the Modernization and Life Safety Upgrades at Caroline Hedger
in an amount not-to-exceed $1,748,967.16.
This item is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

There being no questions or discussion, Chairman Hooker thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolution adopted.
(Item No. 8)
The CHA issued an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in February 2017 to procure a general contractor to
complete a full modernization of the Scattered Site properties located at 3640 and 3650 W. Congress
Parkway and 3647 W. 5th Avenue. The IFB was advertised in area newspapers and on the CHA website.
CHA solicited 37 vendors, including 385 Section 3 businesses. A total of eight responsive bids were
received and All Chicago, Inc. submitted the lowest lump sum bid. Accordingly, the resolution for Item
No. 8 approves award of contract to All Chicago in the firm fixed price of $9,575,200.00 plus a not-toexceed amount of $574,512.00 in contingency (6%, which is in line with industry standards) strictly
8

 limited to potential change orders justified as discovered conditions or code compliance issues for a total
not-to-exceed amount of $10,149,712.00. The Congress Parkway Apartments are located near the south
border of Garfield Park at 3640 and 3650 W. Congress Parkway and 3647 W. 5th Ave. These Scattered
Site family buildings are bounded on the east by Millard Avenue, on the north by 5th Avenue, on the
west by the Eisenhower Expressway and on the south by Independence Boulevard. The site is adjacent
to the Irene McCoy Gaines Senior Apartments. The mid-rise buildings consist of three (3), three-story
buildings, all the same in size and appearance. Each mid-rise building shares a common courtyard and
contains 12 dwelling units, totaling to 36 units. These mid-rise buildings are partially occupied but will
be vacant at start of construction. The apartments are currently three-bedroom units and this project will
convert them to two-bedroom units. This project will also improve the exterior site conditions by
upgrading the parking lot, sidewalks, landscaping and utility replacement/relocation. This project will
also convert one residential unit to a computer lounge for resident’s use on the ground floor of 3650 W.
Congress. At completion, this construction project will return 36 newly renovated units to the leasing
portfolio. According to an assessment report on the buildings Prepared by Holabird & Root, LLC., the
overall condition of the buildings is extremely poor. The envelope of each building needs repair of the
brick surfaces, tuck pointing, and cleaning. The existing electrical service requires replacement with a
new metered service per building. The mechanical systems and roofing systems are beyond their
effective useful life and replacement is required. The impact of the wear and tear throughout the years is
apparent and all finishes and systems are deteriorated and in substandard conditions. The Congress
Parkway Apartments modernization project will require the general contractor to remove and replace all
interior finishes, drywall, doors, flooring, kitchen and bathroom cabinetry and all mechanical, electrical
and plumbing systems in 36 units. Additional mechanical, electrical and plumbing improvements are
being made and all existing exposed corridors are being enclosed, and entry vestibules are being added
to all three structures.
After presentation by staff on Item No. 8, Commissioners discussed the following matters: unit cost;
new construction vs. rehab or demolition of building due to construction cost and funding of project.
Commissioner Chico presented a Motion for the approval of Item No. 8.
RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-37
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board

(Item No. 9)
The resolution for Item 9 approves an Agreement to enter into A Housing Assistance Payment Contract
(AHAP) for Midwest Apartments; and Housing Assistance Payment Contracts (HAP) for Midwest
Apartments and Leland Apartments. Initial contract rents will be determined by market comparables
and fair market rents applicable at the time the HAP contract is executed. All rent determinations will
comply with federal regulations and CHA policy. Midwest Apartments is a thirteen-story, historic
building built in 1926 located at 6 N. Hamlin Boulevard in the West Garfield Park community in a
Limited Area. Midwest Apartments is included the Mayor’s SRO Preservation Initiative to preserve
affordable housing throughout Chicago. An AHAP is required before the developer can start façade
renovations. The HAP Contract must be issued before CHA waitlist tenants move in. The property
contains 276 studio units of approximately 300 square feet and up-to 69 units will be assisted by projectbased vouchers through CHA’s PRA program. The term of the HAP contract will be 30 years. All
utilities are included and each apartment has a private bathroom and kitchen. Parking is available on the
west side of the building in a surface lot on Madison. There is a controlled entry system and security
cameras throughout the building and at all entrances. All PRA residents will come from CHA waitlists.
Existing vacant units will be filled once the HAP is signed. Midwest Limited Partnership owns the
property and Holsten Real Estate Development Corporation (Holsten) is part of the ownership entity.
Holsten has operated the building for over 20 years. Holsten has developed over 2,400 units of housing

units consist of 108 studios with 250 square feet and 29 1-bedroom units with 500 square feet. All units
have full kitchens and bathrooms, with all utilities included. Currently the building is 95% occupied, and
provides housing to approximately 50% men and 50% women who range in ages from 30 to 70 years
old. The property currently has 14 PRA units and is seeking a second PRA contract for 20 additional
PRA units with a term of 30 years. The new PRA units will have a preference for veterans. Of the 20
additional units, 8 units will be studios and 12 will be one-bedroom units. All units will be filled from
CHA waitlist(s) tenants as vacancies occur, with a veteran’s preference. The building includes 4,000
square feet of commercial space, a community room, office spaces for property management and social
services and a small courtyard space. All residential units are above the 1st floor. On-site security will be
10

 provided through security cameras monitored by the 24-hour security guard at the front desk.

(Item No. 11)
The resolution for Item 11 approves the Tenant Selection Plan, Lease and Lease Riders for the Julia C.
Lathrop Homes Phase 1A and Subsequent Rental Phases and amends the CHA Admissions and
Continued Occupancy Policy to incorporate such documents as an addendum thereto; Lathrop was
constructed in 1938 and consisted of 32 low-rise buildings for a total of 925 units on 34 acres of land.
Lathrop was one of the original three “demonstration projects” which were the first public housing
developments in the city of Chicago. The overall revitalization plan for historic Lathrop includes a
multi-phased, mixed-income, mixed-use development that will be conducted over three on-site phases
and will consist of 1,116 total residential units of which 400 will be Rental Assistance Demonstration
(RAD) program units. It is understood that the developer has an interest and desire to implement its own
lease forms and policy that encourages consistent community standards for the effective management of
the development.
Commissioner Harte presented a Motion for the approval of Item No. 11.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-40
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated March
21, 2017 entitled “Authorization to: 1) Approve the Tenant Selection
Plan, Lease and Lease Riders for the Lathrop Homes Phase 1A and
subsequent rental phases and amend the CHA Admissions and Continued
Occupancy Policy to incorporate such documents as an addendum
thereto; and 2) Execute and deliver such other documents and perform
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the
foregoing.”

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to: 1) Approve the Tenant Selection Plan, Lease and Lease Riders for the Lathrop
Homes Phase 1A and subsequent rental phases and amend the CHA Admissions and
Continued Occupancy Policy to incorporate such documents as an addendum thereto;
and 2) Execute and deliver such other documents and perform such actions as may be

 There being no questions or discussion, Chairman Hooker thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolution adopted.
(Item No. 12)
The resolution for Item 12 consents to the withdrawal of MB Real Estate Services from the Madden
Wells Phase I Homeownership Development Team; and approves the addition of The Community
Builders (TCB) to the Development Team. The resolution also amends the Development Agreement
and Settlement Agreement for Madden Wells Phase I Homeownership. It is the intent of the CHA to
implement a sustainable, community-sensitive revitalization program with the goal of creating a vibrant
community on the remaining vacant CHA land that was formerly part of the Ida B. Wells, Darrow
Homes, Wells Extension, and Madden Park Homes public housing developments. Over the last twelve
years, CHA has worked in collaboration with its development partners, Oakwood Boulevard Associates
(OBA) and Granite Partners for Oakwood Boulevard (GPOB), to create 863 mixed-income housing
units in the new Oakwood Shores development on a portion of the site. In October 2012, the CHA,
GPOB and Oakwood Funding, the holder of the Promissory Note executed by Granite, executed a
Settlement Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, undeveloped land designated for Phase 1C for
homeownership units was returned to CHA. CHA paid a settlement amount to Oakwood Funding to
regain ownership of the parcels. The Amended Settlement Agreement sets forth the terms of repayment
to CHA. In September 2016, Granite Development Corp. as the managing member of GPOB, requested
to remove MB Real Estate Services as a member of the for sale Phase 1 development team and add TCB,
a partner on the successful phases of rental development. These changes will be incorporated in the First
Amendment to the Development Agreement for Madden Wells Phase I Homeownership and First
Amendment to the Settlement Agreement. The Office of the General Counsel, Department of
Procurement and Contracts and Development agree that the withdrawal of MB Real Estate Services and
replacement of TCB as a member of the development team will not materially affect the procurement
for several reasons. While MB Real Estate services’ experience in rental property management was
important to the team, their responsibilities in the partnership can be absorbed by TCB. TCB is a national
developer and has the capacity to assume MB Real Estate Services’ responsibilities. TCB also has
previous experience as the development partner on the rental portion of this development and numerous
other City projects.
Commissioner Markowski presented a Motion for the approval of Item 12.
