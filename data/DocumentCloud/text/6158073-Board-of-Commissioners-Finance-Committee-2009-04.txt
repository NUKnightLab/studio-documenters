applicant provides objective and credible evidence including,
but not limited to, an economic impact study that
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that designation as a class 8a property will
allow the commercial enterprise to be economically viable
and thereby continue its operations so that the commercial
enterprise can continue to occupy and fully utilize the real
estate for an extended period of time.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that commercial enterprise has undergone a
significant reduction in net operating income of at least 40%
in the year it makes application for the incentive as compared
to the average net operating income of the commercial
enterprise in the prior three years;

b.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that class 8a designation of the property is
necessary for the ongoing commercial enterprise to continue
its operations and that without such designation the
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable
causing the property to become vacant and unused;

c.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that it supports and consents to the designation of the
property as a class 8a property absent an abandonment
requirement; and

d.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that it supports and consents to the application made to the
Cook County Assessor requesting designation as a class 8a
property absent an abandonment requirement.

provisions of this section, the municipality in which the real estate is
located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:
a.

a finding by the municipality that it has determined that class
8a designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing
commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that
without such designation the commercial enterprise would
not be economically viable causing the property to become
vacant and unused;

b.

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents
to the action by the Cook County Board of Commissioners to
support designation of the property as a class 8a property;

c.

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents
to the class 8a application to the Cook County Assessor; and
