RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THE FY2011 MOVING TO WORK
ANNUAL PLAN – PLAN FOR TRANSFORMATION YEAR 12
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the FY2011 Moving To
Work Annual Plan – Plan For Transformation Year 12 (FY2011 MTW Annual Plan).
EXPLANATION
On January 6, 2000, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Board of Commissioners
approved the Plan for Transformation, which called for sweeping changes in both the
administration and operation of CHA. The Plan for Transformation was approved by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and incorporated into a
Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration Agreement, which was executed on February 6,
2000. The Agreement was subsequently amended in February 2001, requiring CHA to
submit an annual plan to HUD, describing anticipated activities that will utilize MTW
flexibility.
On June 26, 2008, CHA executed an Amended and Restated MTW Agreement (Restated
Agreement) between itself and HUD, which supersedes the original MTW Agreement. The
Restated Agreement extends CHA’s participation in the MTW Demonstration to the end of
FY2018. CHA’s continued participation in the MTW Program is contingent upon
adherence to the requirements set out in the Restated Agreement, which includes
submission of an Annual Plan. The document represents CHA's FY2011 MTW Annual
Plan and details CHA’s anticipated activities for FY2011.
CHA has organized the discussions of activities in the FY2011 MTW Annual Plan under
the following Sections: Introduction, General Housing Authority Operating Information,
Non-MTW Related Housing Authority Information, Long-Term MTW Plan, Proposed
MTW Activities – HUD Approval Requested, Ongoing MTW Activities - HUD Approval
Previously Granted, Sources and Uses of Funds, and Administrative.
Each activity CHA seeks to engage in that either uses MTW funds or requires a MTW
regulatory waiver, has to meet at least one of the following three MTW Statutory
Objectives:

MTW Statutory Objective I: Increase housing choices for lowincome families.

 

MTW Statutory Objective II: Give incentives to families with
children where the head of household is working, seeking work, or is
preparing for work by participating in job training, educational
programs, or programs that assist people to obtain employment and
become economically self-sufficient.



MTW Statutory Objective III: Reduce costs and achieve greater
cost effectiveness in federal expenditures.

Prior to submission of the FY2011 MTW Annual Plan to the Board, a 30-day public
comment period was conducted wherein both residents and the public alike were able to
submit comments orally and in writing, regarding the information contained in the
proposed Plan. The public comment period ran from September 10 through October 9,
2010. During such time, on September 21, 2010, a public comment hearing was held.
Prior to finalizing the FY2011 MTW Annual Plan, CHA gave consideration to comments
received during the public comment period.
To this end, CHA has complied with the requirements of the Restated Agreement and
HUD regulations regarding annual plans. CHA requests that the Board of Commissioners
approve the FY2011 MTW Annual Plan, and the form, CHA Certifications of Compliance
with MTW Plan Requirements and Related Regulations. Pending Board approval, CHA
will submit the FY2011 MTW Annual Plan to HUD.
