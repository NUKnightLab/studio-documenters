Report from System Chief Financial Officer (continued)
With regard to the revenue report, Mr. Ayres stated that for the fifth month in a row, they are under budget
in revenues. It is falling in Medicaid; this has to do with volumes and rates. They continue to investigate
this issue; they are reaching the conclusion that it is not related to any single triggering event. He
anticipates to have further information on this issue to provide by the May 27th Board Meeting. Director
O’Donnell inquired why this appears to have happened all of a sudden. Mr. Ayres responded that they have
considered several factors, including the conversion from three Medicaid qualification vendors to one and
the change in contract rates with the State. The issue of volume appears to be the most significant factor, as
in each one of the units there has been a decrease in patient days.
Efforts to address the issue of volume were discussed. Mr. Ayres provided information on several areas
relating to this, including building affiliations with federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) and working
on building a managed care program, to deal with the major third parties as well as the infrastructure
designed to support the health management organizations (HMOs) with the State. Chairman Carvalho
speculated that the lack of continuity in key leadership in the past may have been a factor in this issue.
Additionally, he referenced Health Connect, which is the State’s program that now requires Medicaid
enrollees to be assigned to a medical home; he noted that the State is actively trying to get the System more
engaged in this program.
Mr. Ayres noted that one issue that has impacted the ongoing discussions with the FQHCs is the System’s
inconsistency relating to co-pay policies. He provided an example of a typical affiliation with an FQHC, in
which the FQHC would refer the patient to an entity for inpatient or specialty care. He stated that FQHCs
require co-pays to be collected for services provided in their entity. If the FQHC affiliates with an entity
that does not have similar co-pay policies, their concern is that the patient will “de-select” the FQHC and
will in turn “select” the entity whose co-pay policy is more attractive to the patient.
The Committee continued the discussion. Board Chairman Batts noted that, although the Medicaid volume
has declined, the self-pay volume has substantially increased. The Committee discussed the subject of
addressing the community’s unmet needs. Chairman Carvalho stated that the strategic plan is meant to
address unmet needs. He noted that the System and all of the private hospitals collectively do not meet all
of the needs for indigent care in the County, if measured by the unfavorable community health status
indicators for people in Cook County. Director Muñoz provided examples of charity care provided by
private doctors to address unmet needs. He stated that this is a significant issue in the Hispanic community;
they continue to try to find ways to marshal those uninsured or ineligible patients into a medical home.
As it relates to the subject, Mr. Foley asked Mr. Ayres to comment on the performance of MedAssets and
the eligibility vendor. Mr. Ayres responded that they are now qualifying over four hundred patients per
month. They are exceeding the average number of qualifying patients that was seen last year, per month.
The budget was anticipated to be $35 million in charges; they are now sitting at $51 million in charges. In
qualifying more patients, the System is picking up more revenues.
Director Muñoz requested an update on the work being done on the Charge Description Master (CDM). Mr.
Ayres responded that there is now one common CDM; now they have to go in and correct the
methodologies used to capture the charge. He provided examples of challenges experienced in these efforts,
including the fact that there are three separate patient accounting systems across the System that need to be
consolidated.

Report from System Chief Financial Officer (continued)
Mr. Ayres provided an update on the CareLink Policy implementation. He stated that further work needs to
be done on the communications plan; he plans to present this at the next Finance Committee Meeting.
Chairman Carvalho observed that the first policy presented for the Committee’s consideration by MedAssets
was considered to be standard, and was whittled down to be more generous in its present form. Board
Chairman Batts requested information on how the System compares to other public safety net providers,
such as Parkland, Denver and Hennepin County, with regard to amount of co-pays (including those for
Medicaid enrollees), in administration of the policy, and in the timing of when payment is expected in
relation to when services are provided1. Chairman Carvalho speculated that some of the opposition to the
policy could be due to misinformation; he noted that this policy is available through the Secretary’s office
for those who wish to review the policy in its entirety.
With regard to the report of paid Board bills (included in Attachment #2), Director O’Donnell inquired
whether vendors are being paid on time. Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance, responded
affirmatively, stating that processes have been implemented to reduce the length of time to process claims.
Mr. Ayres added that the County has been working well with the System on this issue.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, April 16, 2010
Director Ramirez, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved to accept the minutes of the Finance Committee
Meeting of April 16, 2010. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Presentation of Year-to-Date Financials through February 2010
Ms. Loving presented the Year-to-Date Lawson Financials through January 2010 (Attachment #3). The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Ms. Loving noted that as of May 10th, the County has provided the System with the final FY2009 balances,
which means they now have good beginning balances for FY2010. She stated that the most current
financial statements incorporating this information are expected to be presented at the next Committee
meeting. Chairman Carvalho added that at the next Committee meeting, the Committee will dedicate some
time to walk-through the financials, in order to get a better understanding of the issues behind the figures2.
C. Performance Improvement Implementation Services Recommendation
Mr. Ayres presented the Performance Improvement Implementation Services Recommendation (included in
Attachment #2). He noted that he recused himself from any decisions made with regard to the selection of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, as he previously worked with them in a similar project during his tenure at Grady.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Director O’Donnell inquired whether the $45 million goal included in the information was realistic. Mr.
Ayres responded that the program requires the involvement of the System leadership team in causing change
to be made. Additionally, he noted that this will be a full contingency contract.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
C. Performance Improvement Implementation Services Recommendation (continued)
William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, provided
additional information. He stated that the performance improvement assessment last year identified $80-90
million in opportunities; however, with other issues impacting the System’s finances, there was a concern
that additional opportunities would need to be identified. The fact that this will be a full contingency
contract, combined with the need for additional opportunities to be identified, proved to be a key issue and
reason for the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Sharla Roberts, representing the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance, presented information on her
office’s work with PricewaterhouseCoopers to achieve compliance with the County’s Ordinances. She
stated the original information sent in by the vendor did not reach the level of participation expected;
however she is continuing to work with the vendor to reach the level of minority and women-owned
business participation to achieve compliance.
Discussion took place on the subject of revenue cycle activities that will be included in the scope of the
contract with PricewaterhouseCoopers. Chairman Carvalho noted that the plan for the current vendor,
MedAssets, was for them to be here for three years and transition these activities to System employees.
Now the System is moving to PricewaterhouseCoopers to do a number of things, including revenue cycle
activities, in a two-year timeframe and transition. He indicated that this action is not a statement on the
current vendor’s performance; rather, the System is now moving to a more comprehensive involvement with
another company that will include this component of it.
Chairman Carvalho noted that the contingency arrangement for this type of service is typical; he stressed
that if PricewaterhouseCoopers brings in the resources they get to share in that benefit. If they do not bring
in the resources, they do not get to share in anything and the System gets the first dollars. Board Chairman
Batts inquired whether a public statement will be prepared and ready to educate and inform the public on
this subject. Mr. Foley responded affirmatively. Chairman Carvalho reiterated that this action is not a
statement about the current vendor’s services; this is a financially conducive and beneficial move for the
System to make. This is a wrap-around, full package of services that the System is seeking from
PricewaterhouseCoopers; incidental to that is displacement of vendors who are doing a piece of what this
complete package includes.
Chairman Carvalho noted the Committee could not take action on this item, as a quorum of members was no
longer present. However, an informal poll of the members present indicated that Chairman Carvalho and
Director O’Donnell agreed with the recommendation presented. Mr. Ayres stated that the next step is to
present the contract with PricewaterhouseCoopers for consideration and approval; he anticipated that this
will occur at the Board’s May 27th meeting.

D. Purchasing Performance Improvement Update
Leslie Duffy, System Director of Procurement, presented the Supply Chain Management – Performance
Improvement update (Attachment #4). The Committee reviewed the information.
Chairman Carvalho inquired whether security measures are built into the processes to make sure product
and supplies are delivered. Dr. Tedeschi responded affirmatively, stating that the Lawson System will allow
for supply chain tracking.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
E. Report of Open Market Purchases
Ms. Duffy presented the Report of Open Market Purchases (Attachment #5). The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding minority and women-owned business participation in relation to
open market purchases. Ms. Duffy responded that approximately 60% of these purchases fall into that
category.
Director O’Donnell inquired regarding the recent introduction of legislation to the Cook County Board to
lower the dollar threshold for open market purchases made without requiring County Board approval (or for
System contracts, System Board approval). Joy Wykowski, Chief of Staff to the System’s Chief Executive
Officer, responded that action has not taken place on this Ordinance Amendment; this item was referred to
the Cook County Board’s Finance Committee.
Chairman Carvalho noted that Cook County Commissioner Bridget Gainer was present; he stated that he
appreciated her dedication and thanked her for showing her interest in the System by being a frequent
meeting attendee.

Dear Members of the Finance Committee,

Iam writing on behalf of the Stroger Hospital Medical Staff t o express our concern about
current proposals for across the board cost-sharing strategies, including new co-pays for
clinical services and increases in co-pays for prescription drugs. Our concerns are threefold :
1. The purpose of cost-sharing is to reduce utilization. The published health services
research finds that cost-sharing reduces medical care that is both "high-value" (and should
be encouraged) and medical care that is assessed to be of lesser value. The experience of
increased co-payments in Medicare has been shown to have a destabilizing effect; leading
to more switching of doctors/health plans, decreasing out-patient visits, increasing
hospitalizations, and raising overall costs. Others have demonstrated disruptions of care for
those in Medicaid state plans that increased cost-sharing. The poor and those who are
sicker are consistently more sensitive t o the effects of cost-sharing, leading one group of
researchers t o write, "We believe it is reasonable to expect that higher cost sharing may
lead to worse health and may increase health disparities".
Ihave had colleagues ask me how we can have co-payments for our patients that are equal
t o the co-pay of our health insurance. I t is akin t o regressive taxation. Others worry what it
will do to our efficiency; potentially having the consequence of slowing care processes.

My colleagues and Ifear that across the board $10 co-pays and increases in pharmacy
charges will be a disincentive, most strongly felt by those who need our services the most
and who are least able to afford them.
2. With many of our patients poised t o become eligible for Medicaid coverage under health
reform, instituting across the board co-pays at this time can be predicted to hurt our future
economic health. Our survival as a vibrant institution and upholding our still-important
mission depends upon patients who are soon to be Medicaid eligible seeing tangible
improvements in service and deepening loyalties t o us as their provider of choice. The effect
of the current cost sharing proposal, and its message of disincentive, will harm the
development of these crucial loyalties. We cannot afford this. The work to develop and
implement co-pays would be a distraction from more important work we need to do to
enhance our customer service and operations.

Page 9 of 124

 3 , Should we develop a graduated, progressive co-payment scheme in line with our mission,
weneed a system t o implement the program in all our care settings. We would need to
explain it to the patients, collect (in cash, check, or credit card), t o waive when appropriate
with consistency from site to site, and accurately track. It needs t o be efficient and reliable,
and not become a new line for patients to stand in. To be done well, much developmental
work is necessary and i t would require considerable attention. We are not ready.
As a medical staff, we want to be sensitive t o opportunities for savings from waste or abuse
o f our system. We are very proud of the implications of the Dartmouth Atlas data, showing
that for Medicare patients in the last six months of life we generate lower hospital and nonhospital costs, fewer ICU bed-days, and more average days in hospice than most other
hospitals in the region. We are proud of our restricted formulary and aggressive use of
medication assistance programs that hold down pharmacy costs while maintaining excellent
care. We want to continue to work on projects that have the potential to enhance efficiency,
reduce waste, and make good quality care less costly.
We are not rejecting cost-sharing out of hand. We recognize cost-sharing that is judiciously
applied has the potential protect our mission, encouraging those most in need while
discouraging those who are part of other systems of health care or are of higher income. We
strongly believe that across the board cost-sharing a t the proposed level will be harmful
both.to patients and our health system. We urge you not t o implement it.

Respectfully,

David Goldberg, MD
President of the Medical Staff
John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital o f Cook County

We Bring Health CARE to Your Community

 Memorandum
To: CCHHS Finance Committee
From: Michael D. Ayres, CFO
Subject: Finance Committee Report April 16, 2010
Date: May 14, 2010

Revenue Report
Patient service revenue is under budget for the fifth month in a row with a year-to-date
impact of approximately $29.4 million unfavorable. The sources of the variance
continued to be the same as reported for the first four months of the year. While
admissions were at budget of 13,010 year-to-date, they are under 2009 by 355. Patient
days were 61,764 and under the current budget by 2,924 and the prior year by 3,937.
Likewise, emergency room visits at 77,459 are 6,859 under budget and the 4,824
underway years actual. The revenue analysis continues to show the most significant
decrease over the prior year is in Medicaid at 6.5% with an increase in self-pay of 4.6%.
They ongoing investigation continues to show that the majority of the year to date
revenue loss is attributable to Medicaid volume at $14.4 million, unrealized Medicaid
volume/revenue growth $5 million, Medicaid pharmacy revenue reductions of $5.5
million and to the Medicaid recruitment of $3.8 million.
A great deal of analysis is currently underway to further isolate the causes of the decline
in Medicaid revenue. In and outpatient data has been gathered for December 2007
through March 2010. The data is being analyzed to identify any changes in patient
demographics (age, national origin, race, sex, and residency) and the clinical mix of
services being provided based on Medical Diagnostic Categories (MDC). The data
(almost 3 million records) is being separated by facility and reviewed to isolate
significant triggering events. Medicaid paid claims data has been received from the state
and analyzed to compare CCHHS activity state general. Likewise, Medicaid claims
rejection data has been requested along with enrollment data for the Illinois Health
Connect program. The transition to a single Medicaid qualification provider in October
2009 is being reviewed to better understand the implication, if any, on paid claims during
the fall. The Medicaid pharmacy billing hold was corrected in March with receipt of cash
beginning to flow. Finally, management continues to review the internal data and
processes to determine whether any changes have occurred that are affecting timely
billing. As of May 10 the research has not produced any significant findings or pointed
to one or more events that triggered the downturn in Medicaid revenues that appears to
have started in September and October. Management continues to investigate and will
have prepared a detailed presentation on our findings within the next two weeks.

Page 14 of 124

 In the meantime, management continues to develop initiatives designed to increase
revenue for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. These initiatives include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Affiliation with Federally Qualified Health Centers
Development of a Managed Care Program designed to enhance Medicaid and
third-party utilization
Medicare Cost Reports Settlements of approximately $3.5 million to $4.5 million
DSH and Upper Payment Limit negotiations with state with potential value
between 500,000 and $1 million
Third-Party Rates negotiations
Design and implementation of Physician Billing Programs
Retrospective third-party payer qualification analysis
Rehabilitation services to the Veterans Administration at Oak Forest
Claims Denial management

Performance Improvement Advisory Services
In November 2009, CCHHS issue an RFP for assistance in the implementation of
recommendations received from work performed during the fall by Navigant Consulting.
CCHHS followed the prescribed method for assessment, interview and selection of
preferred vendor. As a result of this process, management recommends that
PriceWaterhouseCoopers be appointed as the prime vendor for the transformation
strategy. Attachment A is a summary of the financial benefit, key terms and deliverables
as contemplated by the parties and contained within the contract.
In summary, PWC anticipates that they can assist CCHHS in obtaining $313.8 million in
realizable cash benefits over the next 24 months. The work effort will be centered on
five specific Initiatives with detailed activity based statements of work that control the
processes. Compensation is conditioned on the identification of cash received over
predetermined baselines. The fees include all expenses and are to be paid at a ratio of 6:1
(cash to fees ) for the first $200 million in recognize benefits and 7:1 for benefits over
$200 million. Fees are capped at $50 million and payment does not begin until after $10
million of benefit has been received by the system. Any early termination fees to existing
service providers will be reimbursed to CCHHS by PWC.
The initiatives include labor and productivity, supply chain, physician funding and
ACHN operations. A significant amount of the work to be performed in these areas will
impact or be impacted by activities currently underway in the revenue cycle initiatives
managed by MedAssets. After careful analysis, management recommends that CCHHS
discontinue it's relationship with MedAssets and consolidate all transformational
activities under one vendor therefore making the revenue cycle the fifth initiative.
Please review the attached summary. Representatives from PWC will be attending the
Finance Committee meeting to answer any specific questions you may have.

 CareLink Implementation Strategy
At the April Finance Committee we continued the discussion concerning the
implementation of the CareLink strategy. At that meeting I committed to preparing
implementation plan for the strategy. Over the last month there has been ongoing
dialogue with a number of parties concerning the strategy’s implications on both
operations the patient convenience and flow. Members of hospital management,
MedAssets and Chamberlin Edmonds have had ongoing meetings of the programmatic
design necessary to initiate the program. This includes the identification of appropriate
staff, required operational processes needed for consistent application of the policies,
training programs, patient communication and the development of infrastructure and
electronic support. These requirements are presenting unanticipated challenges and I
have been unable to adequately complete the process. Therefore, I will need to delay
strategy until the June Finance Committee.
Attachment B is the Hospital Comparative Indigent Care Survey prepared last year. This
document was used to determine the structure of the CCHHS CareLink policy. I have
included it at the request of Chairman Carvalho for the Committee's review.

Lawson ERP and Time and Attendance
Cook County Department of Finance has been engaged over the last month in
determining whether the Lawson ERP will meet their information needs and become the
system of choice for all of the County operations. On Wednesday, May 12 the working
group received an update on the project status. In general, Lawson appears to meet the
counties needs. If the County implements Lawson the current proposed timeline would
have the financial and supply chain components operational by July, 2010. Human
resources, payroll and time and attendance would be operational on or about January 1,
2012. The implication for CCHHS is that the desired functionality will not be available
for 6 to 12 months after the original plan. The County staff plans proceed with their
recommendations during the May and June County Board cycles.

 Lawson Implementation
The Beginning Balance amounts, totaling $395,403,663, as reflected in
the Operating Net Assets section of the balance sheet, are still a work-inprogress; hence do not reflect true beginning balances as of December 1,
2009. This is partly due to CCHHS is still waiting for some numbers from
Cook County as part of the FYE November 30, 2009 closing process; this
in turn affects the Lawson system implementation needs to import final
JD Edwards FYE November 30, 2009 year-end balances. We expect this
issue to be resolved once we obtain the final audited financial statement
report from our external auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, to ensure
accurate and audited beginning Lawson system balances starting
December 1, 2009.

 Transmitting a Communication, dated April 14,2010 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a professional services contract
with Infrastructure Engineering, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for the Parking Lot and Entrance Control
at the Hawthorne Warehouse project. The project consists of resurfacing approximately 220,000
square feet of parking lot for approximately 500 parking spaces, design of a security guard
station with entrance control, lighting, signage and landscaping. This project was originally
approved and under contract in a previous Capital Improvement Program, but cancelled by the
Board of Commissioners due to funding issues in February 2009. As of November 2009 the
project was reapproved by the Board of Commissioners in the 2010 Capital Improvement
Program. The vendor has agreed to hold their fee to the original approved contract value minus
work completed.
Reason:

This firm is being recommended because they were the previous vendor who was
selected through the issuance of the Request for Proposal process. They began
work based upon board authorization prior to the project being cancelled. The
firm previously completed 22% of the design documents which includes: site
visits, meetings with Cook County agencies, coordination with the City of
Chicago Department of Buildings, Topographical Survey, Program Analysis
Report and Schematic Design Drawings prior to the project being cancelled last
year. In addition, this vendor is recommended because reissuing the Request for
Proposal would cause a lengthy seasonal delay in the completion of the project
and it is beneficial to the project to maintain the inherent 'lessons learned' and
program continuity.
The parking lot is in disrepair and is presenting unsightly conditions. The intent
of the project was for the paved lot to be completed before the start of heavy
construction traffic caused by the work performed from the renovation portion of
the warehouse interior and the exterior wall repair projects.
The Hawthorne Warehouse is located in a hig
security of the grounds would be significantly i
high mast lighting and entrance control. This is pecially critical durin election
periods as the grounds are accessible 24 hours
