Legislative Updates - Tobacco 21
Tom O’Donnell briefly advised the status of Tobacco 21 efforts locally. CCBH was instrumental in
assisting the City of Euclid Council in the passage of its legislation to raise the age for sale of tobacco
products to 21. Meanwhile, similar legislation is currently pending on the Cleveland Hts. Council
agenda but there are some nuances between the Cleveland Hts. version and the Euclid version. Rick
Novickis pointed out that there are challenges to getting different communities to pass the same
legislation. Currently we are making every effort to try to have the legislation in different
communities be consistent.
