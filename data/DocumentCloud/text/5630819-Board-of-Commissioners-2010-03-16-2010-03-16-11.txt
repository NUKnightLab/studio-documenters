EXPLANATION
Related Midwest, Heartland Housing and Quest Development were selected as the result of an
RFP issued by the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”) and the court-appointed Gautreaux
Receiver, Daniel E. Levin and The Habitat Company (“Receiver”), for redevelopment of the
ABLA site into a mixed-income community.
The development of a community park was a critical component in the community approval of
the Roosevelt Square Redevelopment Plan. On behalf of the CHA, the developer purchased
Riis School from the Chicago Public Schools in July 2007 for the appraised market value of
$2,500,000 for future development of residential units and a 1.1 acre park for the Roosevelt
Square community. The CHA is legally obligated to the Chicago Park District (“CPD”) under
the 2003 FOSCO Park IGA to provide this land for development of the 1.1 acre park. Through
acquisition of this site, CHA will fulfill its obligation to CPD and the site will be available for
the Roosevelt Square community park.
The subject property is approximately 1.414 acres located at 1109 south Throop Street, just south
of Taylor Street (North), Grenshaw Street (South), South Lytle Street (East) and South Throop
Street (West). The appraised fair market value for the land is $1,970,000. The full 1.414 acre
site is slated for development of 21 townhome style units in addition to the new 1.1 acre
community park. The community park will house a group of seven, Works Progress
Administration (“WPA”) era animal sculptures by renowned artist Edgar Miller, originally

 installed at the Jane Addams Homes that are currently in storage awaiting restoration and
reinstallation. One of the sculptures has been restored and will be on exhibit at the Merchandise
Mart as part of the History Coming Home show scheduled for February 16, 2010, in hopes of
generating publicity to assist with fundraising activities for the remaining sculptures.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to: 1) Submit
an Acquisition Application to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development,
2) Enter into a Purchase Agreement with RS Homes II LLC for a certain portion of land at the
Roosevelt Square development and 3) Execute such other documents as necessary to implement
the foregoing.
