PROPOSED RESOLUTION
PROTECTING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARD AND
SUPPORTING INCREASED FUNDING LEVELS
WHEREAS, women need access to safe, affordable, and comprehensive reproductive health care throughout their
lives, including screening for cancer and sexually transmitted infections, contraceptive services, abortion care,
prenatal care and labor and delivery services; and
WHEREAS, reproductive health is a vital component of a woman’s overall health, and reproductive freedom is
vital to a woman’s safety, well-being and ability to participate equally in society; and
WHEREAS, on January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a historic and landmark decision, ruled in Roe v.
Wade that the U.S. Constitution safeguards a woman’s ability to make her own personal medical decisions about
when or whether to have children; and
Page 14 of 176

 WHEREAS, that decision has allowed women to participate more fully in society, saved lives, and strengthened
families and we must always guard against efforts to deliberately erode the availability and affordability of abortion
and undermine the protections provided by Roe v. Wade; and
WHEREAS, the majority of Americans continue to support safe legal abortion; and
WHEREAS, Federal and State laws that place obstacles in the paths of women seeking abortion care take away the
ability of those women to make decisions and threaten the health of families; and
WHEREAS, one (1) such restriction is the Hyde Amendment, passed by Congress on September 30, 1976, which
for nearly thirty-nine (39) years has impeded access to abortion care for low-income women enrolled in Medicaid;
and
WHEREAS, Medicaid coverage for abortion care has a significant effect on low-income women’s ability to decide
to end an unwanted pregnancy, and in the absence of such coverage many women are unable to obtain an abortion;
and
WHEREAS, many women in Cook County, including State and Federal employees, obtain insurance coverage
through other public insurance programs that also restrict coverage for abortion; and
WHEREAS, all women should have insurance coverage for comprehensive reproductive health care, including
abortion care, to ensure that their economic status or the source of their insurance coverage does not affect important
health care decisions or access; and
WHEREAS, millions of women nationally, and hundreds of thousands in Illinois and Cook County, are subject to
these inequitable policies; and
WHEREAS, public health insurance should cover all of a woman’s options when she is facing an unintended
pregnancy, so that she is able to make a real decision about what is best for her and her family; and
WHEREAS, Cook County provides important support for many women to ensure that they have access to
comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortion, but regardless of the resources dedicated by Cook
County, bans on coverage for abortion continue to harm many women; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that funding of comprehensive reproductive health care be increased and that abortion
be covered as part of comprehensive reproductive health care in all public insurance programs to ensure that services
are accessible for women who are enrolled in such programs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County call upon Federal and State elected officials to maintain the protections established by Roe v. Wade
for access to comprehensive reproductive health care and undo restrictions that have been placed on those
protections; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
call for increased Federal and State funding for comprehensive reproductive health care and to reinstate coverage
for abortion services for women enrolled in public insurance programs.

The vendor has met the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
Summary: Amend the authorized amount for the below contracts awarded for the Countywide Job Order
Contract (JOC) Program. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a
multitude of repair/maintenance and construction project with a single, competitively bid contract.
The JOC
process involved first selecting a vendor pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement process,
and identifying projects for such selected vendors. The contractors were found to be the lowest, responsive and
responsible bidder through a competitive bid process in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
On 3/20/2013, The Board of Commissioners approved contracts with the selected contractors listed below for the
Countywide Job Order Contracting (JOC) Program. The contracts are a two (2) year base term with two (2)
one-year renewal options from the date of execution, 3/20/2013 to 3/19/2015.
The Department of Capital Planning and Policy, the Department of Facilities Management, the Department
of
Transportation and Highways, and the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer request authorization to renew one
(1) one-year renewal options from the date of execution; 3/19/2015 to 3/19/2016; and authorize an increase to the
JOC Contractors contract authority by $12,000,000.00.
The County is under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and is only obligated to pay JOC contractors
when the construction work is procured through the JOC program. The amendment will allow the County to
extend the utilization of JOC contracts to facilitate all departments’ upcoming projects through the base contract
period with a one (1) one-year renewal option.

communities and engaged in pro-social interventions in lieu of detention. The contract provides a wide range of
respite care, including educational, therapeutic and recreational programming, emergency shelter beds and

this program. Since the beginning of the program, more than 2,500 minors have received DRP services. In

This contract was extended with the approval of the Cook County Board in 2014; this increase and extension

To Account(s): 335-260, $83,200.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $83,200.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds in
order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was
the
balance 30 days prior to that date?
1/30/2015, $0.00, $0.00
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts that
were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 335-240, Printing and Publishing, was identified as the source of transfer of funds for the purchase
of
Personal Issue Traffic Tickets for the City of Chicago and Suburban Traffic Tickets. The placement
of
a
supplemental order of tickets in 2014 with FY 2014 funds while awaiting the bid and award of a new traffic ticket
contract, reduced the need for a larger order of tickets in 2015. Therefore, as a result of the supplemental order of
tickets, we anticipate purchasing a reduced quantity of additional tickets in FY 2015.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred, delayed,
or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the account that
funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally budgeted
in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
As a result of supplemental tickets ordered in 2014, we anticipate that an additional FY 2015 order for traffic
tickets will be less than previously anticipated, hence the availability of funds in Account 335-240
for
transfer.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER 46 OF THE COOK COUNTY CODE OF ORDINANCES
CONCERNING “LAW ENFORCEMENT” BY ADDING A NEW SECTION 46-38
PROHIBITING THE USE OF CHOKE HOLDS BY
COOK COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a Home Rule Unit of Government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois Constitution,
Article VII, Section 6; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform any
function relating to its government and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of the public
health, safety, morals and welfare; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Police Officers and those public servants under the direction of the Cook County Sheriff
strive to maintain a courteous and professional demeanor when dealing with the public, in addition to and including
individuals detained in Cook County Jail and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff trains his officers to select the appropriate level of force based on a subject’s
actions, and to modify their selection of options as the subject offers less or greater resistance; and
WHEREAS, choke holds are largely ineffective and create the potential for a subject to panic and react with greater
resistance than he or she otherwise might deploy during an officer restraint; and
WHEREAS, the children in the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, due to their ages, are not as likely to
appreciate the consequences of impulsively resistant behavior in the same manner as an adult inmate; and
WHEREAS, the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County intend to codify the Cook County
Sheriff’s commitment to a progressive and reasonable escalation and de-escalation of officer-applied force into the
County Codes and Ordinances, and further intend to expressly prohibit the use of choke holds by Cook County
police officers as well as any private security personnel employed by Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
OF COOK COUNTY:

herein.

enacted as follows:
Sec. 46-38 Policy on Use of Force- choke holds prohibited
(a) Members of the Cook County Sheriff’s Department and Cook County police officers as well as any private
security personnel employed by Cook County shall use an amount of force reasonably necessary based on the
totality of the circumstances to perform a lawful task, effect an arrest, overcome resistance, control a subject or
protect themselves or others from injury. Circumstances that may govern the reasonableness of using a particular
force option include but are not limited to: (1) whether the subject poses an immediate threat to the safety of
officers or others; and (2) whether the subject is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.
(b) After gaining control of a subject, members of the Cook County Sheriff’s Department and Cook County
police officers as well as any private security personnel employed by Cook County shall:
(1) Avoid sitting, kneeling or standing on a subject’s chest which may result in chest compression, thereby
reducing the subject’s ability to breathe;
(2) Position the subject in a manner to allow free breathing and whenever feasible, avoid placing the
subject on his or her stomach;
(3) Monitor an arrestee until transported to a secure location; and
(4) Seek medical attention for an arrestee who has injuries or illnesses consistent with Sheriff’s Department
Policy Directives.
(c) No Cook County Sheriff’s Department, Cook County police officer or private security personnel
employed by Cook County shall apply a choke hold in the performance of his or her duties unless faced with a
situation in which the use of deadly force is justified under applicable law. A choke hold shall include but is not
limited to, any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air.
(d) For purposes of this Section the following terms shall have the following meaning:
“Police Officer” means any person who by virtue of his or her public employment is vested by law with a duty
to maintain public order or make arrests for offenses, whether that duty extends to all offenses or is limited to
specific offenses.
“Private Security Personnel” means a person or persons acting in the capacity of his or her employment by a
private contractor who engages in the business of providing a private security officer, watchman, patrol, guard dog,
canine odor detection or a similar service by any other title or name on a contractual basis for another person, firm,
corporation, or other entity for a fee or other consideration and performing one (1) or more of the following
functions:
(1) The prevention or detection of intrusion, entry, theft, vandalism, abuse, fire or trespass on Cook County
governmental property or private property within jurisdiction of Cook County law enforcement;
(2) The prevention, observation or detection of any unauthorized activity on Cook County governmental
property or private property within jurisdiction of Cook County law enforcement;
(3) The protection of persons authorized to be on the premises of the person, firm, or other entity for which
the security contractor contractually provides security services;
(4) The prevention of the misappropriation of the concealment of goods, money, stocks, bonds, notes,
documents or papers;
(5) The control, regulation, or direction of the movement of the public for the time specifically required
for the protection of the property owned or controlled by the client; and
(6) The protection of individuals from bodily harm or death (body guard functions).
Effective date: This Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ASKING THAT THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION AND COMED - AN EXELON
COMPANY, MOVE QUICKLY TO ADDRESS KEY DEFICIENCIES IN ITS CHARITABLE
DONATION POLICY
WHEREAS, high utility rates disproportionately impact Cook County residents with low to moderate
levels of income; and
WHEREAS, recent media assertions that the charitable contributions ComEd - An Exelon Company, funds
with ratepayer money are political in nature should be deeply troubling to all those in Cook County
concerned with the rights of consumers; and
WHEREAS, according to a lengthy investigative report undertaken by the Chicago Tribune, ComEd - An
Exelon Company, has been consistently using the fund created by the small portion of every customer’s
bill that is set aside for charitable donations, to make monetary contributions to a number of politically
connected organizations; and
WHEREAS, as a matter of equity, a utility should not steer funds in a manner that directly or indirectly
benefits public officials charged with regulating that utility; and
WHEREAS, ComEd - An Exelon Company’s charitable donation policy as currently constituted may place
a utility customer in the position of inadvertently donating to a cause that the customer does not support;
and
WHEREAS, in the interests of transparency and accountability, the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC)
should at minimum advise or require ComEd - An Exelon Company, to provide its customers with a full,
accessible accounting of all of the donations it has made with ratepayer dollars.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that it is in the best interests of Cook County residents and utility customers that the Illinois
Commerce Commission (ICC) move swiftly and decisively to assist ComEd - An Exelon Company in
reforming its policy on charitable donations; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that ComEd - An Exelon Company, provide a report to the Illinois
Commerce Commission (ICC) and the Cook County Board of Commissioners, in addition to its customers
at the earliest possible date detailing its plans to address the serious concerns that have been raised about
its charitable donation policy; and
