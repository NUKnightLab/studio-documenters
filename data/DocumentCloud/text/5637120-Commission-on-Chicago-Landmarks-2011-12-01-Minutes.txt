The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

2.

401 S. State
(The Second Leiter Building – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed non-illuminated vinyl sign 50’-long x 27.5’-tall for “Robert Morris
University” on the east (rear) façade of the building facing the alley.

Action:

Approved as submitted (vote was 3 in favor with Commissioner Smith
abstaining)

618 S. Michigan
(Historic Michigan Boulevard District – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of a non-historic metal-and-glass façade with a new
glass curtain wall with butt-glazed joints and ceramic-frit pattern for existing
10-story building.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed insulated glazing unit (Old Castle with PPG Starphire outer
lite and Guardian Solar Ban 63 inner lite), for the new curtain wall and the
proposed masonry wall color (to match Benjamin Moore 986 Smoky Ash)
is approved;
2. The full-scale digitally imprinted ceramic frit pattern of the image of the
historic façade, removed in its entirety in the 1950s, is approved as
proposed;
3. Given the particular situation, with the existing masonry wall location and
structural and code requirements of installing a new curtain wall system,
the location of the new glass curtain wall plane, proposed to project

 approximately 13” over the Michigan Avenue property line, is approved.
However, any reasonable modifications to the proposed curtain wall system
to reduce the projection into the public way is encouraged;
4. Enlarged section and plan details at the typical masonry openings, as well
as at the bottom, top, sides of the curtain wall façade shall be included in
the permit plans; and,
5. The applicant is intending to do additional mock-ups during the final
design and construction phases of the project. Historic Preservation staff
shall review and approve any future mock-ups and any minor changes to
exterior wall materials, frit pattern, finishes, and colors. A sample of the
sealant shall be reviewed and approved by staff prior to order and
installation. Any major changes to the proposal will come back for review
and approval of the Permit Review Committee.
In addition, the Committee found that the amount of demolition involved with
the project does not trigger the requirements of Section 2-120-825 governing
the demolition of 40% or more of buildings in landmark districts.

3.

2436 N. Orchard
(Arlington-Deming District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed rehabilitation of single-family residence including new concrete
foundation, reconstruction of an existing enclosed front porch, and a rear
addition.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. A structural engineer’s report and drawings shall be submitted with the
permit application certifying that the building can be raised safely,
addressing how the historic building should be supported, braced and
protected during the demolition of the perimeter walls below the first floor,
and the excavation and construction of the new foundation. Structural
details of any required supports or bracing shall be included with the permit
plans. The report should include recommended measures and sequencing
plan;
2. As submitted, the existing height of the building (36’-6’) shall be
maintained while accommodating the new concrete foundation;
3. Any structural repair work proposed to the existing roof to remain shall
maintain the existing ridge and eave heights and roof slopes (i.e., by
aligning the top of any new structural member with the top of the existing
structural member);
4. Proposed window details shall be submitted with the permit application;
5. The proposed substitute materials (cellular PVC) for the front porch and
side entrance shall have a smooth finish and be painted; and,
6. As proposed, the existing wood siding, trim, and cornice shall be retained
and repaired wherever possible. Should areas of replacement be required
Historic Preservation staff shall be notified to view the condition and
approve any areas of replacement. Replacement wood siding shall match
the size, profile, and appearance of historic wood siding.
