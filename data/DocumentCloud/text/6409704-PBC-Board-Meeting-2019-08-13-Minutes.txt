work with the Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Park District to obtain additional lighting
so that sporting events could be played during the evening hours. Kathryn Pensack provided
comments regarding the need for more energy efficient buildings as well as space and size
efficiencies. She also expressed appreciation to the Public Building Commission for the
opportunity to speak with some of its designers.
Next, Commissioner Sax in his capacity as Acting Chair presented to the Board of
Commissioners for consideration of approval the minutes of the rescheduled regular meeting
held on July 16, 2019. The reading of said minutes, which had previously been distributed, was
dispensed with and upon motion duly made and seconded, the minutes of the July 16, 2019
meeting were unanimously approved.
The next item on the agenda was a report by Commissioner Maldonado regarding the
Administrative Operations (AO) Committee meeting held on August 8, 2019 which is
summarized as follows:

The next item on the agenda was a report by Executive Director Sánchez regarding
regular reports, development status and other matters. She presented photographic displays
regarding the Commission’s continuing public engagement with community organizations. Chief
of Development Giderof was depicted on a slide providing a presentation to HACIA’s Monthly
Membership Meeting which Executive Director Sánchez also attended. The presentation
included an overview of the Commission’s projects and an explanation of its role in the
development process. Individuals were offered the opportunity to learn about the Public Building
Commission while promoting business opportunities through the networking events. Also, on
July 23, 2019, the Metropolitan Family Services North Center hosted a community hiring event
to provide local residents with an opportunity to connect with the Commission’s contractors.
Several current construction management teams attended the hiring event and accepted
applications from residents for employment on the Commission’s projects to ensure participation
in building local communities. Executive Director Sánchez expressed pride that Public Building
Commission projects were creating meaningful and significant economic opportunities for the
neighborhoods in which they were developed.
Finally, Executive Director Sánchez advised that the Whitney M. Young Jr. Branch
Library, which opened earlier this year, was awarded LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green
Building Council. The Library Project was also recently featured on the cover of the Chicago
Architect Magazine in an article entitled, “Library Projects Meet Diverse Needs.”
At the conclusion of the discussion, the report by the Executive Director was accepted.

Agreement with People’s Gas for utility work at the Dulles School located at 6311 South Calumet.
