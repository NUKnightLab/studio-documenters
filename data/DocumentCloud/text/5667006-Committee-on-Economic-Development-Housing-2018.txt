III. Approval of Minutes
IV. Agenda Items
Ordinances

10496-18

An Ordinance of the County of Allegheny, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
authorizing the conveyance of the County of Allegheny’s interest in one parcel of land
located on Wilhelm Avenue in the Township of South Park known as Block 564-C,
Lot 267 (see attached map) to Sunrise Baptist Church.

Sponsors: Chief Executive

At the request of the Chair, the clerk read the title of the bill and Mr. Hurley summarized
its provisions, noting that the provisions of this bill and the other on the committee's
agenda for consideration (10497-18) are similar insofar as they are three party taxing
body sales, with each body to receive one third of the sale price and both other bodies
having already approved the sale.
Mr. Hurley noted that the sale contemplated by 10496-18 is a sale to a church, so the
property in question may or may not be taxable after the sale.
In response to a question from Ms. Means, Mr. Hurley noted that the parcel is 9000
square feet in surface area, to be used for overflow parking.
A motion was made by Catena, seconded by DeMarco , that this matter be
Affirmatively Recommended. The motion carried by a unanimous vote.

Sponsors: Chief Executive

At the Chair's request, the clerk read the title of the bill and Mr. Hurley summarized its
provisions, noting that the buyer of the property owns the parcels on either side, and that
the transaction envisioned is mechancially very similar to the three taxing body sale
contemplated under Bill No. 10496-18.
