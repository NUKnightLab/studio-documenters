to provide services in the areas of early childhood development, out-of-school time for youth, senior
services and family programming. In 2015, CHA and DFSS will provide the following initiatives:
Early Childhood/Family Services: The Early Childhood and Family Services initiative includes early
childhood and adult literacy services. DFSS will continue to partner with several organizations to
provide targeted programs focusing on: 1) adult literacy and GED services; 2) educational
enhancement for Head Start youth; 3) summer youth programs with focus on peacemaking and
personal growth; and 4) enhanced services to teen moms through a home visiting model. Out of
School Time: DFSS will continue to offer out-of-school time activities for CHA youth including after
school, summer and school vacation time programming. These quality programs offer youth a
structured environment to participate in academic enrichment, arts and culture, computer science
technology, sports fitness and career exploration activities. Through out of school initiatives, CHA and
DFSS will collaborate to identify high-need communities and/or gaps in services and will implement
appropriate, targeted programs in those areas. Golden Diner: The Golden Diner Program provides
meals that meet the recommended dietary allowances for older adults to help them stay healthy, and
addresses isolation by providing the venue for socialization and physical activities for seniors to
engage in before and after meals are served. DFSS covers the costs for meals provided through the
