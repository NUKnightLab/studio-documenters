Good morning,

16

touch base about tentative 2018 meeting dates.

17

As of right now we would like to schedule

18

quarterly meetings for 2018.

19

been working very hard with your staff and

20

assistants to get these dates that -- and get

21

dates that work for everyone.

22

Just quickly, sorry, we wanted to

Patty Dominguez has

Right now I think there may still be

23

an outstanding issue with the February 20th date.

24

So this is just a tentative.

So we're still

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

working around some schedules and trying to make

2

sure that everybody can make it and get it on

3

their calendar as far in advance as possible.

4

These are dates we're looking at right

5

now:

Tuesday, February 20th; Thursday, June 28;

6

Thursday, September 27th and Wednesday, December

7

12th.

8

dates and as soon as we can finalize them, we

9

will let you know.

We will continue to update these tentative

10

But as of now these are the dates

11

we're looking at.

12

particularly problematic, please have your staff

13

get in touch with me or Patty directly and we'll

14

make sure that we try and get the schedule that

15

works for everyone.

16

If any of them are

So thank you, again, everyone, for

17

attending today's meeting.

our last few board of directors meetings we've

our team at CIT.

I know I have been thanking

2

them at every meeting, but we just keep getting

3

more and more projects and we have asked a great

4

deal of the staff and team at CIT.

5

want to give an additional thank you as we

6

continue to grow and continue to get projects

7

that provide economic development to

8

neighborhoods and make better use of the City's

assets, assist City departments in providing more

and he sat on a panel and shared information

about the work that we're doing at CIT and the

23

work that he's done.

Not just in

these invitations to give us an opportunity to

share what we're doing, but also learn from

others in the space and share best practices.

I was

So as far as a personnel update goes,

7

we continue to have five full-time employees

including myself.

fellows, Sean Dowd and Tiffany Kwak who you've

10

met at previous meetings.

11

with us and have been great assets.

12

They continue to work

I also want to formally introduce

13

Phoebe Downey who I wrote to you about and she

14

recently joined our team as a project associate.

15

And she comes to us from an organization where

16

she has done a tremendous amount of urban

17

mobility work as she has her Master's in Public

18

Administration from the University of Pittsburgh

19

and her undergrad degree from Johns Hopkins.

20

In her short time with us she's been a

21

tremendous asset, and I hope you'll take the time

22

to get to know her and hopefully you'll like her

23

as much as we do.

24

our office.

She's been a great addition to

In order to right size this, we may in

2

2018 add one more additional person to our staff.

And -- but I will update you on that of whether

that will move forward.

6

that comes to pass.

And we'll also do some

I would be remissed if I did not give

8

a special thank you to Patty Dominguez who

9

through all of our budget planning and managing

10

our relationships with our financial vendors and

11

assisting in our changes in accounting, handling

12

our budget and insurance renewals.

13

to helping manage all of our projects, Patty is

14

just a tremendous asset, and I know you all work

15

with her from time to time as well and so I want

16

to give a special thank you to her.

17

In addition

Also, I want to make sure I

18

acknowledge Hilda Renteria and Yesenia Hernandez

19

who are our accounting team from Prado &

20

Renteria.

21

last meeting that they have moved to our

22

accounting function and we are thrilled that they

23

are working with us in that function.

24

have had an excellent transition to their

And so as you know we also entered

3

into an agreement with Benford Brown, a certified

4

MBE and WBE firm, to handle our independent

5

auditing function.

to introduce you -- I'll be introducing them to

7

you in 2018 when it comes time for our audit.

On our proposed 2018 budget we
continue to accomplish a great deal with our very

modest budget.

operations to three different locations

throughout the City and we are in the final

stages of that deal.

information about that with you today.

19

In the past year as you know we

We are managing the

We'll share more

We're managing the procurement for the

20

Joint Public Safety Training Academy and we have

21

launched the RFQ for O'Hare Express.

22

accomplished a great deal in the past 12 months,

23

and we continue to partner with the City to

24

provide these services for pennies on the dollar

So we've

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

8

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

compared to what the City would pay private firms

2

with the analysis, advising and document

3

production and other services that we're

4

providing.

5

As you know I try and focus on

6

prudently managing our expenses to provide the

7

City with the greatest value for the funds that

8

we use.

9

You've all seen the budget and the

10

budget documents and had the opportunity to

11

review.

12

will ask for a conditional approval of this

13

budget.

14

Are there any questions?

MS. HUBBARD:

And if not I

Is there a specific branch

15

that contributed to the decrease in revenue or is

16

it just general?

17

MS. DARLING:

That's just through 2017.

It

18

will be -- we have since received that so we have

19

1.3 million as agreed to with the City.

20
21

Any other questions?

Then I will ask

for that conditional approval, please.

22

MR. ZARATE:

Motion to approve.

23

MS. CAFARO:

Second.

MS. DARLING:

Okay.

The ayes have it.
Thank you.

Now, we'll

7

move into the fun part for the project updates.

8

Let the record reflect that Jorge Ramirez has

9

joined us.

Thank you, Jorge.

10

MR. RAMIREZ:

This is time for the bonus.

11

MS. DARLING:

So first we are going to talk

12

about the O'Hare Express System Project.

13

last few board meetings I've mentioned that Tom

14

Budescu has been sitting on the working group

15

instituted by the City and Mayor Emanuel last

16

year to look at the feasibility of the O'Hare --

17

an O'Hare Express System with the goal of

18

improving transportation between O'Hare Airport

19

and downtown Chicago to provide faster, direct

20

and for reliable service for the citizens and

21

travelers of the City.

22

In the

And so the result of that working

23

group was an RFQ that was released by the CIT

24

last week.

And the objective is to provide
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

10

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

service that takes 20 minutes or less and costs

2

less than using a ride share service or a cab

3

between downtown and O'Hare.

4

The RFQ has received a great deal of

5

attention.

It has been downloaded many times.

6

There is a very large contingent of people who

7

have already responded positively and wish to

8

attend our pre-submittal conference which is

9

taking place on December 20th, so the week of

10

Christmas.

11

that are coming to that.

12

And we have a huge group of people

The statement of qualifications will

13

be due on January 24th.

14

respondents a short list will be selected in

15

coordination with City -- the City of Chicago.

16

And after that if there is a short-listed group

17

of respondents and there is market interest, then

18

an RFP will be issued to move the project

19

forward.

20
21
22

And from those

So, Tom, do you want to discuss
anything specific on the overview of the RFQ?
MR. BUDESCU:

Sure.

I mean, you know, we

23

can't go into more detail than what's in the

24

document, of course, now that the procurement has
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

11

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

commenced; but the project scope is basically at

2

the very minimum a downtown terminal in the

3

O'Hare terminal as well as one maintenance

4

facility likely to be near O'Hare.

5

The City and the CIT remain open to

6

multiple potential alignments.

We've outlined

7

three alignments that the City has studied with

8

its consultant that we've worked with as part of

9

the working group; but we're not tied to those

10

potential alignments and we're open to whatever

11

surface or subsurface alignment that ultimately

12

proves most effective and efficient in financing

13

and delivering the project.

14

The financing will be expected to come

15

from the private party selected through the

16

procurement process and their funding will solely

17

come from project specific revenue.

18

revenue, advertising; but the City does not plan

19

on contributing any public funds towards the

20

design, build, financing operations or

21

maintenance of the project.

22

MS. HUBBARD:

So BareBox

Can I just ask a few

23

questions?

Is this -- if the project is

24

successful in moving forward, will it be totally
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

12

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1
2

separate from CTA, RTA?
MR. BUDESCU:

It would be expected to have a

3

concession agreement with a long-term in a -- I

4

don't know if it ends up being 30 years --

5

MS. HUBBARD:

Because they use their rail in

6

some capacity or will it be a separate rail

7

altogether?

8

MR. BUDESCU:

It would probably --

9

MS. HUBBARD:

And if you can't answer,

10
11
12

that's fine.
MR. BUDESCU:

Yeah.

No, the answer is they

will probably use a separate rail.

Right.

13

MS. HUBBARD:

Okay.

14

MR. BUDESCU:

We don't want to interfere

15

with existing CTA services.

16

City contract and it will be operating privately

17

by the concessionaire; but in coordination with

18

the City and all existing transit, rail and

19

commuter rail offerings to make sure that no

20

interference is caused to the existing services.

21

MS. HUBBARD:

And so it will be a

And then just a second

22

question.

The huge amount of responses that

23

you've seen, this subject has come up in the

24

past.

Is this different from in the past or is
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

13

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

it always a lot of interest and, you know, not

2

being able to -- I'm just curious because we've

3

got tremendous response to this which is very,

4

very good.

5

something different this time.

6

technology firms are more able bring this to

7

market.

8

but I'm just wondering has the interest always

9

been this great.

10

And I'm just wondering if it's
It could be that

It could be something as simple as that,

MS. DARLING:

Well, we have been very

11

fortunate that there has been excellent interest

12

in the projects and the procurements that we've

13

worked on.

14

different level.

15

national attention and I think that --

16
17
18

This is sort of at a little bit of a
I think it's receiving some

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

She is saying relative to

efforts in the past to -MS. DARLING:

Oh, I think -- yeah, I think

19

that -- I think as you mentioned when it's been

20

looked at in the past, I think we're at a

21

different point in technology right now.

22

this is a market sounding to determine if there

23

is additional kinds of capabilities.

24

there is the ability to do it and the financial

And

And if

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

14

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

wherewithal of respondents to participate and the

2

working group and the City and the CIT believe

3

now -- believes now may be that moment.

4

that's what makes it appropriate for the market

5

sounding that we're doing right now.

And

6

MR. RAMIREZ:

I mean -- Leslie, if I could.

7

MS. DARLING:

Of course.

8

MR. RAMIREZ:

I mean, this is something

9

that, I mean, all of us probably have some level

10

of awareness for this; but this is something that

11

has been tried over and over and over again.

12

the last few times that we took a look at it,

13

there wasn't Infrastructure Trust, there wasn't

14

the technology that's out there now.

15

financing instruments are all -- they're all

16

different.

17

that's --

But

The

So, I mean, I think that's --

18

MS. HUBBARD:

The difference.

19

MR. RAMIREZ:

Yeah, exactly.

So I don't

20

know.

21

know, I ever was; but this could be a big deal

22

for the City.

23
24

I mean, I'm as optimistic now as, you

Look at some of what's happening
around the world with respect to connecting, you
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

15

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

know, the airport with the city center.

2

had nothing but success.

3

in other countries and we can pull that off here

4

and it would be amazing, but it's not a -- it's

5

got to be the right deal.

6

They've

It's worked out great

So hopefully this will be -- it will

7

attract enough folks with enough creativity.

8

just with the engineering, but the finance and it

9

would be great.

10

MR. SILVERS:

11

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

12

MR. SILVERS:

Hello?

13

MS. DARLING:

Damon, go ahead.

14

MR. SILVERS:

All right.

Not

Leslie or Kurt.
Go ahead, Damon.

Hi.

Great.

Thank you.

15

I want to follow up on what Jorge was saying.

16

want to echo I think what a number of people have

17

said which is both from the perspective of what

18

Chicago needs and the role that the Trust plays

19

as a kind of -- as a leader in innovative

20

infrastructure financing for public purposes.

21

I

I think that this is a key project.

22

When the -- in my day job at the AFL-CIO I engage

23

in national infrastructure policy.

24

that I make over and over again is that it's a

One point

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

16

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

real problem in the United States that our major

2

cities are not effective -- are not connected

3

with their airports in ways that are competitive

4

with how bigger cities are around the world.

5

this is obviously an effort to address that issue

6

in Chicago.

7

And

And by the way, Chicago is better

8

connected already than LA and New York are in

9

that there is rail service to O'Hare.

It's just

10

not -- it's just not anywhere near as fast as

11

what you would experience in London or Paris or

12

in the major cities of Europe or in Asia.

13

The -- I want to just make a couple of

14

remarks about the financing issues that are

15

embedded in this RFP.

16

me from it and maybe someone can explain this.

17

It's a little unclear to

To the extent that this project

18

involves the actual creation of physical assets,

19

what the intention is as to who ultimately owns

20

those assets.

21

physical assets.

22

leases and so forth.

23

question that people might be worth clarifying.

24

And maybe there aren't any actual
I can't tell.

Maybe it's all

But I think that's a

Secondly, as is always the case no
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

17

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

matter how you do things there is a cost of

2

capital issue here.

3

attention in particular to Section 2.2.4 on

4

Federal Financing Applications.

5

And I would call the Board's

To the extent that in the end whatever

6

the financing structure is and however the

7

ownership is structured; in the end if it's

8

possible to get access to tax-exempt and federal

9

financing, that will obviously get you very close

10
11

to a very low cost of capital.
If instead what's happening here is

12

that people are bidding and the credit is being

13

structured based on the cash flows of the project

14

itself plus whatever the credit is of the

15

contractor, then the credit worthiness of the

16

contractor is going to be a very big deal.

17

This is going to flow back to, you

18

know, this is going to flow back into the

19

economics of the project as a whole both for the

20

users and potentially ultimately for the City.

21

So, you know, it seems to me that the

22

Board should pay very close attention to the

23

various bids that come in here and what their

24

real cost of capital is.

What both in terms of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

18

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

their ability -- the extent to which they're

2

accessing very low cost public debt, A.

3

the embedded cost of capital that you will see in

4

the project as a whole when you look at all the

5

cash flows coming in and out.

6

And I want to be clear.

And, B,

I'm saying

7

this not to suggest that there is a problem here,

8

but to suggest that this is something that we as

9

a board need to watch very carefully.

10

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Damon, when -- I

11

appreciate the focus as you have had on the

12

financing issues that are sort of helpful in all

13

the projects we've looked at here.

14

of speak to low cost public financing, presumably

15

we're talking more than just the credit of the

16

City of Chicago which one would argue isn't low

17

cost public financing at the moment.

18

MR. SILVERS:

19

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

When you sort

No, I know.
And so I think -- I think

20

it would just be helpful offline to make sure

21

that Leslie and Tom and the team have the full

22

breadth of knowledge and understanding that you

23

do relative to what all of those options are.

24

MR. SILVERS:

If you don't mind let me just

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

19

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

clarify.

2

City faces.

3

project will largely stand no matter who does it,

4

whether the City does it or whether it's done

5

from a PC structure as envisioned here.

6

of capital for this project is going to stand as

7

-- as the RFP says it will on the economics of

8

the project itself.

9

two things are going to matter behind that.

10

I am well aware of the issues that the
I think the -- this thing is -- this

Right.

The cost

But then -- but then

One is the contractor, the

11

concessionaire, what are they?

12

credit like?

13

like meaning they may set up a vehicle for this,

14

but behind that vehicle is going to be some

15

parent company.

16

What's their

And what's their implicit credit

And then the other is can the Trust --

17

and I think this is just absolutely critical.

18

Can the Trust working with the concessionaire get

19

the -- get this financing structure to get access

20

to tax-exempt financing or federal financing

21

because then you've got the real low cost of

22

capital.

23

credit.

24

It's not dependent on the City's

MR. BUDESCU:

I think -- so a couple of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

20

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

things.

Maybe first I'll tackle your first

2

question about who owns the underlying assets.

3

And I think one thing that we should clarify is

4

what we've issued is a request for qualifications

5

and not a request for proposals yet.

6

we're seeking right now is not bids and proposals

7

with the cost of capital and any assumptions on

8

the underlying contractual terms, but rather for

9

interested parties to demonstrate their

And so what

10

qualifications to design, build, finance, operate

11

and maintain the project.

12

To that we will subsequently issue an

13

RFP that provides greater detail on exactly the

14

financing structure and the contractual structure

15

with the draft form of contract.

16

would be the City's preference ultimately if

17

achievable to own the underlying assets during

18

the term of the concessions with the hand back at

19

the culmination of the project term, but I think

20

ultimately we want to remain flexible at this

21

time to see what the feedback we get about what's

22

feasible and achievable and what's not if we're

23

not contributing any public funds towards the

24

project.

I think it

I think there is a reason to be a
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

21

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

little more flexible than you would be otherwise.

2

And then to the federal financing

3

portion, we've worked -- we discussed in the

4

working group of the TIF and private activity

5

bond programs which are probably the most

6

applicable federally subsidized debt instruments

7

that would be applicable to this project.

8
9

As, Damon, you're probably aware, but
maybe others around the table are not; the

10

private activity bonds or PABs are currently

11

being debated as part of the tax reform bill.

12

And a stop of what House passed, they have

13

removed the PABs program.

14
15
16
17
18
19
20

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So there is --

It's in the Senate --

there was -MR. BUDESCU:

Did they put it back in the

Senate bill?
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

It was retained in the

Senate bill.
MR. BUDESCU:

Okay.

So if PABs remain an

21

instrument that is available, I think there would

22

be very good reason to look at creating a volume

23

with the Federal DOT for the project for the

24

concessionaire to access as part of their
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

22

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

financing plan.

2

Ultimately we can help facilitate

3

these processes, but we leave it up to the

4

concessionaires to determine their best plan of

5

finance and compete with one another on the

6

ultimate financing and package and bid.

7

somebody can do it for cheaper and they don't

8

want to access PABs, that's ultimately a risk in

9

the choice that the concessionaire makes.

So if

But if

10

PABs is available, I think we will do -- we will

11

work with the City and make the volume cap

12

available towards the project.

13
14
15

MR. SILVERS:
explanation.

Thank you for that

I appreciate it.

MR. SCOTT:

Tom answered a portion of my

16

question.

Is there anything similar to that -- I

17

know that I went to Taiwan and they have a high

18

speed rail that kind of shoots across Taiwan

19

including their airport.

20

public private financing similar to what -- we're

21

doing private, but it was a public private kind

22

of financing that helped them get this project

23

off the ground and then they turned it over to

24

someone else.

And it was some kind of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

23

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

So the question is, you know, will we

2

be requesting that, you know, these people who

3

are qualified to come down the line, look at

4

other places, in Europe, in Asia, to kind of do

5

things that are similar so that we're not

6

reinventing the wheel.

7

You know, they have a high speed rail

8

there that shoots up and down right through the

9

middle of their -- and I think that's pretty much

10

all their public transportation is and everything

11

else is done by cab or some other kind of cab

12

type service.

13

So are we going to be requesting that

14

kind of stuff and are we looking at other places

15

to kind of guide what it is that we want?

16

MR. BUDESCU:

Yeah, so the working group has

17

taken a look at a number of precedents around the

18

world.

19

Asian precedence, there is the Heathrow Express

20

and the Toronto -- the name of the service

21

escapes me at the moment.

22

you know, mixed degrees of success with them and

23

we're trying to take the best practices; but I

24

think we're also hoping that there has been

So as you may have mentioned there is the

And there has been,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

24

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

technological advances that can also help

2

facilitate the delivery and financing of this

3

project that weren't necessarily available in the

4

past.

5

And so we've issued this RFQ and we've

6

had interest from -- you know, we've had RSVP's

7

from all these global concessionaires that are

8

operating all of these assets.

9

we get the statements of qualifications, we're

So I think when

10

going to expect to see people that have worked on

11

these projects all around the world and expect

12

them to come help and apply those lessons learned

13

to our project through a collaborative RFP

14

process.

15

MR. SCOTT:

Is there anything similar in the

16

United States?

17

rail, but is there anything similar in our

18

country to what we're attempting to do?

19

I know there is not high speed

MR. BUDESCU:

There is the Denver Eagle

20

Project that connected to their airport which is

21

not an express service, but I think it's the --

22

there is nothing that seems to do exactly what

23

we're doing currently in the United States.

24

MR. RAMIREZ:

But that airport too is very

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

25

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

far.

2

MR. BUDESCU:

3

MR. SCOTT:

Very far.

And are we -- I know we're not

4

at that level of detail; but frequency, you know,

5

I think frequency will be really important if

6

it's taking 20 minutes from here to there.

7

is the frequency of folks getting on -- so it's

8

not more like a martyr -- I'm sorry, not a

9

martyr, like a Metra.

10

MR. BUDESCU:

What

The RFQ specifies that we are

11

looking to achieve a frequency of at least 15 --

12

every 15 minutes and I think I want to say 18

13

hours of service.

14

MS. DARLING:

15

MR. SCOTT:

16

MR. BUDESCU:

20 hours of service.

17

MS. DARLING:

20 hours of service a day.

18

MR. BUDESCU:

Those are project goals.

20.

Okay.

19

Right.

20

not, but that's sort of where we're setting the

21

bar in the expectations of what we would like to

22

achieve.

23
24

Ultimately we'll see what's feasible or

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Let me explain one

comment on Kym's question.

I've been working on

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

26

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

this for 14 years.

2

Nobody else has done it in a way that says, hey,

3

can you finance it this way?

4

ones in other countries are heavily subsidized

5

and don't, you know, don't take their operative

6

expenses, you know.

7

The technology is different.

All of those other

I'm probably skeptical that we'll get

8

that close.

I think Damon's point will be

9

necessary to close the gap in financing, but I

10

think it's really important as we go through this

11

process to actually set up the technology and the

12

ideas and to really have the private sector

13

compete for the best ideas.

14

here.

What can be done

What has changed.

15

You know, we've got the alignment and

16

the growth in the downtown area that would

17

support the economics of this long-term, but

18

that's one of the nice things about the way we've

19

done things in the City for a long time is we had

20

General Electric and Westinghouse competing in

21

The World's Fair to see who could run better

22

electric.

23
24

So I envision this a little bit
similar to them.

Let's try to get as many good

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

27

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

ideas as we can.

2

and the City around routing and opportunities to

3

sort of help provide the best government support

4

and public support for it, but at the end of the

5

day it's got to stand on its own from an

6

execution standpoint.

7

We'll work with, you know, Tom

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So the next step is the

8

December 20th resubmittal conference and the

9

statement of qualifications are due January 24th.

10

MS. DARLING:

Uh-huh.

11

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

12

MS. DARLING:

All right.

So to update you on the Joint

13

Public Safety Training Academy Project, we did

14

discuss this at our last meeting in pretty great

15

detail that was concurrent with the release of

16

the RFQ for that project.

17

As a reminder it's a new 30-acre

18

campus in the West Garfield Park Community to

19

provide state-of-the-art classroom scenario

20

training for both Chicago Police and Chicago Fire

21

Fighters.

22

We issued the procurement in

23

coordination with our main client, the Department

24

of Fleet and Facility Management and CPD and CFD
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

28

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

to select a developer to design, build and

2

finance this project.

3

The estimated timeline for the project

4

is 18 to 24 months.

5

goals for the project of 28 percent MBE, 8

6

percent WBE.

7

required to be City of Chicago residents; and of

8

those 15 percent need to be from the local

9

community surrounding West Garfield Park.

10

As you know we have MBE, WBE

50 percent of the work hours are

We spoke on this pretty extensively

11

last time, but I wanted to make sure that you are

12

all updated.

13

we issued the RFQ October 11th concurrent with

14

our last board meeting.

15

attendees at our presubmittal conference that

16

took place at the end of October.

17

So with our timeline here as I said

We had over 150

City Council approved the land

18

acquisition at the November City Council meeting

19

and our SOQ's were due on November 20th.

We

20

received 6 SOQ's from 6 different teams.

And we

21

expect that we'll short list this month and then

22

issue in 2018 -- early 2018 an RFP with the

23

expectation to select a successful proposer

24

shortly thereafter.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

29

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

So I wanted to make sure that you were

2

aware of the RFQ respondents.

3

This is also available on our website and I have

4

sent it to you previously.

5

at the level of teams that have interest in this

6

project.

7

evaluation process right now, and I will have

8

more to update you on at our next meeting.

9

Hopefully we'll be able to short list from this

We are very pleased

And we are in the middle of the

10

team very soon.

11

questions about this project?

12

This is the list.

That is our expectation.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Any

Just a comment really.

13

And, you know, I've raised this at the last one

14

just in terms of the training that we are

15

requesting the design for and kind of being very

16

explicit about that and the process.

17

You know, we're a -- this is a

18

priority for the City and we are a vehicle that

19

is being used to execute it efficiently.

20

have no, you know, sort of say on it is a

21

priority from what the training is or any of --

22

our role here is to make sure that the process

23

gets the City of Chicago and its first responders

24

and public safety officers, you know, what they

So we

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

30

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1
2

need and what they're looking for here.
But I think that in doing so part of

3

what I think we can be clear about in the next

4

phase of this where we sort of short list to the

5

RFP is -- and I suspect this is happening.

6

just want to be just sort of clear with the

7

fellow board members and with the staff that I

8

think part of us doing our jobs here is being

9

focussed on the quality and the sort of explicit

I

10

innovative nature of this training and the design

11

-- the innovative nature and the design that is

12

suited to that training.

13

narrative has been lost, you know, in the public

14

conversation a little bit.

15

trust that it won't be in the actual activity

16

that we're sort of endeavoring here, you know.

17

So much of this can sort of be like

And I think that that

But I know that and I

18

another real estate project that is design, build

19

and finance; but I think we have an opportunity

20

here in the short listing of really pushing on

21

the innovative design piece of it to address what

22

are, you know, clear training needs and sort of a

23

new way to think about training for these two

24

departments.

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

MR. MARQUISOS:

If I can just comment on

2

that really briefly.

3

for this project was done by 2FM before CIT

4

became involved.

5

meetings with police and fire and other

6

municipalities and they really did I think some

7

really strong groundwork on this.

8

So most of the preplanning

And so they had extensive

And since we became involved we have

9

been kind of playing catch up and having both

10

attorneys and city folks and also with other,

11

quote, unquote, state-of-the-art users across the

12

country.

13

am just completely unaware of the vast multitude

14

of situations that are our public safety people

15

have to respond to.

16
17
18

And personally I am just totally -- I

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And they're not prepared

for.
MR. MARQUISOS:

And, I mean, whether they're

19

prepared or not, I can't comment on; but it just

20

seems to me there are so many different

21

situations within a large metropolitan area like

22

us that we have that it's impossible to think --

23

I mean, unless you think about it, you really go,

24

oh, yes, we do have the all these subways.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

Oh,

32

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

yes, we do have all these high rises.

2

we do have all these concealed spaces.

Oh, yes,

3

we do have all this domestic violence.

And there

4

are all these different so that the buzz word in

5

this arena as I come to understand it is

6

scenario-based training.

7

create these scenarios where people can actually

8

get comfortable with all of these situations.

9

Oh, yes,

And so how do you

And there is a lot of innovation in

10

this field, and I'm personally really excited

11

about what this is likely to pretend for us.

12

Because I think we're pretty standard in straight

13

forward classroom right now and I think we have

14

the ability to really up the ante here.

15

MR. BUDESCU:

And I think to just layer on

16

that and to your point, Treasurer, is that the

17

way the procurement is structured is that we're

18

going to be asking the RFP for conceptual

19

designs; but what we're not expected and what we

20

don't want to do is have these developers, these

21

designers and contractors just come up with their

22

own design and the City pick out of them.

23
24

We're going to pick a team that puts
together a conceptual design, a thoughtful
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

33

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

process, a good financing plan and brings strong

2

qualifications.

3

we're going to work with them collaboratively

4

with 2FM, with fire, with police to work together

5

to insure that the design of this -- of this

6

facility is in line with the needs of fire and

7

police to their curriculum and their training

8

requirements and to design a building and a

9

facility that most efficiently and effectively is

10

And then once we pick them,

able to achieve those within our budget.

11

So it's all going to be done in a

12

collaborative process where the stakeholders

13

participate in the -- in the development of the

14

facility.

15

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Is one of the

16

stakeholders here or the, you know, 2.7 million

17

people that live here; how do we engage community

18

stakeholders in this process?

19

through the formal mechanisms that both of the

20

two departments have; but, I mean, you know, I

21

would be interested in the public saying here is

22

what I would like to make sure takes place in

23

this new facility that is being invested in.

24

MR. MARQUISOS:

And it may be

That's a great question.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

34

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

MS. DARLING:

We have become -- begun some

2

community engagement that I expect that will be

3

greater as the project moves forward.

4

you know, we have the opportunity here at our

5

board meetings.

6

process as well, and we'll continue to work with

7

both police and fire who do a tremendous amount

8

of community engagement as well as I'm sure they

9

will on this project.

10

And we'll,

The City Council also has their

But we'll -- we will circle back with

11

them and express the commitment to that and

12

continue to work with them, and I will keep this

13

Board updated on how that proceeds.

14
15
16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Well, I think we have an

opportunity to be thoughtful in that.
MR. SCOTT:

I also think that, you know,

17

engaging with COPA and the board in which they're

18

creating, making sure that the ideas and

19

processes and thoughtfulness that comes through

20

their process is also -- I think lends itself to

21

this process.

22

You know, we want to make sure the one

23

thing that I have heard through this discussion

24

is one of the officers that came and testified
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

35

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

before the Housing Committee talked about how the

2

building in which he trained in 27 years ago is

3

the same building in which they're training in

4

now.

5

And so when we're talking about all of

6

these new things that have happened across the

7

country and that could possibly happen here in

8

Chicago, it's very important that we have our

9

officers and our fire fighters, our first

10

responders, all training together.

11

of these things that are happening across the

12

world and in our country and in New York, are

13

things that could very well happen here and they

14

all need to have a coordinated effort.

15

Because some

But to the Chair's point, making sure

16

that, you know, when we're building this we're

17

also keeping in mind that we've had issues in

18

Chicago that community members have a stake in

19

and they want to be heard in making sure that

20

when we're doing this -- and I know a lot of the

21

planning that 2FM has done with this has been

22

centered around things that the DOJ has issued

23

that we do.

24

And so making sure that, again, we're
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

36

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

keeping all persons that have a stake in this

2

game and, again, those 2.7 million that the

3

Chairman mentioned I think have a big stake in

4

this game in making sure that the officers are

5

trained -- the officers and first responders are

6

trained in a manner in which is going to help our

7

community as a whole and help our city as a whole

8

move forward and move past some of the issues

9

that we've had over the past four or five years.

10

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Is there a fire

11

equivalent to COPA?

12

getting at was maybe the existing infrastructure

13

can be used to engaged -- I just don't know the

14

answer.

15

MR. SCOTT:

I mean, that's what I was

I don't think that they've had

16

the issues in which CPD has had over the course

17

19

the fire department comes out, they're usually

20

helping somebody in -- and there is no dispute

21

when there is a fire, you know, the people inside

22

they need to come out, they need to be helped.

23

So I don't think that that has happened.

They're actually one of our more

However, I think that there still

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

needs to be some kind of community engagement

2

around what needs to happen, what needs to be

seen and what folks want to happen in this

academy.

5

Chairman.

6

I think that you are correct in that,

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Okay.

Well, it sounds

7

like, you know, there's been obviously

8

thoughtfulness on this with respect to 2FM and

9

we're sort of beginning to incorporate it.

10

I would, you know, push the team to

11

think about how if not to incorporate it in the

12

RFP responses, just to sort of provide clarity

13

through this process that there will be this

14

engagement.

15

have to be a part of, you know, a community

16

engagement process.

So the successful respondent will

17

MS. DARLING:

Yes.

18

MS. HUBBARD:

I would just have one comment

19

and then I have a question.

Given the amount of

20

time that we have before this project is

21

complete, you know, I know there's already been

22

some engagement, but there should be consistent

23

engagement so that at the last minute six months

24

or three months before the project is done;
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

38

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

you're trying to ram something down folks' throat

2

and then they're like, oh, we didn't have time to

3

prepare for it.

4

So given the amount of time that we

5

have I would just also encourage the team to use

6

all that time to the benefit of the community

7

rather than intending whether they can.

8
9

I was just going to say and then my question
is the sleeves that you have here, does that

10

imply that, for example, Chicago Public Safety

11

Partners they're gathering together to do this

12

whereas Jones Lang is going to bid independently

13

or something?

Is that what that means?

14

MS. DARLING:

Yes, these are --

15

MR. BUDESCU:

These are, yeah, the teams in

16

the form consortiums are bidding independently.

17

MS. HUBBARD:

Okay.

18

MR. BUDESCU:

So each column is its own

19

team.

20

MS. HUBBARD:

Its own team.

Thanks.

21

MS. DARLING:

So I really appreciate the

22

Board's comment and we'll make sure to

23

incorporate those comments and bring them back to

24

our partners at 2FM and police and fire to make

sure we can incorporate these ideas going

forward.

training?

Any other comments on public safety

4

MS. BARRETT:

Can you reiterate the timing?

5

MS. DARLING:

The goal is to short list this

6

month and then finish developing and release our

7

RFP in the -- as soon as possible in the new

8

year.

9

through the procurement.

And then after that we will proceed
I don't have a firm

10

date for the next step after the release of the

11

RFP.

12

MS. BARRETT:

And the follow up, how are you

13

feeling about CIT's capacity to see these two

14

major efforts forward on an intersecting

15

timetable?

16

MS. DARLING:

Well, I won't -- you know, as

17

I mentioned in my introduction, you know, we

18

continue to partner with the City on projects

19

that are very high priority.

20

as I mentioned, we may need to right size by

21

adding one additional person that I mentioned at

22

the beginning of the meeting.

23
24

And as of right now

And everybody is working at capacity
and working very, very hard on our team and which
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

I appreciate and I know the City appreciates.

2

And we want to focus on, you know, delivering

3

very high value service.

4

extraordinarily busy, but right now I have no

5

doubt that we will be able to meet and exceed the

6

responsibilities given to us.

7

MR. MARQUISOS:

We have been

And if I can just add to be

8

clear, these are not CIT projects in a sense.

9

These are City of Chicago projects.

And so,

10

yeah, we're really program managers and we're

11

harnessing the resources that are available to

12

us.

13

hands.

14

capacity.

15

And so not everything is being done by our
So that's the -- that's what gives us the

MS. DARLING:

Yes, right.

We have -- we

16

have excellent partners at the City, you know,

17

who are also putting in tremendous -- a

18

tremendous number of hours on all these projects

19

as the CIT team does.

20

and the team at 2FM, there is a lot of people who

21

are participating in all of these projects from

22

numerous different departments and numerous

23

stakeholders who are -- who are really putting in

24

a ton of time to this.

But, you know, between law

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:
questions?

Okay.

All right.

Any other

MS. DARLING:

Move on to the next update.
Okay.

Now I would like to

4

talk about the 1685 North Throop relocation

5

project which is a development of 3 facilities to

6

replace an existing Department of Fleet and

7

Facility Management headquarters at North and

8

Throop.

9

So as we discussed and have discussed

10

at the last board meeting, there is going to be

11

three new facilities.

12

bring you an address for the main shop which is

13

going to be in Englewood and the address is going

14

to be 210 West 69th Street.

15

new address for it.

16

and administrative headquarters for 2FM.

17

We promised you we would

And we had to get a

And that's the main workshop

They are going from 400,000 square

18

feet at North and Throop which was an old steel

19

plant that was not meant to be a maintenance

20

garage, and now they're going to move into right

21

sized -- a right-sized building that works

22

perfectly for them.

23
24

And there will be a satellite shop on
the north side because it doesn't make sense to
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

42

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

bring all of the north side vehicles down to the

2

south side for moderate maintenance.

3

satellite shop will be at 4241 North Neenah, a

4

smaller facility of only 31,000 square feet.

5

So that

And a fueling station at 1152 North

6

North Branch which will be very close to the

7

North and Throop facility where the current

8

fueling station is.

9

at 2500 square feet.

That's a very small facility

10

The goal of this project was to make

11

sure that 2FM had the capability to deliver its

12

core services both more efficiently and more

13

economically.

14

the 1685 North Throop site which they sold to

15

Sterling Bay for $106 million.

16

the works.

17

it will do so shortly.

18

The City made the decision to sell

That deal is in

It has not yet closed, but we expect

The City wishes to provide benefit to

19

under-developed communities through

20

infrastructure investment and workforce

21

development.

22

construction jobs primarily based in the

23

Englewood community, but at all 3 of these

24

locations.

And we are going to have 100 to 200

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

43

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

2FM will bring 200 skilled jobs to

2

relocate to Englewood.

3

created in the community and there will -- the

4

goal is to catalyze further economic development.

5

10
11

MS. HUBBARD:

There will be 250 jobs

That's permanent jobs?

250

permanent jobs?
MS. DARLING:

It's between 200 and 250

permanent jobs that are being relocated there.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

What's the difference

between the relocated number and the 250 number?
MR. BUDESCU:

There is the 100 to 200

12

construction jobs.

And then there's about 225

13

employees of 2FM that are now going to be

14

relocating from current offices either at 1685

15

North Throop and some probably at 30 North here

16

that will now have their offices in the --

17

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

18

MR. BUDESCU:

69th Street.

Yeah, at 69th Street including

19

Commissioner Reynolds will be out of the new

20

offices in Englewood.

21

new jobs.

22

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

23

MR. BUDESCU:

24

Those are not going to be

Right.

These are relocated jobs, but

over time I think there is an opportunity there
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

44

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

for those long term --

2

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

There was another number,

3

you said there was 250 jobs created in the

4

community.

5

inclusive of the --

So I didn't know if that was

6

MS. DARLING:

7

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

8

MS. DARLING:

9

Inclusive.
Okay.

Yes, so the construction jobs

are separate from the relocated jobs.

10

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

11

MS. DARLING:

Got it.

So the additional goal is to

12

design facilities that support the current

13

operations.

14

property that was much too big for what they were

15

doing.

16

so -- so they're going to be rightsizing their

17

facilities to support the work that they do

18

currently.

19

into the new site first snow season of 2018.

20

we are on an extraordinarily tight timeline and

21

we are moving very quickly.

As I said, they were operating in

It was very expensive to maintain.

And

And the goal is to get the operations
So

22

I do want to take the opportunity to

23

introduce Bill Abolt who is sitting in the back

24

of the room.

He is from AECOM and AECOM is our

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

45

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

selected vendor for this process.

2

wanted to take a minute just to quickly go over

3

the project timeline.

4

And so I

We issued this RFP back in May.

AECOM

5

was selected and we discussed this extensively at

6

the last board meeting.

7

-- AECOM was selected, and so far they have been

8

working collaboratively with the City and

9

primarily 2FM with some assistance from CIT to

10
11

And after a process and

collaboratively design the three projects.
And they have conducted community

12

outreach via Aldermanic meetings.

13

subcontractor outreach events and they are going

14

to be holding multiple job fairs for this project

15

to be held in January and February.

16

They held

Tom, at this point I would like to ask

17

you to fill in some additional information about

18

where we are in the design and contracting

19

process and then I'll talk about what's next.

20

MR. BUDESCU:

So as you may recall from our

21

previous meeting, we structured this procurement

22

in a bit of an unorthodox way that we asked for

23

the qualifications and proposals.

24

And once we selected the highest
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

46

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

ranked proposal, we asked -- we invited that

2

selected team, which was in this case AECOM, to

3

enter a design development phase which is still

4

considered part of our procurement.

5

signed a contract with them.

6

completely at risk to collaboratively design the

7

three facilities, refine the scope for those

8

facilities and the guaranteed maximum price.

We have not

They are working

9

And the expectation is that as if we

10

think they have done a good job and we're happy

11

with the design and the price, we will then take

12

those documents along with the contract for the

13

project to City Council for its approval for the

14

Commissioner to enter into a contract for the

15

design and construction of these facilities at

16

that guaranteed maximum price.

17

So what we've really been focussed on

18

is this design development phase.

So we have

19

been spending probably hundreds of hours with the

20

AECOM team and the 2FM team.

21

construction architecture folks at 2FM, but the

22

folks that are in charge of the fleet facilities

23

and the fleet operations to make sure that what's

24

being designed is the appropriate and also most

And so not just the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

47

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

economical way to achieve their operating goals.

2

And I'm really pleased to say I think

3

AECOM has done a tremendous job.

4

close to finalizing that scope and budget and

5

we're hoping to introduce that design and GMP's,

6

our guaranteed maximum price, and contract on

7

December 13th to City Council and enter into a

8

contract by January in order to get these

9

facilities completed as soon as possible and open

10
11

We are really

by -- by snow season.
MS. DARLING:

Are there any questions about

12

this project?

Okay.

And so at this point we

13

would like to recommend that as you saw in the

14

resolutions, that the City engage -- that the CIT

15

Board recommend to the City of Chicago for the

16

completion of the design process and negotiation

17

regarding a contract for this project.

18

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

3

MS. DARLING:

Ayes have it.

Great.

Thank you.

And we'll

4

look forward to updating you on this at the next

5

meeting as well.

6

Now, for a quick update on smart

7

lighting.

You're all very familiar with this

8

project.

9

that we are working on, and George has been

As you can see this is the current map

10

really integral to standing this project up and

11

so I wanted him to speak for a couple of minutes

12

on the project progress here.

13

MR. MARQUISOS:

Okay.

I think everyone

14

knows this project well enough by now.

15

just kind of cut to the chase as to how things

16

are going.

17

So I'll

We had -- the City had decided that

18

they were going to focus the installation of 2017

19

LED's on the main thoroughfares in two target

20

areas.

21

as outlined here.

22

of 2017 approximately 19,000 fixtures converted

23

to LED.

24

One on the south and one on the west side
That would entail by the end

As of last week we have 12,400 of
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

49

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

those fixtures installed.

2

that effort there is a citywide survey of the

3

condition of every lamppost and light in the

4

City.

5

have people canvassing the City block by block,

6

pole by pole, day in and day out.

7

In conjunction with

So there is some 330,00 of those and so we

And as of last week 164,500 of those

8

poles have been assessed as to their condition

9

and the context of which they light.

So that is

10

producing a database that is going to be very

11

useful for CDOT both in determining what it is

12

they have and what needs they have in terms of

13

repairing and maintaining the vast lighting

14

infrastructure that the City has.

15

So we are about 50 percent done with

16

the citywide assessment.

17

with the work that was envisioned for 2017.

18

are on track to finish that work as scheduled by

19

December 22nd.

20

us because by December 31st we have to submit

21

applications to ComEd for the rebates that go

22

hand in hand with those conversions.

23
24

We are 65 percent done
We

That date is kind of important to

So it's been a -- a big effort.

We

certainly had our share of learning experiences.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

50

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

There are a lot of variabilities in the streets

2

of Chicago and we're tackling those on a

3

day-to-day basis.

4

Generally speaking the public reaction

5

has been positive.

6

terms of lights turning on earlier or later than

7

the previous sensors.

8

with what daylight sensors determine dusk being.

9

We've had some glitches in

And that all has to do

So some residents were confused, well,

10

why are these high pressure lights on, these are

11

off.

12

beauty is that we have a lighting management

13

system now that affords us the ability to control

14

the lights and kind of address these concerns as

15

they arise.

16

So we've kind of worked those out.

And the

So of those 12,400 LED's, we currently

17

have 8,250 of them reporting on a network that

18

are within our control.

19

make sure that they are working and we can adjust

20

the time that they go on and off accordingly.

21

that all in all I think the project is working

22

very much as we anticipated it would.

23

think it's a very positive start.

24

So we can monitor to

So

And I

2018 work will, again, focus on these
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

51

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

two areas.

2

will.

3

alleys and the viaducts within there will now get

4

converted as well.

5

see these two areas be fully LED.

6

that the mesh of their control network fully

7

built out.

8

2018.

9

We'll be filling out the areas if you

So all the residential streets and the

So by the mid 2018 you will
And along with

So that's the goal for first part of

In addition to that there will be

10

lights installed across the City just to -- so

11

every ward will be touched in 2018.

12

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

13

MR. SCOTT:

Alderman Scott.

So I've seen the work that

14

they've done and they are doing a terrific job.

15

I mean, they're so fast and efficient.

16

I went to -- I drove down 16th Street when I left

17

to go to my office and when I came back home

18

going back on 16th Street, they had done the

19

entire block which I think is really cool and

20

speaks to how efficient in the work that they're

21

doing.

22

Couple questions.

You know,

One, you mentioned

23

the sensors being different between dusk.

24

know, I see -- I've seen that happen.

You

And so how

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

52

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

do we communicate -- we communicate that through

2

CDOT or --

3

MR. MARQUISOS:

4

MR. SCOTT:

Yeah.

Okay.

CDOT.

All right.

Got

5

that.

And then I know that they're -- they've

6

done all of the Cobra heads, the top lighting.

7

Is there an issue with the street pole lighting

8

is the one that comes out of the top?

9

I've seen them do all of those and then in some

Because

10

areas they've completed both the Cobra head

11

lights and then the lights at the bottom.

12

is the -- why haven't they completed the

13

entire --

14
15

MR. MARQUISOS:

What

The hold up on the coach

lights --

16

MR. SCOTT:

Yes, coach lights.

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

Is they have what's called

18

an internal control node and that's being

19

manufactured overseas and there have been some

20

delays in receiving that node.

21

The beauty of that whole process is

22

that those coach lights the City spent a lot of

23

money on them and they're actually quite

24

valuable.

So the process is to not change them,
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

53

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - December 5, 2017

1

but to retrofit them.

2

they get brought to a facility where Chicago

3

residents convert them to LED, install an

4

internal node and then get reinstalled.

5

So they get taken down,

So there is a -- the good news is

6

there's not nearly as many of them as Cobra

7

heads.

8

had some delay associated with the delivery of

9

internal nodes.

The bad news is they take longer and we

Those nodes have been delivered

10

now so we are on track -- they're working extra

11

hours, seven days a week to get that done in time

12

by the end of the year.

13

MR. SCOTT:

So, yeah, I was going to then

14

follow up and ask will it happen before your

15

timeline to get the rebate in.

16

that it will.

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

18

MR. SCOTT:

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

So you're saying

I'm being told yes.

Okay.
But we -- we're on them very

20

-- I mean, this is a topic of conversation on a

21

day-to-day basis.

22

and what happened?

23

high point.

24

and I think we're going to get there weather

Like, where are the nodes now
So there is a whole -- it's a

It's clearly on the critical path

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

permitting.

2

MS. DARLING:

So far so good.

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Any other questions on

4

the lighting besides when are they going to make

5

it to the 19th Ward?

6

to the next part.

7

MS. DARLING:

All right.

Great.

Let's move on

So just to touch base

8

quickly on Homebuyers Assistance.

9

approved lenders.

We have 19

We have closed loans in 46 out

10

of the 50 City Wards.

11

with a value of 39 -- just over $39 million.

12

Almost 5 million in open loans and 112 qualified

13

borrowers for a total of over $66 million.

14

any questions about this?

15
16

We have 190 closed loans

And

Great.

At this point we had one person who

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Audrey Fischer.

MS. FISCHER:

What I'm about to say I

Hi.

19

forwarded to you just about 20 minutes ago to you

20

in e-mail, and I hope that you will share it with

21

everybody on the CIT Board.

22

And I heard on a radio show that the

23

CIT Chicago and Ameresco are being sued because

24

of alleged rigged dealings in the choice of the

streetlight fixtures.

2

I strongly believe there ought to be a

3

moratorium on the ongoing installations of these

4

bright-white blue-rich LED streetlights not only

5

because of the alleged rigged deals.

6

First, do no harm.

The rule -- this

7

is the rule we should do with decision making.

8

Put a moratorium on LED streetlights being

9

installed currently in Chicago and install 2200K

10

or 1800K instead.

The blue wavelength, 450

11

nanometers, in the bright-white streetlights is

12

the most disruptive, harmful to human health and

13

safety, ecosystems and environment.

14

I can show you 1,000 supportive

15

documents and citations that support this.

16

provide significant credible documentation why

17

Chicago Residents will be less safe because of

18

the light pollution directly caused by inferior

19

lighting of these bright-white blue-rich LED

20

streetlights.

21

good LED's too.

22

And it's not just LED.

I can

There's

We're just not picking them.

Ecosystems and environment are also

23

harmed.

Specifically the blue 450 nanometer blue

24

wavelength needs to be eliminated or minimized to

the greatest extent possible in permanent outdoor

lighting.

3

Chicago can do better than that.
I've seen these new harmful LED

streetlights installed throughout Chicago

including occasional ones in the 21st Ward.

easy to fix.

14

streetlights that minimize light pollution

15

especially by eliminating or minimizing blue-rich

bright-white light at night especially the 450

17

bandwidth and aim lights down on target where

18

it's needed ending light trespass into private

19

property especially bedroom windows where it

20

shuts down the ability for chemotherapy to work

about.

2

George, you repeatedly stated that you

3

were anticipating that the LED's, the technology

4

would improve and that our contracts are written

5

so that we have access to that and those are the

6

fixtures that we can install.

7

hope.

9

This gives me

I came across a company in -- in the
spring of 2017 I came across a Canadian

10

manufacture who was about to release a new

11

streetlight luminaire saying that they could

12

reduce this blue problem.

13

me the specs and I'll have lighting experts that

14

I know around the world look at it.

15

I asked them to send

Our lighting experts put a thumbs down

16

on it.

17

something astounding.

18

with our project -- product and why -- what is

19

the issue and how -- what would you like to see?

20

And this lighting manufacture did
They said what is wrong

From May until November they totally

21

redesigned this luminaire.

23

in quality and it beats your price range.

Thank you for your time.

Thank you, Miss Fischer.
There are no other

entertain a motion to adjourn.
