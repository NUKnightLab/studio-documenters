Funding from this amendment will go towards the creation of an Electrician Apprenticeship Program for Cook County in the
Department of Facilities Management. An apprentice is a paid worker who is enrolled in a special training program administered
by an employer together with a labor organization or trade association. In partnership with our local electrician unions, it is the
goal of Cook County to provide the highest quality training to those interested in a career in the various ?elds within the electrical
industry. Apprentices graduated from the apprenticeship program are moved up to full trade status. This amendment will
provide funding for two apprentices.
