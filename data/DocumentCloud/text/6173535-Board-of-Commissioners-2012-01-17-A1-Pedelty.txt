EXPLANATION

In 2007, the CHA Board of Commissioners and the Executive Staff embarked upon a strategic
planning effort to ensure that the agency moved forward in the proper direction concurrent to the
requirements of the CHA Plan for Transformation. The goals and objectives of the agency are
now focused on maintaining a new portfolio of assets and ensuring that creative methods are
used to complete the rehabilitation and redevelopment efforts within the constraints of our
current economic climate. In addition, several critical objectives were developed during that
period, including: Increasing Occupancy, Establishing an effective Asset Management
Structure, Aligning the Agency with the Strategic Plan and New Asset Management Model, and
Improving Management Capacity.

Throughout the course of 2008 and 2009, the prior strategic planning engagement successfully
assisted the CHA in 1) aligning the agency in a manner that critically matches the Strategic Plan;
2) addressing organizational design issues, matching the proper staff with the appropriate
functions within the agency?s new organizational structure; 3) ensuring that the new aligmnent
has created provisions for accountability for all Strategic Plan Participants; 4) ensuring that there
is a deliberate reporting mechanism to the Board of Commissioners and all staff so that all
parties understand where the agency is in the process of the Strategic Plan as it relates to the Plan
for Transformation. These efforts have been accomplished through the facilitation of quarterly
retreats with t0p management.

In 2010 -2011, Pedelty Enterprises was successful in assisting the CHA with numerous strategic
planning efforts in support of the objectives noted above. Speci?cally, the engagement was
critical in assisting the CHA in the creation of a detailed transition plan that ended the court
receivership under the provisions of the Gautreaux vs. CHA order. In addition, the contract also
focused on tactical and strategic planning intervention to support the executive team and their
divisions in compliance with federal, city and other mandates and initiatives. Finally, in order to
assist in the effective communication of the implementation of the Strategic Plan, this
engagement also successfully included the facilitation of Leadership and Board of Commissioner
bi- annual retreats.

As the CHA plans to recalibrate and revise the Plan for Transformation under the guidance of the
newly appointed Chief Executive Of?cer, this extension option will focus on ensuring that the
current management team is organized to ?t the new vision of the agency. This will include an
emphasis on Executive Coaching for the Executive team members reporting to the Chief
Executive Of?cer/ President in an effort to further the success of the agency?s strategic
alignment, and to enhance sound customer service relationships between all levels of partners
and agency stakeholders.

Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA that the Board of Commissioners
authorize the Chief Executive Of?cer or his authorized designee(s) to exercise option year one
for Contract No. 10l3 (?Contract?) with Pedelty Enterprises, LLC for Consulting Services
related to strategic planning efforts for the period March 1, 2012 through February 28,
2013 in amount not-to-exceed $240,000.00.
