Summary: Contract 17-31-117 consists of a variety of Conservation Corps internship programs focused
on ecological restoration throughout the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Preserves”). The
Conservation Corps co-facilitates innovative job training and employment programs that provide
participants with paid, hands-on experiences in conservation that train the next generation to restore and
be responsible stewards of the land. The Preserves issued a Request for Proposals, and received a total of
nine (9) proposals from three (3) vendors for this project.

The Preserves assembled a review panel consisting of various Preserve staff that considered Friends of
the Forest Preserves’ proposal one of the most responsive including particular strengths in experience,
match contribution, program scalability, and performance capacity as it relates to the work requested in
the proposal. The Chicago Conservation Leadership Corp internship program will engage approximately
eighty-eight (88) high school students, seventeen (17) adult leaders, and eight (8) assistant field leaders
annually in hands-on ecological restoration activities including invasive species control. The program is an
intensive six week paid summer internship that will promote stewardship of natural lands by the next
generation of conservation leaders through ecologically based educational activities, conservation
awareness, hands-on restoration and enjoyment of the forest preserves.
The Preserves believe it is critical to engage individuals from Cook County’s diverse communities in
conservation jobs at the Preserves. Conservation Corps programs have been very successful in engaging
participants from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, ages and ethnicities. Corps demographic
data from 2007 to 2016 show that on average 54% of participants were African American, 23%
Caucasian, 18% Latino, 3% biracial, and 2% Asian.
Total project costs are $699,632.00 annually, with $200,000.00 in investment by the Preserves leveraging
$499,632.00 in partner match. The overall annual contract authority was increased in anticipation of
additional funding opportunities. This program advances the goals of the Next Century Conservation Plan.

Agreement Number(s): N/A
District: 9
Summary: The Preserves has been awarded a grant from the CCDOTH through the Invest in Cook

program in the amount of $100,000.00 for engineering services to identify how to best close the
100-foot gap in the Des Plaines Trail System. CCDOTH’s Invest in Cook program helps cover the
cost of planning and feasibility studies, engineering right-of-way acquisition, and construction associated
with transportation improvements sponsored by local and regional governments and private partners.
The total estimated cost of Phase 1 engineering is $150,000. The Preserves will commit an amount not
to exceed $50,000 in matching funds for engineering services for the project. The project is important
for Cook County residents and visitors for both transit and recreation. The Trail follows its historic
namesake river through multiple forest preserves. Thousands of visitors use the 27-mile trail each year
to commute, hike, bike, bird watch, and take advantage of the benefits of spending time in nature.
