The CHA must annually renew its insurance coverage for General Liability, Excess Liability,

requests for insurance premium quotes from 31 carriers and received multiple quotes on all lines

3

 of coverage. After reviewing the responses, Aon and CHA’s Risk Management Department
recommend the following insurers listed in the below resolution to provide the required
insurance coverage for CHA for the period October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009. This
year’s renewal resulted in an overall cost savings of $50,950 or 3%.

WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated September
10, 2008 entitled "AUTHORIZATION FOR THE CHA TO AWARD GENERAL

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

(Item A2)
The resolution for Item A2 approves a new Collective Bargaining Agreement with the Service
Employees International Union, Local 73 of Chicago. The CHA employs 52 members of Local

Representatives of Local 73 and CHA
tentatively agreed to the following substantive changes: contract term of 3 years; grievance
process extended from five to seven working days; increase in uniform allowance and a
successfully completed correction action plan will not be reflected on the annual employee’s
evaluation. In addition, a Letter of Understanding was tentatively agreed upon that includes
consideration of a Sick Day Bank; review of job titles and review of Tuition Reimbursement
policy.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-109
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated September 10, 2008
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINIG
AGREEMENT WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL
UNION, LOCAL 73 ”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to execute a
new collective bargaining agreement with the Service Employees International
Union, Local 73, for the period of January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010.

(Item A3)
The resolution for Item A3 approves a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the
International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 399. The CHA employs three operating
engineers, who are members of Local 399. Under the new CBA, Operating Engineers will be
paid $32.15 per hour which represents a $0.95 per hour increase over their current hourly wage.
Additionally, the CHA will contribute $2.80 per hour to Local 399’s employee pension fund,
which represents a $0.40 increase over the last contract. The CHA will also contribute $172.00
per week for the Health and Welfare fund, which represents a $0.10 per hour increase from the

4

 last contract. The total increased cost to the CHA is $1.45 per hour for the first year of the
contract, which represents a total 3.8% cost increase of the last contract. This cost increase places
the CHA’s Operating Engineers on par with the prevailing wages that are paid in the Chicago
area (BOMA). The second year of the contract calls for a $1.55 total increase (3.8% cost
increase) and the third is for a $1.65 total increase (4.0% cost increase), with the increases
allocated between wages and benefits as determined by Local 399. A Letter of Understanding
has been agreed upon by both parties that Local 399 employees will attend at least two training
seminars a year that the CHA will deem to be important in order for the engineers to perform
their respective duties.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-110
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated September 10, 2008
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A NEW COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF
OPERATING ENGINEERS OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS AND VICINITY
(“LOCAL 399”)”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to execute the
new collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating
Engineers of Chicago, Illinois and Vicinity (“Local 399”) for the period of June 1,
2008 through May 31, 2011.

There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted.
Commissioner Ivers then advised the Chair that at the September 10th Finance Committee
Meeting, Item A4 was deferred pending further discussion and language clarification. Scott
Ammarell, General Counsel, then read the amended language, as noted below in bold italics, for
resolution A4.
Commissioner Ivers then introduced a Motion for the adoption of the Amended Resolution for
Item A4.
(Item A4)
The resolution for Item A4 approves notification to HUD of CHA’s intention not to renew the
Housing Assistance Payment Contract for LeClaire Courts for the 2009-10 Fiscal Year.
LeClaire Courts is a project-based Section 8 property adjacent to LeClaire Courts Extensions
(100% public housing). Under the Project-Based Assistance Housing Choice Voucher Program,
HUD makes rental assistance payments for qualified families who live in specific housing
developments. HUD subsidy for Project-Based Section 8 properties is made through a HAP
contract. In 1999, HUD approved CHA’s request to separate its Project-Based Section 8 sites
from the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC). This action enabled CHA to facilitate
development opportunities and the sale of the Project-Based Section 8 properties. LeClaire
Courts is the last Project-Based Section 8 property owned by the CHA. There are a total of 314
units at LeClaire Courts, but only 148 are occupied. Deteriorating conditions and insufficient
funding has left many units at LeClaire Courts in disrepair. The subsidy granted under the HAP
Contract and the rents collected are not sufficient to maintain/rehabilitate LeClaire Courts.

5

 Because LeClaire Courts residents are not eligible to be transferred into traditional public
housing at this time, in accordance with HUD regulations, residents must be given a one-year
notice of any intent to relocate them. Therefore, to discontinue the HAP contract for LeClaire
Courts for the fiscal year 2009-2010, LeClaire Courts residents must be notified in 2008 of any
intent to close the property. Eligible residents may receive a Section 8 Housing Choice voucher
to be used in the private market.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-111
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 10,
2008, entitled, “Authorization to Notify the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (“HUD”) of Intention Not to Renew the Housing Assistance
Payment (“HAP”) Contract for LeClaire Courts for the Fiscal Year 2009-2010”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to notify HUD that the CHA will not renew the HAP Contract for
LeClaire Courts for fiscal year 2009-2010 and to notify the affected residents of
CHA’ intent to close the property. This resolution is expressly conditioned upon
the CHA and the Board giving fair consideration to the following three options,
to the extent that they are available and feasible for the affected residents of
LeClaire Courts and LeClaire Courts Extension:
a)

Section 8 tenant-based vouchers;

b)

The ability to transfer to available rehabilitated public housing
units; and

c)

The ability to transfer to habitable units at LeClaire Courts
Extension, with the understanding that the determination of
habitability will be fully considered by the Board at its earliest
practical opportunity.

Commissioner Ponce, Chairperson of the Operations Committee, then presented his monthly
report. Per Commissioner Ponce, the Operations Committee meeting was held on Wednesday,
September 10, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. at the 60 East Van Buren Corporate Offices.
Commissioner Ponce then presented an Omnibus Motion for the approval of Resolutions for
Items B1 thru B4, discussed, voted and recommended for approval by the Operations and
Facilities Committee.
(Item B1)
The resolution for Item B1 approves submittal of a Mixed-finance Proposal, Evidentitaries and
Amended Disposition Application to HUD for the Horner IIC Rental redevelopment project.
The Horner IIC Rental project will consist of approximately 92 new construction mixed income
rental units, a management office and up to 3,000 square feet of commercial space. The
development will be built on CHA-owned land that formerly comprised part of the Henry Horner

6

 Homes and on a small parcel of adjacent land that the CHA is acquiring from the City of
Chicago. The development will be located in an area bounded by Wolcott Avenue on the east,
Damen Avenue on the west, Lake Street on the north and Washington Boulevard on the south.
The project is expected to provide 46 rental units of replacement public housing, subsidized by
the CHA under a 40-year contract to provide operating subsidy. Of the approximately 92 rental
units, it is expected that 78 (including the 46 public housing units) will be subject to low-income
housing tax credit restrictions and 14 units will be market rate with no restrictions. The land in
the Horner IIC Rental site will be ground leased by CHA through one or more ground leases to
the ownership entities of the Brinshore-Michaels development team. The direct costs for the
construction of the 92 units of the Horner IIC rental development total an estimated $30,799,476
and are expected to be funded by a variety of funding sources to include $6,816,746 in CHA
funds; 2) $21,702,630 Tax Credit Equity; 3)$1,650,000 First Mortgage with JP Morgan Chase;
and 4) $630,000 Deferred Developer Fee. During the construction period, JP Morgan Chase is
expected to provide an equity bridge loan in the approximate amount of $15,531,678 and will
carry an interest rate tied to LIBOR plus 200 basis points, secured by a first lien mortgage. The
bridge loan will be repaid from tax credit equity down to the permanent loan amount. The first
lender may also require a rate lock loan, to be secured by a mortgage lien on the property, which
will be paid at conversion.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-112
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated Sept 10, 2008,
requesting authorization to 1) Submit a Mixed-Finance Proposal, Evidentiaries,
and amended Disposition Application to HUD, 2) Commit CHA funds of up to
$9,000,000 to the Horner IIC Rental redevelopment project, 3) Dispose of land at
the Horner IIC Rental site to the ownership entity(ies) by one or more ground

actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to:
1) Submit a Mixed-Finance Proposal, Evidentiaries, and amended Disposition
Application to HUD, 2) Commit CHA funds of up to $9,000,000 to the Horner

(Item B2)
The resolution for Item B2 approves contract with Linn-Mathes Inc., for environmental
remediation at the Horner IIC Rental redevelopment project. The CHA Board of Commissioners
approved entering into a Master Development Agreement with BMH-I, LLC, and with Brinshore
Development, LLC and Michaels Development Company, as sponsors in June, 2002. Pursuant
to the Redevelopment Agreement, CHA is required to fund the cost of remediation for preexisting conditions on the former Henry Horner development site on a phase-by-phase basis,
subject to certain rights to terminate for infeasibility. The estimated on-site remediation costs for
the Henry Horner Homes Phase IIC rental redevelopment is $748,782. CHA’s contractual
responsibility for remediation, foreseen and unforeseen environmental conditions is capped at
225% of this estimated total cost, which is $1,684,760. All of the necessary environmental
reports and studies have been completed.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-113
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 10,
2008, requesting authorization to 1) enter into a contract with Linn-Mathes Inc.
for environmental remediation at the Henry Horner Homes redevelopment site
Phase IIC rental, and 2) execute other documents as necessary to implement the
foregoing.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

7

 THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to 1) enter into a contract with Linn-Mathes Inc. for on-site
environmental remediation activities at the Henry Horner Homes Phase IIC rental
development for a total contract amount not to exceed $1,684,760 (225% of the
estimated remediation costs), subject to any necessary HUD approvals. The term
of the contract shall be the earlier of: (i) the receipt of a “No Further
Remediation” letter from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency IEPA
with regard to the on-site Henry Horner Homes Phase IIC rental development, or
(ii) two years, subject to a one year extension at the Chicago Housing Authority’s
election, and 2) execute other documents as necessary to implement the
foregoing.

(Item B3)
The contract with Corporate Express for the delivery of paper expired in May 2008 and the CHA
went out to bid for a new vendor. The CHA advertised an IFB in area newspapers, the CHA
website and also directly solicited sixty-five vendors. The solicitation was also sent out to 17
Assist Agencies. Of the two bids received and opened, the apparent lowest bidder was Bebon
Office Machines and Supplies. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A3 approves award of
contract to Bebon Office Machines and Supplies in the amount of $285,130.00 for a two year
base contract.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-114
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated September 10,
2008 entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
BEBON OFFICE MACHINES AND SUPPLIES FOR THE SUPPLY AND
DELIVERY OF OFFICE PAPER TO THE CHA”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a contract with Bebon Office
Machines and Supplies for the supply and delivery of office paper to the CHA in
an amount not-to-exceed $285,130.00, for a base term of two (2) years, with one
(1) one-year option.

(Item B4)
The resolution for Item B4 approves Contract Modification No. G-03 to Contract No. 7085 with
Michuda Construction Inc., to install infrastructure for providing electrical, cable and telephone
conduit to five buildings at Dearborn Homes currently under construction. The buildings
affected by this modification are 2920-40 S. State Street, 2930 S. Dearborn St., 2931 S. Federal
St., and 2710 S. State St. Changes in the number of total units, and cancellation of building
demolition had a major impact on the construction design work for Dearborn. Initially, the
existing CHA-owned electrical infrastructure was expected to be adequate for the remaining
buildings. However, with the decision to retain all sixteen buildings in the development, the
Prime Design Consultant’s load tests conducted at the site indicated that the existing electrical
infrastructure would not be adequate for the increased electrical usage. With this change order,
the CHA will take responsibility for creating enclosures for the ComEd service gear, installing
CHA owned switchgear and a new duct bank, and bringing power to the buildings. To provide
the most cost effective solution for the modernization of the electrical distribution system on the
site, the CHA determined that it was best to limit ComEd’s scope to bringing service to the site.
All of these buildings are currently operating on temporary utilities throughout the construction
process. The remainder of the infrastructure work for the eleven buildings still to be renovated
will be included in future solicitation packages.

(Item C3)
In June 2008 the CHA advertised a Request for Proposal soliciting vendors to provide services to
assist CHA families during the transition of relocation, ensure CHA families are informed of all
available housing options, and connect families to their temporary and permanent housing
choices. The relocation services will target: 10/1/99 families who indicate an interest in
fulfilling their permanent housing choice in one of CHA’s family developments; families who
are required to relocate from their existing public housing units to temporary or permanent units
due to building closure or consolidation and choose to relocate using a Housing Choice Voucher;
families who need to move due to an emergency situation; and families impacted by the Senior
Designated Housing Plan who are eligible to relocate using a Housing Choice Voucher. The RFP

 was advertised in area newspapers and the CHA website. The CHA also directly solicited 97
firms, including four MBE/WBE/DBE firms and 14 assist agencies. Of the seven submittals
received three firms were found to be in the competitive range. Oral presentations were held with
the three firms and Best and Final offers were submitted by each firm. Based upon the
evaluations of the written proposals, oral presentations, and the best and final offers, it was
determined that Housing Choice Partners (HCP) and Uhlich Children’s Advantage Network
(UCAN) will provide the best overall service and value to CHA for relocation services to ensure
that the necessary services are provided efficiently and effectively. Accordingly, the resolution
for Item C3 approves contract award to HCP and UCAN.
