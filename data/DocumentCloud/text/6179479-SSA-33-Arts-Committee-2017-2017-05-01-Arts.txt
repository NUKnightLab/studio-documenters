1. The committee discussed updates on on-going projects
a. One Big Thing- permit is in process
b. Wicker Tree- JW submitted proposal to the Park District, waiting to hear back, unsure of
the time it will take
2. The committee reviewed the proposals for Wicker Park Fest
a. Play Big by Andrea Jablonski and Laura Miracle- it is more activation than art, maybe
better for the kids area.
i. Substitute something else for the big jenga, instead of another game, can we up
the performance aspect?
ii. JW will follow up with the artist and learn more about the performance part
iii. The committee would love the whimsy of the bicycles as seen in the pictures.
b. Life’s a Balance, ChisTina Murphy- this would also be good for the kids area.
i. CR- it is whimsical, would like to see it on a platform
ii. Mary A.- it is safer on the ground in case people climb it
iii. DG- or it can go on a platform and have a do not touch sign
iv. Can we add barricades in the evening?
v. Mary A- there is some concern that it could invite “nasty pictures”
vi. DM- we have lights and could use them if there is power
Motion: to approve the funding of the “Play Big” and “Life’s a Balance” in the Wicker Park Fest Arts
Section in an amount not to exceed $10,000 from line item 2.06 (public art).
3. New Business:
a. DM would like to propose the installation of two pieces on platforms ( a steel plinth or
platform bolted to the sidewalk) that can be purchased outright or leased over for a
certain amount of time.
i. Mary A- this needs to come through a process
ii. JW will talk to Brent
iii. Mary A- this is a great idea, we could have an art walk, artists could sell their art,
we could be the venue to show it
iv. DG- the planters on North Ave would be a good location
