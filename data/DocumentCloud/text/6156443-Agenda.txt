PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT AMENDMENT
Department: Planning and Development
Other Part(ies): City of Chicago Heights
Request: Approval of an Amendment to the existing Joint Cooperation Agreement between Cook County and
the City of Chicago Heights
Goods or Services: Since 1993, Cook County and Chicago Heights have agreed to cooperate in undertaking
essential community development and housing assistance activities. Chicago Heights is a member of the Cook
County Urban County, whereby Cook County undertakes activities benefiting Chicago Heights and its residents
via federal grant resources from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Agreement Number: N/A
Agreement Period: Original effective date of 6/22/1993, with automatic renewals every three years unless one
party wishes to terminate.
Fiscal Impact: As a result of this agreement, additional HUD entitlement funding flows to Cook County via the
annual HUD formula grants. The amount of funding varies each year.
Accounts: Not applicable
Summary: Transmitted herewith is an Amendment to the existing Joint Cooperation Agreement between Cook
County and the City of Chicago Heights related to membership in Cook County’s Urban County for Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding. The Joint Cooperation Agreement, originally executed in 1993,
typically automatically renews every three years during the triennial Urban County requalification period that
Cook County is required to undertake by HUD, the source of the CDBG funding. For this cycle, HUD is
requiring that new language be added to all cooperation agreements. This amendment adds this new required
language to the existing agreement between Cook County and Chicago Heights. The Office of the State’s
Attorney has approved the Amendment as to form.
