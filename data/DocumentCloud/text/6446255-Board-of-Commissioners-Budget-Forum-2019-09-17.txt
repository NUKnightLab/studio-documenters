1 CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Contents

  

I am pleased to present the Chicago Park District’s 2019 Budget. This $464 million spending
plan affirms our continued commitment to investing in parks and neighborhoods, and serving
the children and families of Chicago.
The budget is a work of thorough and mindful analysis developed to drive our core values –
putting children first, offering the best deal in town, supporting a capital campaign that is “built
to last” and providing a staff that always makes the extra effort. Furthermore, the Chicago
Park District remains dedicated to the broader vision of investing in the lakefront, the Chicago
River, natural areas and recreational opportunities in each of Chicago’s 77 communities. The
2019 budget affords us the opportunity to continue with that mission.
As with past years’ budgets, this year will come with the introduction and expansion of new programming
available to all Chicagoans. From eco-recreation activities to aquatic safety outreach, to engaging teens in the
arts, community and environment, to expanding the wildly popular Nature Play Spaces with three new sites – the
Chicago Park District will provide programs that encourage all residents to stay active and engaged.
The 2019 spending plan is approximately $1.7 million higher the FY2018 adopted budget. When excluding the
internal reimbursements of $4.2 million, the recommended plan is a slight 0.4% increase over the adopted 2018
budget. Although we will observe a decrease in full time equivalent positions from the prior year, with appropriate
resource allocation and detailed staff right-sizing, we will continue to serve the needs of each community in
the best manner possible. Moreover, families in need will continue to have access to $3 million in financial
assistance – and as always, no child will be turned away from a Chicago Park District program. In addition to staff
realignment, the budget incorporates savings in landscape management and technology services, along with a
decreasing debt service. This budget positions us to continue to expand and grow in a financially responsible
manner for the good of all Chicago.
At $315 million, property taxes and personal property replacement tax make up the majority of Chicago Park
District revenues. Revenue growth also will come in the form of a property tax value capture for new properties,
as well as TIF expirations and terminations, continued healthy growth on investments and a strong special
event calendar at Soldier Field. Park fees will experience a minor increase, but programming will continue to be
affordable to all Chicagoans. This budget marks the seventh consecutive year we have reduced budgeted reliance
on prior year fund balance to address structural imbalance.
This promises to be a big year for us as we continue our march toward 2,020 acres of natural area by 2020, as
we open the doors at the world-class Gately Indoor Track & Field and as we celebrate the Chicago Park District’s
85th Anniversary.
From Brooks Park to Big Marsh Park to Garfield Park to the Lakefront Trail– north, south, west and east – our
mission and philosophy will never change. The Chicago Park District is committed to enhancing the quality of life
for Chicagoans in all neighborhoods, across every ward.
Sincerely,

Michael P. Kelly
General Superintendent & CEO
Chicago Park District

City of Chicago Demographics
The City of Chicago sits at the confluence of Lake Michigan with two rivers, the Chicago and Calumet. Covering an
area of 228 square miles, Chicago has utilized its beautiful setting to become the hub of the Midwest. Home to a
population of over 2.7 million, Chicago ranks as the third most populous city in the United States and the largest
in the interior of North America. A diverse metropolis of vibrant neighborhoods and over 600 parks, Chicago
offers residents and visitors alike an array of experiences found nowhere else.

Chicago Park District
As the green backdrop of the City, the Chicago Park District plays a prominent role in the Chicago experience.
The Chicago Park District is one of the largest municipal park managers in the nation, owning more than 8,800
acres of green space and offering a vast array of facilities and amenities for all ages and interests, including parks,
playgrounds, lakefront beaches, pools, cultural centers, fitness centers, golf courses, museums, and harbors to
name a few. Strong park systems are a key component in building strong cities. Investments in parks and play
are investments in communities as they provide spaces for children to play, neighbors to gather and community
bonds to form. Chicago’s park system has expanded dramatically over the years to add thousands of new acres,
millions of dollars in capital investment and thousands of events and program offerings. From basketball courts
and artificial turf fields at neighborhood parks to transformational projects such as the 312 River Run and the
Ford Calumet Environmental Center at Big Marsh Park, park capital improvements have the potential to touch the
lives of all City residents and visitors, knitting the fabric of the city closer together. For example, through Mayor
Rahm Emanuel’s Chicago Plays! playground initiative, we rebuilt 325 playgrounds across the city so that every
child in every neighborhood is within a 10-minute walk of a park or playground. Park programs and events create
hubs of positive activity, strengthening community ties and reducing crime.

The Chicago Park District oversees the Garfield Park Conservatory and the
Lincoln Park Conservatory, tropical paradises within the city that house
thousands of rare and exotic plants.  In addition, the Chicago Park District
oversees historic lagoons, plus bird and wildlife gardens.  From rich pond life
teeming with frogs, herons, and dragonflies, to shrubby areas where migratory
birds stop to rest, to lush prairies filled with native grasses and wildflowers,
the Chicago Park District offers many ways to explore nature in the city’s parks.
Popular attractions that fall under the management of the Chicago Park
District include the Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain, which is
located in Grant Park.  Proudly referred to as “Chicago’s front yard,” Grant
Park is among the city’s loveliest and most prominent parks. Eleven worldclass museums are located on Chicago Park District property, three of them
in Grant Park: the Art Institute, the Field Museum of Natural History and
the Shedd Aquarium. More than 20 million people visit Grant Park and
Buckingham Fountain annually, making it the second most visited park
landmark in the U.S. In addition to these landmarks, the Chicago Park
District offers hundreds of stunning facilities, many of which are rented for
special events.
Strengthening our focus on the natural environment, and eco-recreation as
a rapidly growing field within community recreation, total acreage increased
from 12,917 acres in 2017 to 13,547 acres in 2018, a nearly 5% increase.
Expanding our acreage with new acquisitions and development, as well as
taking over management of existing parkland, enables the Chicago Park
District to reach all of its residents and visitors with a variety of recreation
and leisure opportunities to choose from.

 Children First
Our most important role is to bring children and families into our parks and give them great reasons to stay and
play for a lifetime. One of our primary goals within this value is the development of new opportunities, while
expanding our most popular activities so that every child can experience all that we have to offer. In order to do
this, we routinely review enrollment statistics, solicit feedback from our guests and then use this data as a driver
to tailor our program offerings. We give every child a reason for, and
an opportunity to, play in the world-class parks we maintain.

In 2019, the Aquatics and
Sailing unit will expand
sailing offerings at Montrose
and Jackson Park Harbors.
Additionally, we will establish
Chicago-area high school
sailing teams, while also
expanding the racing team and
travel opportunities.

Best Deal in Town
We prioritize quality in our programs and accountability in our fiscal management to provide excellent and
affordable recreation that invites everyone to come out and play. To sustain our solid financial position for future
generations, we remain proactive in identifying new revenue sources, while at the same time making informed
investment decisions with our current resources and keeping operating costs at manageable levels. This multipoint approach allows us to maintain high quality programming, while keeping costs as affordable as possible.

In 2019, we will be allocating
additional resources toward
the management of strategic
partnerships that benefit the
District.
Looking at these
partnerships more holistically
will enable us to program more
effectively, while working to
keep rates affordable for all that
come to our parks. Developing a
consistent partnership model will
enable us to leverage non-financial
resources in the community for
the betterment of our guests.

 MISSION & CORE VALUES

Built to Last
We use our capital funding to renew our aging infrastructure in a sustainable manner and leverage partnerships
that produce new parks and facilities that are forward-thinking, environmentally sensitive and world-class. We
have inherited a world-class park system that has served generations of Chicagoans and it is our duty to ensure
the vitality endures. At the same time, we understand the need for ongoing maintenance of our prized assets and
expansion over time. These assets include fieldhouses, sculptures, landscapes and natural areas. To achieve this
end, we strategically utilized our capital resources, and leverage partnerships, to continually do more with less.
In doing so, we will honor our inheritance and build for the next generation.

Currently under construction, the Ford Calumet Environmental Center (FCEC) at Big Marsh Park is expected to
open to the public in the fall of 2019. Big Marsh is a Phoenix award-winning park bringing together ecological
restoration and active recreation. The FCEC will house classrooms, office and work space, a community
meeting and event space, as well as interpretive exhibits focused on the history of the region, environmental
education, and wetland ecology. The Center is intended to function as a gateway to the Calumet region and
will be the hub for school-based field trips, community programs, and eco-recreation activities for the over
740 acres of CPD natural sites on the southeast side.

park systems in the nation. To
commemorate this incredible
milestone, we will revisit historical
highlights, bring new investments
to our parks and engage our
patrons in a year-long celebration
of Chicago’s parks and how they’ve
shaped our families, communities
and city.

FINANCIAL POLICIES

Basis of Budgeting
The District’s annual budget is adopted on a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) budgetary basis for all
governmental funds except the debt service funds, which at the time of the issuance of bonds, shall provide for the levy
of taxes, sufficient to pay the principal and interest upon said bonds as per State code, and capital project funds, which
adopts project-length budgets. The legal level of budgetary control (i.e., the level at which expenditures may not exceed
appropriations) is at the fund and account class level.
The District’s department heads may make transfers of appropriations within a department. Any transfers necessary to
adjust the budget and implement park programs may be made by the District, as long as the changes do not require transfers
between account classes (common groupings of expenditures), and do not exceed the approved appropriation. Transfers of
appropriations between funds or account classes require the approval of the Board.
All annual appropriations lapse at fiscal year-end if they remain unused and unencumbered. Encumbrance accounting is
employed in governmental funds. Encumbrances (e.g., purchase orders, contracts) outstanding at year-end are reported
as an assignment of fund balance and do not constitute expenditures or liabilities because the commitments will be carried
forward and honored during the subsequent year.
As a rule, the District presents the annual budget on a modified accrual basis of accounting, with the exception of property
taxes. Budgetary Basis refers to the basis of accounting used to estimate financing sources and uses in the budget.
Modified Accrual is the method under which revenues and other financial resource increments are recognized when they
become susceptible to accrual; that is, when they become both “measurable” and “available to finance expenditures of the
current period.” “Available” means collectible in the current period or soon enough thereafter to be used to pay the liabilities
of the current period. This is different than the accrual basis which indicates revenues are recorded when they are earned
(whether or not cash is received at the time) and expenditures are recorded when goods and services are received (whether
cash disbursements are made at the time or not).
The District’s basis of budgeting is the same as GAAP basis except for the following: 1) in the budgetary basis, encumbrances
are expenditures, whereas GAAP reflects encumbrances as an assignment of fund balance; 2) for budget, the District classifies
as revenues both long-term debt proceeds and transfer-in, whereas GAAP classifies these as other financing sources; 3)
interfund revenues and expenditures are included on the budgetary basis but are eliminated for GAAP, and 4) encumbrances
are treated as expenditures in the year the encumbrance is established.

Budget Policy
The District operates on a calendar-year basis beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31. The adopted budget is
balanced, in that the budgeted expenditures do not exceed the anticipated revenue for the fiscal year. During the course of
the fiscal year, if there is a significant change to the budget, a supplemental appropriation will be submitted to the Board.
When a supplemental appropriation is submitted, the Board must give 10 days’ notice and hold a public hearing before
passage. Board action is required to make budget adjustments to transfer expenditure authority from one fund to another
and to make adjustments across account classes (i.e. from personnel services to contractual services).

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

 The Revenue Policy provides overall guidelines and structure for determining fees and managing other revenue sources
of the Chicago Park District. It is intended to be used as a guide to assist with responsible budgeting and long term fiscal
planning. Exceptions to these guidelines may be authorized, from time to time, after review by the General Superintendent
and his/her administrative staff. Annually, fees may be raised considering market conditions or in general alignment with the
Consumer Price Index. Fees are recommended by the General Superintendent and approved by the Board of Commissioners.
The Fee Schedule may be found in the Park District’s Annual Appropriation Ordinance. This policy does not apply to the
Property Tax Levy or PPRT. This policy applies to the following revenue sources:
• 

Activity/Membership Fees and Discounts
The Chicago Park District establishes these fees with the stated purpose of encouraging participation in our programs
and facilities, particularly among children and teenagers. Input is provided by local park staff to determine how a
park’s activities may be affordable by the local community. Because Chicago has such a wide and diverse economy, fee
structures may vary from community to community and local socio-economic factors may be considered.

• 

Permit Fees
The fee schedule is found within the Special Event Permit Application Package and Media Permit Application Package.
It is based on package pricing by event type and event features. Fees are relative to quantity of event attendance and
quantity/type of event features. Space assignments are made in this order, unless otherwise directed by the General
Superintendent, as deemed to be in the best interest of the Park District: 1) Chicago Park District Programs; 2) City of
Chicago Events (i.e. Jazz Fest, Air & Water Show); 3) Multi-year Use Agreements; 4) Open to general public; first comefirst serve.

• 

Facility Rentals
Fees are posted as hourly rates. Some locations may charge more during peak time of “weekend” (Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday). Youth rates are generally 50% of adult rates. Rental fees may vary from community to community with local
socio-economic factors taken into consideration. Space assignments are made in the same manner as permits.

• 

Management Agreements
These agreements are negotiated and awarded for the complete operation of a special facility(s). This type of agreement
is instituted when departmental operation(s) of the facility is either cost prohibitive or is not cost-effective; or when
the operation(s) require a level of expertise beyond the capabilities of Park District staff. The Park District receives a
percentage of the gross receipts and/or a minimum monthly rental rate. The length of terms and conditions of these
agreements may vary. All management agreements are subject to approval by the Board of Commissioners.

• 

Corporate Sponsorship and Advertising
The Chicago Park District (CPD) staff continually seeks corporate sponsorships for events, programs and facilities to
help increase non-tax revenue and enhance program offerings. These programs include the donation of funds, giftin-kind equipment/supplies or gift-in-kind services by the corporate partner in exchange for specific benefits. The
goal of the sponsorship program is to create long-lasting partnerships over multiple years. Corporate partners should
be selected based on sponsorship objectives that align with the mission, values and goals of the CPD. Corporate
sponsorship arrangements should adhere to the CPD established “Guidelines Relating to Sponsorship and Advertising
Agreements”. The Chicago Park District continues to identify assets suitable for sustainable advertising programs within
our properties that are valuable for revenue generation, respectful of our community spaces and adhere to the CPD
“Guidelines Relating to Sponsorship and Advertising Agreements”. Messaging and infrastructure must meet ordinance
regulations appropriate to the site and structure.

25 CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

FINANCIAL POLICIES

Revenue Policy

 FINANCIAL POLICIES

Debt Policy
The District manages its debt portfolio in accordance with State and Federal rules and regulations. Under applicable state
statutes, the District is governed in how it issues debt as well as limitations on the issuance of certain types of debt. Currently,
the District’s statutory general obligation bonded debt limitation is 2.3% of the latest known Equalized Assessed Valuation
(EAV). Currently, the District is $1,219 million or 69% below the $1,766 million state imposed limit.
The District is also subjected to a separate statutory debt limit of 1% of EAV for certain general obligation bonds issued
without referendum. The District has approximately $225 million in capacity under this limit. At the end of 2018, the
District’s outstanding long-term debt will be approximately $834 million, which is $13 million higher than the previous year
and will be reduced to approximately $799 million after the debt service payment due in 2019.

Investment Policy
The District invests public funds in a manner that is consistent with the all state and local statutes governing the investment
of public funds. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that ensures the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio.
The District shall diversify its investments to avoid incurring unreasonable risks associated with specific securities and/
or financial institutions. The investment portfolio must be sufficiently liquid to enable the District to meet all reasonable
anticipated operating requirements and must be designed to obtain a market average rate of return during budgetary and
economic cycles, taking into account the District’s investment risk constraints and cash flow needs.

Fund Balance Policy
Fund balance is the difference between assets and liabilities reported in a fund at the end of the fiscal year. The District
seeks to maintain adequate levels of fund balance to mitigate current and future risks and to ensure stability. Fund balance
is also a crucial consideration in long-term financial planning. Credit rating agencies carefully monitor levels of fund balance
and unassigned fund balances in the District’s General Fund to evaluate creditworthiness. Historically, the District has been
able to maintain a healthy reserve through growth management, strategic financial planning and constant cost analysis. It is
the policy of the District to maintain certain levels of fund balance in the Long-Term Income Reserve Fund to provide both
specificity and flexibility, while accomplishing two main criteria:
1.  Target Level of Reserve
The reserve floor is set at $85,000,000.
2.  Specific Circumstances for Drawing Down Reserve
Due to the biannual nature of our property tax collections, the District usually receives approximately half the tax levy
in the spring and the other half in the fall. This often creates a cash deficit as our peak spending is during the summer
months. Historically, the District would issue Tax Anticipation Warrants to bridge the gap. Internal borrowings from the
Reserve to the General Fund during the year are allowed for cash flow needs. The Reserve is to be repaid as the next
installment of property tax revenue is received.
Any other draw from the Reserve must be approved by the Board and should only be for nonrecurring expenditures or
one-time capital costs and not ongoing operational type expenditures.

Capital Asset Inventory Policy
Purchased or constructed capital assets are recorded at cost or estimated historical cost. Donated capital assets are recorded
as their fair value at the date of donation. The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the
asset or materially extend the assets’ lives are not capitalized.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

26

 The budget process is a culmination of input from District staff, management, the Board of Commissioners and community
members. All stakeholders have a role in shaping the District’s strategic direction. Each year, the District prepares the budget
document as a guide to communicate the District’s financial plan, policies, goals and objectives for the ensuing year. The
District has identified four core values to help guide our efforts for the future. The focus of these values is Children First, Best
Deal in Town, Built to Last and Extra Effort (discussed in detail under the section Mission & Core Values). District managers
develop specific program plans for their activities, as well as the framework of staff and support costs needed to carry out
these goals. This framework is the foundation for the District’s budget.
State code requires that the budget recommendations be submitted to the Board of Commissioners before November 1.
After providing at least seven days’ notice, the Board will hold a public hearing. The Board is to consider the budget and
make any amendments deemed necessary. The District Board of Commissioners must pass a balanced budget no later than
December 31.
Once the budget is passed, the Office of Budget and Management works with each Region and Department to manage the
adopted appropriations. Any transfers necessary to adjust the budget may be made by the Office of Budget and Management,
as long as the changes do not require transfers between account classes (common groupings of expenditures), and do not
exceed the approved appropriation. In either of those circumstances, requests for budget amendments must be brought
before the Board for approval.

27 CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

BUDGET PROCESS

Budget Process

 In 2011 the Government Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, GASB 54. GASB 54 required the Park
District to combine the Long Term Income Reserve and several other funds into the General Fund for reporting purposes
in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report beginning in fiscal year 2011. GASB 54 also required a breakdown of fund
balance into five classifications; Non-spendable, Restricted, Committed, Assigned and Unassigned. At December 31,
2017, the District’s governmental funds reported combined fund balances of $295 million, a decrease of $44.2 million
in comparison with the prior year. The unrestricted fund balance (the total of the committed, assigned, and unassigned
components of fund balance) for the general fund was $207.8 million, or approximately 69.8% of total general fund
expenditures. Of this amount, $96 million relates to working cash reserves.
The 2019 budget accounts for the use of $1.5 million of prior year fund balance. This is a decrease of $0.5 million
compared to the 2018 budget. This marks the seventh consecutive year of reduction of budgeted reliance on prior year
fund balance in an effort to address the structural imbalance.

The Long-Term Income Reserve Fund
The long-term reserve fund is a special revenue fund created in 2006 with total proceeds from the sale of the District’s
parking garages. Interest earned on these proceeds is budgeted to replace the net operating income the District had
been receiving from the garages. It is the District’s policy to maintain the fund level at no less than $85 million. At the
end of 2017, the fund balance was $96 million. Interfund transfers from the corporate fund replenish money drawn from
this fund to maintain the $85 million minimum.

BUDGET OVERVIEW

Economic Outlook
As fiscal year 2018 comes to a close, the national economy is growing at a steady pace. Recent data indicate
growth in the economy with real GDP increasing at an annual rate of 3.5% in the third quarter of 2018 (advance
estimate) and 4.2% percent in the second quarter. The overall economy grew at an average rate of 3.3% in
2018, up from an average of 2.5% in 2017. The US Department of Labor reported that the seasonally-adjusted
national unemployment rate declined from 4.1% in October 2017 to 3.7% in October 2018. The overall labor
force participation rate rose in October to 62.9%, a 0.2% increase from the previous year. Over the past nine
years, the economy has been in expansion, but slower economic momentum is anticipated in 2019 as the effects
of the 2018 federal tax cuts and $1.3 trillion spending bill are likely to wind down.
The state and local economy have historically followed the economic gain patterns of the national economy. In
September 2018, the preliminary unemployment rate for Illinois was 4.1%, down from 4.6% a year prior, and
the unemployment rate for Chicago was 3.7%, down from 4.7% a year earlier. According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS), from September 2017 to September 2018 nonfarm payroll employment increased by 50,300
jobs throughout Illinois. Most of the jobs were concentrated in the Chicago area, with the Chicago-NapervilleArlington Heights area accounting for 23,600 jobs in that period. The largest job losses were in Springfield, IL and
Carbondale-Marion, IL, with such areas losing 800 and 700 jobs respectively.
After multiple years without a state budget, the Illinois General Assembly passed a $38.5 billion budget in 2018.
While the current budget is balanced, concerns persists on whether the spending and revenue estimates are
realistic, as the budget assumes that a proposed pension buy-out will lead to savings of $382 million and an
additional $300 million will be generated from the sale of the James R. Thompson Center. There is also criticism
that the budget is not reformative because it fails to address a backlog of unpaid bills which presently stand at
$7.5 billion. These uncertainties at the state level leave local governments in a difficult situation as they prepare
to effectively plan for the future.
With a labor force of about 4.7 million, the economy of the Chicago Metropolitan area continues to be strong
and is among the largest and most diversified in the world. Chicago is the home to many major businesses and
Fortune 500 companies. The annual gross regional product (GRP) in 2017 was $657.59 billion, which is a 1%
increase from $651 billion in 2016. Tourism continues to be a driving force in the local economy, setting records
in 2018. From January through June, overall visitors rose 4.4%, with overnight visitors up 6%. Additionally, hotel
demand grew 5% in the first three quarters. These statistics are testament to Chicago’s status as Conde Nast
Traveler’s Best Big City in the U.S., an honor we recently received for the second year in a row.
One of the prominent drivers in the Chicago economy is the Chicago Park District, employing close to 7,260
employees and paying over $190 million in wages and compensation. About half of these jobs are summer
employment opportunities that set the stage for personal and professional development, allowing young adults
to reinvest in their communities and positively impact the local economy. For the upcoming year, the District will
continue this focus by opening the Ford Calumet Environmental Center (FCEC) at Big Marsh Park in the Calumet
Region. This new facility on Chicago’s southeast side will not only provide programming opportunities for youth
and teens, but it will help bolster the local economy of the Calumet area by attracting residents and tourists alike
to the area to enjoy hiking, rock climbing, adventure courses, trail running and off-road biking. As we go into our
85th year, we will continue to invest in our world-class resources, while expanding to meet the diverse needs of
our patrons.

 Tax Revenues
The Park District’s largest source of revenue is the property tax which makes up 59% of total resources. While
the District has been fortunate with stable property tax collections, this budget reflects a conservative estimate
in the expected loss in collections of 3.67% of the property tax which is consistent with prior years’ actual losses.
The 2019 gross property tax levy of $286.1 million reflects $1.5 million in capture of the value of new property
and expiring/terminating TIF districts which provides additional resources to the District without increasing the
tax burden on residents. Net property tax after expected loss in collections is $275.6 million.
The property tax is determined by dividing the levy by the equalized assessed value (EAV) of the taxable net
property in the City of Chicago. There are a variety of restrictions on the tax levy. By Illinois statute, the portion
of the levy going to the corporate fund is limited to 66 cents per $100 of EAV. The portion going to the aquarium
and museum fund is limited to a maximum of 15 cents per $100 of EAV; and 4 cents per $100 of EAV going to the
special recreation fund.
In March of 1995, property tax cap limitations were passed by the state legislature, which reflect the District’s
tax levy. The portion of the levy which supports the operations of parks and recreation facilities (the aggregate
extension) can only increase from year to year by the rate of inflation. In prior years the portion of the levy
supporting debt service is limited to the level of the 1994 debt service levy. Thus, the District can only issue
general obligation bonds where the debt service falls within that restriction. In 2009 state legislation was changed
to allow debt service to increase by the lesser of CPI (Consumer Price Index) or 5%. The 2019 budget will fall
within these restrictions.
The Park District represents one of seven taxing jurisdictions on City residents’ bills. According to the most recent
report released by the Cook County Clerk’s Office, 4.93% is allocated to the Chicago Park District. On a typical
resident’s bill, this amounts to approximately $200 to support parks.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

36

 PPRT is a tax on the net income of corporations that is collected at the state level and distributed to municipalities
and districts statewide according to a defined formula. The Chicago Park District allocates its portion of PPRT
toward the debt service fund, the pension fund, the aquarium and museum fund and the corporate fund, in that
order of funding priority.
According to the Illinois Department of Revenue’s Fiscal Year 2019 Estimate for Replacement Taxes, allocations
to the 6,500 local taxing districts which are entitled to receive an allocation of PPRT are estimated at $1,142
million, a decline of 7% from fiscal year 2018 replacement tax allocations. Fiscal year 2018 actual PPRT revenues
were higher than originally projected due to some one-time only federal tax changes. The State’s annual
reconciliation of tax payments and returns will result in a fiscal year 2019 transfer of approximately $38 million
from replacement tax to income tax. The statutory refund fund transfer from the Personal Property Replacement
Tax Fund to the Refund Fund is $28.7 million because in fiscal year 2018 replacement tax refunds paid were more
than replacement tax refund revenues. The business income tax refund fund percentage has decreased from
17.5% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 15.5% in Fiscal Year 2019. Lastly, Public Act 100-0586 authorized $302.4 million in
expenditures out of the PPRT fund for fiscal year 2019. Based on the state’s estimate, its practice of diverting
funds to other needs and the volatile nature of corporate profits, the District will continue to take a conservative
outlook. In 2019, PPRT revenue is projected to generate $39.4 million for the District which represents no growth
from the 2018 budget. In addition, the District will maintain the $5 million PPRT stabilization reserve created in
2012 to minimize the impact of economic downturns on the budget.

Grants, Donations and Sponsorships
Partnerships are vital to the District’s operations. The Park District has continued to count on generous
private donations, corporate sponsorships, and grants from Federal, State of Illinois, City of Chicago, and local
organizations. These one-time revenue sources help alleviate the District’s expense burden for capital projects
and operating programs. In receiving outside funding, the District is able distribute resources to the Chicago
community in greater amounts.
Outside operating grants, donations, and sponsorships fund innovative programs including Night Out in the
Parks, Special Olympics, and summer camp scholarships. Capital grants and donations fund projects including
new parks and fieldhouses, historic facility renovations, and new natural areas and playgrounds. In the past five
years, the District has been successful in obtaining an average of nearly $40 million per year in outside funding
toward District priorities, not including in-kind grants and donations. As of fall 2018, over $27.7 million in outside
funding has been awarded this year with additional grant awards expected by year-end.

Major federal government contributions in 2018 to the Chicago Park District included the U.S. Department of
Agriculture funding to support the Summer Food Program ($2.6 million) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Coastal Management grant to improve the wildlife habitat along Chicago’s north lakefront. U.S. Veteran Affairs
provided a grant of $90,000 to support the 2018 Midwest Valor Games after not receiving funding for a few
years. Also in 2018, the City of Chicago provided over $9.3 million through TIF and OSIF programs for various park
improvements around the city including new dog friendly areas at multiple parks, and a new artificial turf field
and track at Dunbar Park. Furthermore, city aldermen collectively provided $1.3 million in Menu funds for park
capital projects which included new playgrounds, courts, and ballfield improvements.
In addition to governmental funds, generous private funding of more than $6 million in 2018 was vital to
sustaining our District programs and capital priorities. The Barack Obama Foundation provided $3.5 million for
a new artificial turf track and field in Jackson Park. In addition, the Jim Gordon Philanthropic Fund announced a
generous gift of nearly $10 million to support theater and cultural programming across the District for the next
10 years.

Soldier Field

The District contracts with a vendor to manage and operate Soldier Field. This contractor collects revenue from
events at Soldier Field, as well as income from non-event parking at the Soldier Field parking lots. In addition to
event revenue generated by the contractor, the gross revenue amount reflects the rent collected at the stadium
and the annual operating subsidy from the ISFA. Revenue collected from Soldier field has steadily increased over
the years making it the largest non-tax revenue source for the District. During 2018, Soldier Field hosted a variety
of major events, including 6 large concert nights, international soccer, international rugby, major college football
and the Chinese Lantern Festival. Numerous exciting events are anticipated to be held in 2019, including major
musical acts, international soccer and Cirque du Soleil, which will increase gross revenues by 2.4% to $35.2 million. At the same time, gross expenses are expected to increase by 1.5% to a total of $19.8 million.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

42

 Prior to 2007, parking revenue was primarily income generated from the Downtown Parking Garage System that is
now part of a long-term lease agreement finalized in 2006. The District entered into a multi-year agreement with
a vendor to manage the remainder of the District’s Parking System in 2009. The vendor manages the installation
and maintenance of pay & display units and collection of revenues generated by the District’s parking system.
Total parking revenue did not meet the original 2018 budget projections due to increased competition from ride
sharing programs. As a result we are anticipating a slight decrease to $5.9 million in 2019, while gross expenses
will remain steady at $1.2 million. Parking rates will remain reasonable compared to neighboring paid parking
options.

bunker renovations at Columbus Park and Marquette Park, and finishing the irrigation project at Robert Black.

generation. For 2019, a conservative outlook is warranted based on recent spring weather. As a result, gross

MSC is home to year-round competitive and recreational ice skating, hockey, tennis and fitness programming.
In addition, in 2018 a new studio-size ice rink was completed to increase skating programs. A full year of the
new rink will increase gross revenue at MSC to $2.9 million, along with gross expense to $2.1 million. BMPSC
features a state-of-the-art gymnastics center, a fitness studio and a variety of on-ice programs for children and
adults, from learn-to-skate classes to advanced ice skating techniques. Revenues and expenses at BMPSC are

This category includes revenue from room/gym/facility rentals and permit fees for events held on District property.
The Park District will continue to focus on identifying ways to increase non-tax revenue streams, such as permit
revenue from large-scale events, in order to keep fees for our park programs affordable and minimize reliance
on the property tax to grow programs. The District continues to implement efficiencies to the permit process
and work with permit applicants to identify suitable sites for events beyond those most in-demand. In 2019, the
District will conduct a comprehensive review of permit fee rates to ensure fees are set in a manner to support
the mission of the District and to better reflect our numerous multifaceted space offerings. Rental and permit

 Other Resources

At 27% of this category, internal service earnings represents incoming reimbursements between funds. To
avoid double counting, the Financial Summary table deducts internal service earnings between funds from
total resources to more accurately reflect the total net appropriation. In FY19, the internal service earnings
amount is calculated at $4.2 million to reimburse the corporate fund from the special recreation fund for indirect
expenses. At 25% of this category, contribution of capital assets represents the total amount that qualifies as
capital expenditures and are funded by bond proceeds. In FY19, this amount is calculated at $3.9 million. Lastly,
use of prior year fund balance is the portion of the balance from prior fiscal years that will be relied upon in FY19.
The FY19 budget accounts for the use of $1.5 million of prior year fund balance. This is a decrease of $0.5 million
compared to the 2018 budget. This marks the seventh consecutive year of reduction of budgeted reliance on
prior year fund balance in an effort to address the structural imbalance.

The 2019 budget allocates resources for a total of 3,180 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions. This includes
fulltime, hourly and seasonal positions. Since 2008, the District has decreased its FTE count by 106 FTE positions
despite an increase in program offerings, facilities and acreage. In 2019, the District will increase its FTE count in
certain areas, right size in other areas and reallocate resources to maintain services in the most efficient manner
possible. The District will allocate additional staffing resources toward the following:
•  New and expanded facilities at Williams Park, Maplewood Park, and the Ford Calumet Environmental Center
(FCEC) at Big Marsh Park
•  Natural area acreage growth toward the District’s 2020 goal
•  Sailing program growth
•  Outdoor & Environmental Education programming
•  Sponsorship and partnership management
•  Diversity management
Overall, the District will decrease its FTE count by 27 and achieve $1.3 million in savings from personnel efficiencies.

2018

2019

 EXPENSE

Health, Dental, and Life Insurance
At $23.2 million, health, dental and life insurance benefit expenses make up 5% of the District’s budget. Each
year the District must absorb more of the escalating expense related to health benefits. In 2019 the District will
face increased healthcare costs due to overall growth trends in health and prescription drug expenses. Since
2014, the District has made it a priority to seek out and implement ways to mitigate this trend and based on
the slowing rate of expense growth, these management efficiencies are paying off. For example, in 2019 the
District will benefit from favorable prescription drug contract terms achieved through a multi-agency competitive
procurement process carried out in 2018.

Pension

Total pension expenses, including the required employer contribution and the voluntary supplemental contribution,
account for 6% or $27.6 million of the 2019 budget representing level funding toward the fund compared to the
2018 budget despite statutory changes in pension legislation decreasing the pension obligation of the District.
Pension reform changes passed in 2014 under Public Act 098-0622 were subsequently challenged and ultimately
overturned. On March 1, 2018, the Circuit Court of Cook County issued an order ruling that the challenged
provisions of the pension reform are unconstitutional because these provisions diminish and impair pension
benefits in violation of Section 5 of Article XIII of the Illinois Constitution which the Illinois Supreme Court has ruled
prohibits the diminishment and impairment of pension benefits. As a result, the Court directed the Pension Fund
to pay back the increased employee contributions totaling approximately $4 million. Based on the severability
clause contained in the act, the unchallenged provisions were also held unconstitutional but an Agreed Order
supported by all parties permitted the Pension Fund to retain the increased and supplemental contributions of
the District that were made from 2015-2017.
The adopted 2018 Budget Appropriation reflected an employer pension contribution requirement of $27.6 million
in compliance with the pension reform legislation in effect at the time which incorporated an increased multiplier
of 2.30 times the amount of employee contributions. The appropriable revenues to fund this appropriation
included a property tax levy of $24.6 million and an allocation of Personal Property Replacement Tax (PPRT) funds
of $3 million. The March 2018 Court ruling declared the pension reform act unconstitutional in its entirety thereby
reverting the multiplier back to 1.10 and mandating that the 2018 budgeted property tax levy be amended to the
1.10 multiplier. The amended formula resulted in a reduction to the employer pension contribution requirement
and associated property tax levy for pension purposes. The District did not seek to reduce the total 2018
appropriated amount to the Fund and instead amended the 2018 Budget Appropriation to decrease the property
tax levy portion toward pension in compliance with the Court order while adding a supplemental contribution
toward the pension fund funded by PPRT.
The District’s position continues to be that pension changes are critical to ensuring retirement security for our
current employees and retirees by taking the necessary steps to raise the funded ratio of the pension fund. In
support of this position, the 2019 budget reflects the required employer pension contribution of $14.6 million as
required by the reverted pension formula but also reflects a voluntary supplemental contribution of $13 million.
Even though the District is now contributing more than double the amount it is required to under the statute,
the actuarially required contribution necessary to avoid insolvency is double this amount. Therefore, the District
continues to work diligently with its labor partners on crafting long-term solutions on the pension.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

 Debt Service

EXPENSE

At 15%, debt services make up the second largest expense for the District. Debt service relates to the payments
made for principal and interest on general obligation long-term debt. Debt service expenses are budgeted to
decrease by $1.7 million in 2019 due to a downward sloping debt profile.

Utilities

As part of a comprehensive approach to achieve utility conservation and efficiencies, the District developed an
energy risk management plan for natural gas and electricity that accounts for factors such as load profile, supply
and demand factors, market analytics, current hedges and other factors to further achieve cost savings. To date,
the plan has proven successful in achieving results with $1.6 million per year in natural gas supply savings and
$1.4 million per year in electric commodity price component savings. The 2019 budget assumes a continuation
of this trend with natural gas and electricity expenses declining by $0.4 million.
The District has incurred substantial increases in water/sewer fee charges due to a multi-year water/sewer rate
increase imposed by the City of Chicago starting in 2012 that caused water/sewer charges paid by the District
to more than double. In 2017, the City of Chicago began charging water and sewer taxes in addition to water/
sewer fees. These fee and tax rates are scheduled to increase annually under the existing City ordinance. To
combat these increases, the District has embarked on a comprehensive districtwide water conservation effort
that includes a leak and infrastructure review and assessment of water features that are both environmentally
and economically inefficient. The District has been successful in slowing the growth trend in this expense and will
continue these efforts in 2019 to contain expense growth to $0.5 million.
Total utility-related expenses in 2019 are expected to be $31.5 million which is $0.1 million higher than 2018.

Managed Assets

The District’s managed assets, including Soldier Field, harbors, concessions, paid parking spaces, golf courses,
Northerly Island concert venue, MLK Family Entertainment Center, McFetridge Sports Center, Beverly Morgan
Park Sports Complex, Maggie Daley Park and others, represent 11% of total expenses in 2019 which is $0.2 million
higher than 2018. A full discussion of managed assets may be found in the revenue section of this summary.

53 CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

 Through a unique partnership, the Chicago Park District provides operating subsidies to Museums In the Park
(MIP). MIP is a partnership among Chicago's leading museums located on Chicago Park District property. The
MIP represent the best of the visual arts, sciences, and humanities. Together, they engage, educate, and broaden
the life experiences of millions of Chicagoans each year through diverse on-site programming, innovative
neighborhood partnerships, and interactive web-based learning. The MIP is comprised of the following
institutions: John G. Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, The Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago History Museum,
DuSable Museum of African American History, The Field Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art, Museum of
Science and Industry, National Museum of Mexican Art, Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum and Institute of Puerto
Rican Arts and Culture. The operating subsidy to MIP is allocated out of the Park District’s property tax levy and
7.534% of PPRT as mandated by state law. In 2019, $29.6 million will be budgeted for this purpose.

The Park District also provides funding for the Lincoln Park Zoo. In 2019, $5.6 million is earmarked to support
the Lincoln Park Zoo. Collectively the remittance to the aquarium, museums and zoo make up 8% of the total
expenses in the 2018 operating budget.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

56

 The District’s financial team maintains a 3-year forecast for fiscal planning. This living document reflects the results
of regular monitoring of the economy and operations on the District’s long-term finances. The District has been
credited for its prudent and conservative approach to financial management and is committed to maintaining
this position. Toward this effort, in 2019 the District will reduce its reliance on the prior year fund balance, the
seventh year of consecutive reductions, and employ a number of initiatives to decrease expenses and increase
revenue to close a budget deficit of $14 million and hold year-over-year budget increases to a mere 0.4%. These
initiatives are detailed throughout this summary and reflect the difficult work of meeting the demands of park
patrons while living within our means.

LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLAN

Long-Term Financial Planning

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Capital Improvement Plan
The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) is the District’s comprehensive multi-year plan for land acquisition and
park development, new building construction, building and facility management, park site improvements, and
technology and major equipment. The CIP outlines the projects that are expected to take place over the next five
years. Capital projects typically have costs of over $10,000, have a life expectancy of at least 5 years, and may
result in the creation of a capital asset.
The Capital Improvement Plan is a dynamic and evolving guide for spending over a five-year period. The CIP
outlines spending priorities and expected schedules and is formed to allow for adjustment over the five-year
period. The CIP allows for flexibility, for instance, if actual project expenses are above (or below) a projected
budget in the CIP, as new outside funding is granted for specific projects or programs, or as new district priorities
develop. The CIP is published annually to reflect the growth of the Plan each year.

Capital Improvement Plan Process
Throughout the year, the Park District compiles
requests for capital improvements from numerous
sources. External requests generally come from
annual budget hearings, letters, emails, website
inquiries, legislators, advisory councils, board
meetings, community groups, city agencies, new
laws, unfunded mandates, and other similar sources.
Internal requests are typically derived from park
inspections, facility assessments, the work order
system, framework plans, policy initiatives, strategic
objectives, and needs identified by recreation, culture,
service, planning, construction, and maintenance
departments.
The requests are bundled into programs and
sub-programs that reflect a shared project type.
Establishing programs and sub-programs help us to
compare similar projects. Projects that are primarily
paving work, for example, are organized first into a
program called "site improvements" then second into
a sub-program called "paving".

Capital projects range from building new or
renovating fieldhouses and swimming pools to
installing new pathways and park benches to
planting new trees and natural areas. Above:
South Shore Culltural Center major renovation
project.

Once the requests are organized, an internal working group investigates, analyzes, and weighs each request. This
group includes representatives from each of the departments responsible for implementing the capital plan:
Planning and Development, Capital Construction, Facility Maintenance, Natural Resources, Green Initiatives,
Information Technology, Budget, and the Office of the Chief Operating Officer. Investigations occur throughout
the year. From request compilation to prioritization, internal review spans approximately six months.

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

58

 After investigation and research, the working
group weighs projects against others in the
same sub-program. This analysis takes into
consideration the following typologies:
projects that are urgent, high-priority that
should be undertaken if possible; highpriority projects that should be done if
funding becomes available; worthwhile
projects to be considered if funding becomes
available; and desirable, but not essential,
low-priority projects. To understand the
continuum of need, an "urgent, highpriority" request might be replacing a broken
water main; a "desirable, but not essential"
request might be a new floral garden. Part
of this process also includes examining the
distribution of past and proposed projects
and funds across the District relative to the
geographic, legislative, and demographic
characteristics of the City.
The total estimated cost of the Capital Plan
and its individual projects must fall within
the anticipated funds available. This places
limits on the number of projects that can
be addressed in a given year. The working
group's Capital Plan recommendation to the
General Superintendent must stay within
adopted financial constraints.

Capital projects completed in 2018 include: a climbing wall at
Steelworker’s Park and new playgrounds in Munroe Park and Gill
Park.

The five-year term of the District's Plan allows
the District to maintain long-term fiscal
health, lend stability to capital investment
planning, meet longer term goals and
objectives, establish meaningful timelines
for projects, and make clear to the public the
District's future investment intentions.

59 CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

The working group’s first step is investigation.
Each capital request is investigated to
determine the scope, estimated cost, and
comparative need for the project. This
investigation is combined with research into
the source, context, prior assessments, and
institutional knowledge of the park and its
facilities.

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Capital Improvement Funding Sources

General Obligation Bond
Historically, the District issues approximately $30-$40 million annually in G.O. Bonds for capital improvements.
In 2018, the Board of Commissioners approved $33 million in bond funding for capital projects in 2019. For
the years 2019-2023, it is estimated that $153 million in general obligation bonds will be issued to fund capital
improvement projects.
Harbor Bond
In 2018, the District plans to issue a new harbor improvement bond in an amount not to exceed $8 million. These
funds will be used for dock and gate replacement as well as other capital improvements to our nine existing
harbors along the Chicago Lakefront.
Special Recreation Assessment Bond
The Special Recreation Assessment (SRA) levy,
is part of the District’s annual property tax. This
SRA levy assessment generates approximately $12
million to support the special recreation operations
and programming as well as complementary capital
improvements.
Parking Garage Lease Revenue
In 2006, the Board of Commissioners approved the
transfer of three downtown parking garages to the
City of Chicago. The City of Chicago then entered
into a 99-year lease of the garages, resulting in
$347.8 million in proceeds for the District. $122
million of these proceeds were reserved for capital
improvements to neighborhood parks. The residual
balance is primarily used for project development
where tax-exempt financing is not an eligible
source, such as the District’s concession areas.

Outside funding is vital to the park capital plan. These funds
alleviate pressure on District bond funding and provide desired
projects around the city. Pictured are three capital projects
completed in 2018 with outside partners. Above is Norwood
Park with the Chicago Blackhawks and Walnut Park with the
U.S. Soccer Foundation. Left is Washington Park with the U.S.
Tennis Association.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Outside Funding
Federal, State of Illinois, City of Chicago, and private grants and donations are essential to the success of many
capital projects. Nearly half of the capital plan is funded with outside partners. Outside funding has been
especially important in the development of new park lands, construction of new field houses, installation of new
artificial turf fields, and renovation of playgrounds.

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

2019-2023 Capital Improvement Plan
Planning for the 2019-2023 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is underway. Expected sources for the 5-year
program include $155 million in new G.O. Bond and $131.4 million in outside funding. The Capital Improvement
Program is a living document, and additional outside funding is expected to be identified and committed for
projects within the years 2019-2023. The Chicago Park District continues to actively seek additional outside
grants, donations, and sponsorships for the 2019-2023 CIP.

Building on Burnham – Capital Project Highlights
As opportunities arise in our existing urban environment, the Chicago Park District strives to acquire and develop
new quality parkland around our City. These projects are major investments that require strong financial and
community partnerships.
Major investments in the 2019-2023 Capital Improvement Plan follow Mayor Emanuel’s Building on Burnham
Plan, a comprehensive plan to guide park investment into four key program areas: the Lakefront, the Chicago
River, natural areas, and new community recreational opportunities.
With the 2016 launch of Building on Burnham Plan Mayor Emanuel stated, “Daniel Burnham’s vision has guided
the growth of Chicago for more than a century and made us known as the City in a Garden. This new strategy
builds on both the work we’ve done over the last four years and Burnham’s plan to help ensure that the City in
a Garden is within reach of every child of Chicago. In this way, we can ensure that our children make no little
plans – because we want their dreams and their futures to be unlimited.”
Highlights on these initiatives are provided in the following pages:

CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

 Attracting millions of visitors every year, Chicago’s 26-mile Lakefront is central to providing key open space
and recreational opportunities to both Chicago residents and tourists from around the world. The Building
on Burnham Plan reaches beyond the existing successes of the Lakefront to make the park space even more
accessible and inviting for users. One
major project underway is the Lakefront
Trail (LFT) Separation. Funded through
a generous $12 million private grant, the
trail system will be redesigned to separate
faster moving bicycle traffic apart from
slower moving pedestrian traffic. By the
end of 2018, the final sections of paving
will be complete with some site and
landscape improvements to be finished in
Spring 2019.
Additionally, access to the Lakefront
is being transformed.
The City of
Chicago Department of Transportation is
constructing a new pedestrian and bicycle
access bridge at 41st street. This new
bridge is the second of five bridge projects
to improve access to the lakefront on the
City’s south side. A replacement bridge
was completed at 35th Street in 2016, and
additional projects at 31st, 39th and 43rd
Streets are in the works. These key access
points provide residents of the Douglas,
Oakland and Kenwood communities much
needed safe, convenient, and separated
from vehicular traffic choices to get to the
lakefront for recreation, enjoyment and
commuting.

Trail separation is in the final stage of construction along the
length of the Lakefront Trail.

Lakefront access bridges at 41st Street and 43rd Street.

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

The Chicago River
Following on the success of Chicago’s Lakefront improvements, the next step of the Building on Burnham Plan
looks to transform Chicago’s Riverfront into an amenity just as popular and important for Chicagoans. Plans
and investments focus on transforming the Chicago River and adjacent properties into a recreation destination,
providing at least one point of access to the riverfront along every mile of the river starting from the city limits on
the north to the Little Village neighborhood on the south, all while promoting habitat restoration.
In the 2019-2023 CIP there are major habitat and riverbank restoration projects along the riverfront. In partnership
with the Chicago Department of Transportation, a new elevated pedestrian and bicycle trail, named Riverview
Bridge, is under construction over the Chicago River and a new pedestrian/bicycle underpass is planned for
construction under Irving Park Road. The new bridge and underpass, part of the 312 RiverRun trail, will provide
new pedestrian and bicycle connections along the river from Clark Park on the south end to Horner Park on the
north end and is expected to be completed in 2019.

The new 312 RiverRun provides new access along and over the Chicago River.

Additionally, a new project at River Park is now underway. This River Riparian Restoration project is a partnership
with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Metropolitan Water Reclamation District and focuses on removing an
existing dam and grading and planting the river edge to improve habitat and recreational opportunity in the river.
The dam will be removed in 2018 with river edge improvements continuing into 2019.

Natural Areas
Natural areas are unique open spaces focused
on restoring the connection between people
and nature. These mostly passive spaces are
dedicated to the cultivation and enrichment of
ecological diversity and to providing health and
wellness opportunities. Natural area habitats
include prairie, wetland, woodland, dunes,
lagoons, and native gardens. Natural areas can be
found throughout Chicago’s parks, ranging in size
from 0.25 acres to 278 acres.
The Chicago Park District manages 99 natural areas
throughout the City, consisting of over 1,850 acres
and representing more than 21% of total park
acreage. Under the leadership of Mayor Rahm
Emanuel, the amount of natural areas has more
than doubled in Chicago, increasing over 1,150
acres since 2011. Under the Mayor’s Building on
Burnham Plan, our new goal is to have 2,020 acres
of natural areas district-wide in the City of Chicago
by the year 2020.
In 2018, more site improvements such as nature
play spaces, pathways, fencing, and seating
have been included in natural areas to allow for
easier exploration. Additional acreage has been
identified for future conversion to high quality
natural areas. With work continuing through the
2019-2023 CIP, we will increase the footprint of
existing natural areas to allow for greater habitat
diversity, better ecosystem services and a better
opportunity to “get lost in nature.”

New natural areas, such as the Nature Play area at
Welles Park and the Marian Byrnes nature area
shown in the images above, can provide habitat
improvement as well as new recreational and
educational opportunities.

65 CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT   2019 BUDGET SUMMARY

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Recreational Opportunities
Recreational assets and programming for
children and families in every neighborhood
will remain a core program for the Chicago
Park District under the Building on Burnham
Plan. Through expanded partnerships with our
sister agencies including the Chicago Public
Schools and Chicago Housing Authority, we
aim to provide new recreational opportunities
not yet available in the city limits.
In the 2019-2023 Capital Improvement Plan,
one such opportunity is a new indoor track
and field at Gately Park in Chicago’s Pullman
and Roseland Communities. This new facility
will assist in revitalizing track and field in the
Chicago area. The 140,000 square foot track
and field facility will be designed to host
championship level meets and will have a
3,500 seating capacity. The site will also host a
new local campus for After School Matters. The
facility is currently under construction.
Another major new recreational destination
is the Ford Calumet Environmental Center in
Big Marsh. Currently underway, this facility
will be a hub for nature and eco-recreation
programming for all of Chicago. Located in the
southeast side of Chicago, exhibition space will
focus on the cultural and industrial history of
the area as well as habitat, environmental and
eco-recreation education.
Additionally, development at Addams Park for
a new 100,000 sq. ft. indoor recreation center
that will feature an indoor practice track,
artificial turf field, multi-purpose courts, club
room and other amenities is underway. This
project’s expected completion is late 2019.
Throughout the District, the 2019-2023 capital
improvement program plans for new artificial
turf fields, tennis court rehabs and conversions,
playgrounds, outdoor fitness stations and
other site improvements throughout the
neighborhoods of Chicago.

 The District manages its debt portfolio in accordance with State and Federal rules and regulations. Under
applicable state statutes, the District is governed in how it issues debt as well as limitations on the issuance of
certain types of debt. Currently, the District’s statutory general obligation bonded debt limitation is 2.3% of the
latest known Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV). Currently, the District is $1,219 million or 69% below the $1,766
million state imposed limit.
The District is also subjected to a separate statutory debt limit of 1% of EAV for certain general obligation bonds
issued without referendum. The District has approximately $225 million in capacity under this limit. At the end of
2018**, the District’s outstanding long-term debt will be approximately $834 million, which is $13 million higher
than the previous year and will be reduced to approximately $799 million after the debt service payment due in
2019.

Accomplishments
Core Value: Children First
• 
• 

Increased the Teen X-Stream summer camp initiative by expanding the program from 30 locations in 2017 to 34 in 2018
with over 500 teen participants. The Teen X-Stream is now a district- wide initiative.
Customized our program offerings for after school, weekends and for school holidays and for when school is out for
public school children.

Core Value: Best Deal in Town
• 

• 

Created new programming opportunities for seniors and adults through activities and special events during times that
parks are less utilized.  The Region held the first ever senior pickleball tournament at Fosco Park on April 6th with nearly
50 senior participants. Following the tournament on May 11th, Ellis Park hosted a pickleball clinic with ambassadors
from the USAPA pickleball association where 50 seniors from beginner to intermediate skill levels participated.
Continuing to add quality park programs and special events, the AileyCamp, specialty dance camp, was again a summer
feature at Douglas Park.  Nearly 1,000 patrons enjoyed the captivating performances of some 100 camp performers.
Teens from 6 park locations participated in the "We Walk for Water", a fundraising event to bring awareness to the need
for clean drinking water in various 3rd world countries and also certain locales in the USA. Their collective efforts raised
over $1,700 dollars.

Core Value: Built to Last
• 

The Nancy Lieberman Foundation donated a new basketball sports court at Ohio and Harding Avenue in the West
Humboldt Park community. This unstaffed location allowed the District to offer teen basketball tournaments, was also
one of our Rollin Recreation sites and the host park for special events all summer long.

Core Value: Extra Effort
• 

Gym Show offerings were hosted all across the Region. Over 60 park showcases were held in 2018, highlighting classes,
events and programming.

 If you have ever watched a Movie in a Park, participated in creative placemaking around our 15 cultural centers, or attended
Toddler, Tunes and Turtles, you have been a part of Culture, Arts and Nature (CAN). Providing quality culture, arts and
nature programs across the city, our work brings arts and nature partners together to build community by activating parks
and natural areas. From Kidsmobile to Arts Partners in Residence, CAN envisions parks as vital spaces that encourage all
Chicagoans to explore the arts and their power to enhance quality of life, neighborhood development and community
dialogue. As part of the District’s cultural committee, we spearhead Night Out in the Parks- co-producing over 1,200 events
citywide, with 130 partners, employing over 1,500 Chicago based artists/organizations featuring events in each of Chicago's
77 Community Areas and all 50 Wards. CAN invites you to our parks to gather, reflect, learn together and play.

In its 6th year, Night Out in the Parks continued to enrich neighborhood parks and build community with over 1,200
cultural events citywide.  The Program Committee received over 230 proposals from Chicago based artists and
organizations, awarding more than 130 partners with Night Out in the Parks funding. Highlights this year included
performances from Chicago’s youth and young adult artists as we partnered with DCASE on the Year of Creative Youth,
as well as events performed in, and inspired by, the District’s natural areas.
The Arts & Culture Unit’s youth arts programs transitioned to a new mission under the banner of  Young Cultural Stewards.
Building our next generation of cultural stewards, ACU’s new program model highlights artmaking, civic action, and
cultural organizing as strategies for youth to learn about and engage with their neighborhoods, communities, and parks.
In this capacity, all of our programs—ArtSeed, Inferno, TRACE, and Young Cultural Stewards Fellows—have evolved
into stronger platforms for practicing civic engagement with Chicago youth of all ages. To make visible this impact, ACU
partnered with the Field Museum to conduct an outside evaluation on the influence of informal arts education and
published a report in Fall 2018.

Theater on the Lake, Chicago’s Summer Theater Festival, returned to its newly renovated lakefront home for the 2018
season. This year’s festival presented seven weeks of the best of Chicago’s storefront theater, and debuted the first new
play developed by a Chicago playwright through our Theater on the Lake: In the Works program, Felons and Familias,
by Sandra Delgado.  In addition to the festival, public programming including theater, music, dance, and family fun will
continue year-round at this state of the art space.
As part of our Re:Center program, in February 2018, we conducted a session on Civic Action & Cultural Organizing with
over 75 Park Advisory Council participants at the annual PAC Conference.

 The Outdoor and Environmental Education Unit (OEE, previously organized within the Department of Natural Resources)
invites people of all ages to create connections with our parks and natural areas by providing opportunities to foster
awareness, appreciation, knowledge and stewardship through programming, events, partnerships and outreach.  Our three
Nature Center locations (North Park Village Nature Center, Northerly Island, and the forthcoming Ford Calumet Environmental
Center) provide year-round programming that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  Citywide programs such as Nature Oasis
field trips, Nature Play Spaces, fishing, and gardening programs introduce our youngest participants to the wonder of the
natural world around us, while our paddling, camping, and climbing opportunities build a deeper appreciation for outdoor
and adventure recreation for Chicagoans of all ages.

Goals
Core Value: Best Deal in Town
• 

Ensure that learning and guided exploration of the natural environment remains accessible with free and low cost
opportunities for park patrons. The Harvest Garden program provides youth with lessons on the fundamentals of
organic vegetable gardening in parks across the city at no cost to participants, along with free family-friendly gardening
workshops throughout the year at the Community Roots Demonstration Garden.

Core Value: Built to Last
• 

Open the Ford Calumet Environmental Center (FCEC) in Chicago's Calumet region, establishing a gateway to naturebased education and eco-recreation for Chicago's Southeast Side and beyond. FCEC will highlight the unique natural
history and biodiversity of the area, and offer one-of-a-kind opportunities for learning and exploration. Finalize the
Unit's strategic plan to help maximize resources and explore new opportunities for programs and revenue.  

Core Value: Extra Effort
• 

Continue to encourage the activation of our Natural Areas and Nature Play Spaces by training park staff and community
members in engagement techniques and activities that focus on the natural environment and the benefits of positive,
hands-on experiences in nature. Utilize our three nature centers as resource hubs for environmental education providing
similar programing opportunities across the City.

Law

 The Department of Legislative & Community Affairs (LCA) is the central community liaison for the District. The LCA works
closely with governmental bodies and communities as well as within the District to facilitate effective working relationships.
At the state level, the LCA team manages legislative matters introduced in Springfield that impact the District. We work with
legislators, staff, state officials, the Mayor’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and the District’s contract lobbyists to see
that any legislation that affects the District is monitored. At the city level, the LCA team interacts with aldermen to address
park issues within their ward. This is accomplished by attending City Council meetings, committee meetings, and meetings
by request with aldermen. The LCA team also introduces and tracks any District projects that require City Council approval.
LCA is also responsible for working with the community to create Park Advisory Councils, known as PAC’s. This involves
organizing and attending PAC meetings, overseeing member elections, assisting in the creation of bylaws, and assisting in
fund raising efforts. The LCA team is also responsible for organizing the annual Park Advisory Council Appreciation Day, which
recognizes and rewards PAC members for their hard work and dedication to their parks. LCA is responsible for overseeing
and maintaining the Volunteer in the Parks (VIP) program, the community relations phone line, and responding to inquires
made through the park district’s web-site (Webmin). LCA also manages the DFA process and corporate volunteers. LCA also
works with each administrative department and park region to develop their federal and state agendas. LCA is represented
on the Park Enhancement Committee, which reviews and inspects requests for new park features or improvements and
submits recommendations to the General Superintendent for approval. Lastly, LCA monitors and coordinates numerous
donations and contributions from elected officials, advisory councils, and community groups.
