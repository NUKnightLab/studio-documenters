Chainnan, Committee on Finance
The Honorable Peter N. Silvestri
Chairman, Litigation Subcommittee
Re: Edward J. Egan, et al.. v. Board of Commissioners, et al., Case No. 2001-Misc. 4
As you are aware, the Special Prosecutor Verified Complaint for Declaratory Judgement and Injunctive
Relief as well as the Emergency Verified Motion for Preliminary Injunction is scheduled to be heard on
September 27, 2007 at 2:30 p.m . before presiding Judge Biebel in the criminal divisio n of the circuit court
of Cook County.
It is the strong recommendation of this office that the Board move to and vote to rescind Board
Resolution 07-R-342 adopted by poll on August 3, 2007 and ratified on September 6, 2007. T he
discontinuation of the court ordered payments is not legally defensible and the court orders should be
followed and paid as approved by the Litigation Subcommittee and the presiding Judge.

It is therefore respectfully requested that the Board Resolution 07-R-342 be rescinded by the Board of
Commissioners at the earliest possible time.
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 26, 2007 from
PETER N . SILVESTRI and JOHN P. DALEY, County Commissioners
The above referenced letter from the Office of the State's Attorney contains a recommendation to rescind
a previously approved Resolution.

SPECIAL ST A TE'S ATTORNEY AND ROBERT D. BOYLE AS
CHIEF DEPUTY SPECIAL STATE'S ATTORNEY FOR ANY AND ALL
FUTURE INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES PERTAINING TO
COMMANDER JON BURGE AND MEN UNDER HIS COMMAND
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power
and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, on April 24, 2002, the Honorable Paul Biebel, Presiding Judge of the
Criminal Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County, appointed Edward J. Egan as
Special State' s Attorney and Robert D. Boy le as Chief Deputy Special State's Attorney to
investi gate allegations that Area 2 Commander Jon Burge and Chicago Police officers
under his command had systematically tortured scores of African-American citizens at
Area 2 and 3 police headquarters; and
WH EREAS, the investigation conducted by Special Prosecutors Egan and Boyle
consumed over four years and cost the taxpayers of Cook County approximately $7
million dollars to date; and
WH EREAS, in July 2006 Egan and Boyle submitted their investigative Report to the
Cook County Board of Commissioners and concluded that although their investigation
justified seeking indictments that they were barred from doing so by the Illinois statute of
limitations; and
WH EREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners is accountable to taxpayers for
the expenditure of their funds and at the last County Board Meeting of June 5, 2007 the
County was still making court ordered payouts to the Special Prosecutors; and

of Special Prosecutors Egan and Boyle at the June 13, 2007 public hearing and in a letter
dated June I 1, 2007 Special Prosecutors Egan and Boyle declined to appear; and

supplemental report which would not lend itself to additional substantial information for
the purpose of remedying the wrongs done by Commander Burge and those working
under his command.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners discontinue any future payments after July I 0, 2007 to Special

RESOLUTION DECLARING COOK COUNTY A
"FAIR AND EQUAL COUNTY FOR IMMIGRANTS"
WH EREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to
Article VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and
WH EREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any
power and perfonn any function relating to its government and affairs including the
power to regulate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, to this end, the County of Cook is dedicated to providing all of its residents
with fair and equal access to the services, opportunities, and protection county
government has been established to administer; and
WHEREAS, there are now approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in the
United States, including half a million in Jllinois and more than 300,000 who live in
communities throughout Cook County, working full-time jobs, paying taxes, and
contributing to Social Security and Medicare; and
WHEREAS, conditioning the provision of benefits, opportumt1es, and services on
citizenship or immigrant status or inquiring about such status in the course of such
provision directly contravenes the County ' s commitment to ensuring fair and equal
access for all of its residents; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of civil immigration laws has historically been a federa l
government responsibility, a power vested first in the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and then in the Department of Homeland Security; and
WHEREAS, initiatives such as the proposed Federal Clear Law Enforcement for
Criminal Alien Removal Act, which would require local governments to give their local
Jaw enforcement agencies express authority to enforce immigration Jaws, also signals
pressure to expend limited local resources on traditionally federal functions; and
WHEREAS, encouraging local governments that are not specifically equipped or trained
to implement immigration measures is likely to result in inconsistencies and
decentralization that undem1ine instead of strengthen these measures; and

3613

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 2, 2007

WHEREAS, as a matter of public safety, the protection of an individual's citizenship
and immigrant status will engender trust and cooperation between law enforcement
officials and immigrant communities to aid in crime prevention and solving, including
human and drug trafficking, prostitution, domestic violence, and even terrorism, and will
discourage the threat of immigrant and racial profiling and harassment; and
WHEREAS, according to the National Immigration Law Center, nearly 50 cities and
counties throughout the U.S. have enacted " Sanctuary Laws", prohibiting their agencies
from inquiring about immigration status and unilaterally enforcing immigration law
provisions including Cambridge, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seattle and several states,
including Alaska, Maine and Oregon; and
WHEREAS, by means of this Resolution, Cook County joins states, cities, and counties
across the nation by declaring itself a " Fair and Equal County for Immigrants", which
means that Cook County ensures fair and equal access to essential benefits, opportunities,
and services by prohibiting Cook County bureaus, offices, departments, or employees or
other Cook County agencies or agents from inquiring or disclosing infonnation about
immigration status.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that except as provided below or when
otherwise required by law, no Cook County bureau, office, department, employee, or
other Cook County agency or agent shall condition the provision of Cook County
benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to citi zenship or immigrant status;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it shall be the policy of the Cook County Sheriffs
Office not to assist in the investigation of the citizenship or immigrant status of any
person unless such inquiry or investigation is (a) integrally related to an investigation by
the Cook County Sheriffs Office regarding a matter other than the individual's
citizenship or immigrant status, such as criminal smuggling and harboring of immigrants,
or other crimes that have as an element of the crime the illegality of a person' s presence,
or (b) as otherwise required by law. The Cook County Sheriff s Office shall not make
inquiries into immigration status for the sole purpose of detem1ining whether an
individual has violated the civil immigration laws; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by law, no Cook
County bureau, office, department, or employee or other Cook County agency or agent
shall disclose infonnation regarding the citizenship or immigrant status of any person
unless required to do so by law or such disclosure has been authorized in writing by the
individual to whom such infonnation pertains, or if such individual is a minor or is
otherwise not legally competent, by such individual's parent or guard ian; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of Health Services
("CCBH") shall not condition the provision of health benefits, opportunities, or services
on matters related to citizenship or immigrant status, but may, in the course of
detennining eligibility for benefits or seeking reimbursement from state, federal, or other
third party payers, inquire about immigrant status for the sole purpose of such a
detennination or receipt of reimbursement from said sources and, to such extent as the
disclosure of such infonnation is related to such a detennination or receipt of
reimbursement, the provisions of this Resolution and any subsequent ordinance do not
apply to the CCBH; and

3614

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 2, 2007

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by law, where
presentation of an Illinois driver's license or identification card is accepted as adequate
evidence of identity, presentation of a photo identity document issued by the person's
nation of origin, such as a driver' s license, passport, or matricula consular (consulateissued document) shall be accepted and shall not subject the person to a higher level of
scrutiny or different treatment than if the person had provided an Illinois driver's license
or identification card except that this provision does not apply to the completion of the
federally mandated 1-9 fonns provided, however, that a request for translation of such
document to English shall not be deemed a violation of any provision of this Resolution
and any subsequent ordinance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution does not create or fom1 the basis
for liability on the part of the County, its agents, or agencies. The exclusive remedy for
violation of this Resolution shall be through the County's disciplinary procedures for
officers and employees under regulations including, but not limited to, County personnel
rules, union contracts, civil service commission rules, or any other agency rules and/or
regulations. Any person alleging a violation of this Resolution shall forward a complaint
to the Cook County Office of the Inspector General (" Inspector General") who shall
process it in accordance with the complaint-processing procedures established in the
Cook County Code (Vol. I, Ch. 2, Art. IV, Div. 5, Sec. 2-285); and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that any applications, questionnaires and interview
forms used in relation to Cook County benefits, opportunities or services shall be
promptly reviewed by the pertinent agencies, and any questions requiring disclosure of
infonnation related to citizenship or immigrant status, other than those (a) pennitted by
this Resolution to require the disclosure of such information or (b) otherwise required by
law, shall be, in the best judgment of the pertinent agency, either deleted in its entirety or

the County ' s sales tax levy, that in the future, for every new recurring sources of revenue the County
receives, equaling $ 100 million, the County will abate the County portion of the sales tax by a quarter
percent until the levy is reduced to its current level of three-quarters percent (0.75%).

Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
289337

MORATORIUM ON RAISING OR IMPOSING ANY NEW TAXES FOR THE 2008
FISCAL YEAR BUDGET (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed
Resolution sponsored by Anthony J. Peraica, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, residents of Cook County are already overburdened by high taxes at the
federal, state, county and municipal levels; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government continues to waste taxpayers money on
patronage employees, many of whom do little or no work; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government wastes taxpayers money on contracts to
politically connected firms which often do poor or incomplete work; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Health Services has added to the County budget problems by
amassing millions of dollars in uncollected debt that is owed to the County; and
WHEREAS, the 2007 budget trimmed front line workers from the payroll and
eliminated many vital programs and services, while protecting political insiders; and
WHEREAS, President Stroger proceeded to hire many of his friends and relatives to
high-salaried positions while low salaried workers were being laid off; and
WHEREAS, President Stroger and his administration unilaterally modified the budget
after it was approved by this Board and redirected millions of dollars as they deemed
appropriate; and
WHEREAS, some commissioners are now proposing to shore up the budget deficit by
placing an even larger burden on Cook County taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, it is unconscionable for the Cook County Board President and members of
this Honorable Body to require taxpayers to make larger sacrifices without making
sacrifices ourselves; and
WHEREAS, the people of Cook County need visionary leadership from their County
Commissioners and County Board President as opposed to wasteful spending and everincreasing taxes and fees; and
WHEREAS, the County would have more than enough money to fund its operations if
the waste and fraud were eliminated and the revenues due the County were collected in a
timely manner.

The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

THE COOK COUNTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ACT
WHEREAS, the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) provides a means for governments
and fim1 s to enter into a voluntary, legally binding agreement to reduce their emissions of
six greenhouse gasses by 1.2 percent each year from 2006 to 201 O; and
WHEREAS, the CCX operates under a standard " cap-and-trade" system: each emitter is
allocated a certain number of credits and the number of credits is lowered each successive
year, allowing entities that reduce their emissions below their requirements to sell credits
and those that do not meet their requirements to purchase them; and
WHEREAS, many governments including the City of Chicago, King County,
Washington, and the State of Mexico as well as many Fortune 500 companies including
Ford, IBM, and DuPont have joined the CCX and committed themselves to reductions;
and

WHEREAS, Chicago reduced its direct greenhouse gas emissions by nearly nine percent
from its baseline (an average of between 1998 and 2001) and 2003, a reduction of over
30,000 tons of global warming pollution; and
WHEREAS, the City 's steps to improve energy efficiency in City buildings led to the
auditing and retrofitting of 15 million square feet of public buildings, allowing the City
and sister agencies to save $6 million annually.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Chapter 30, Article III, Division 1, Section 30-326 be enacted as
follows:
Sec. 30-326
(a)

Short title.
Thi s Ordinance shall be known as "The Cook County Climate Change
Mitigation Act."

3733

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 2, 2007

(b)

Joining the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX).
Cook County shall enter into Phase II of the CCX, committing to a
reduction of 1.2 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions each year
between 2006 and 2010.
The County will deliver energy consumption and other relevant data to
the CCX which will assist the County in creating an emissions baseline
from future reductions will be measured.
The County will develop a strategic plan within three months of the
passage of this ordinance that outlines where the County will cut
greenhouse gas emissions by the amounts required--or exceeding the
amounts required- in Phase II of CCX. This plan will be made publicly
available through the President's Web site.
As the emissions reduction plan is implemented, the County will sell any
extra emissions credits that it has on the CCX's online trading platform.

Any owner of a site which is required by the State of Illinois to have an air pollution
operating permit shall also obtain a filing pennit from the Cook County Department of
Environmental Control within 30 days of receipt of its state permit and every three years
thereafter. The owner also must pay annual emissions fees based upon the tonnage of
pollutants emitted.
This requirement does not apply to sites pennitted by the Illinois Environmental Agency
solely as ( 1) retail liquid dispensing facilities that have air pollution control equipment or
(2) agrichemical facilities with an endorsed pennit pursuant to Section 39.4 of the Illinois
Environmental Protection Act. The owner or operator of a portable emission unit, as

otherwise necessary or requested.
Notwithstanding any rules to the contrary, the owner of a permitted site shall remit to the
Cook County Department of Environmental Control the following filing pennit fees,
payable every three years upon obtaining or renewing a permit, and annual emissions
fees:
(1) A site pennitted to emit less than 25 tons per year of any combination of
regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year Annual Illinois Air Emission
Report (AER), shall pay a filing pennit fee of$ I ,000 plus an annual emissions fee of $5
per ton of the total tonnage of any combination of regulated air pollutants.
(2) A site pennitted to emit at least 25 tons per year but less than 50 tons per
year of any combination of regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year AER,
shall pay a filing permit fee of$ I ,500 plus an annual emissions fee of$ I 0 per ton of the
total tonnage of any combination of regulated air pollutants.

3737

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 2, 2007

(3) A site permitted to emit at least 50 tons but less than 100 tons per year of any
combination of regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year AER, shall pay a
filing pennit fee of $2,000 plus an annual emissions fee of $15 per ton of the total
tonnage of any combination of regulated air pollutants.
(4) A site permitted to emit at least 100 tons per year of any combination of
regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year AER, shall pay a filing permit fee
of $2,500 plus an annual emissions fee of $20 per ton of the total tonnage of any
combination of regulated air pollutants.

Section 30-396. Rules and Regulations.
(a)
The Cook County Department of Environmental Control shall establish
procedures for the collection of air pollution filing permit and annual emissions fees.
(b) The Cook County Department of Environmental Control (" Department") may deny
an application for the issuance, transfer, or renewal of an air pollution operating permit if
any air pollution site fee owed by the applicant has not been paid within 60 days of the
due date, unless the applicant, at the time of application, pays to the Department in
advance the air pollution site fee for the site that is the subject of the operating permit,
plus any other air pollution site fees then owed by the applicant. The denial of an air
pollution operating permit for failure to pay an air pollution site fee shall be subject to
review by the County Environmental Control Board of Appeals pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 30, Article II, Division 4. Section 30-123 of the Counties Code.
(c) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner
or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating
pennit, and as a result avoided the payment of pennit fees, the Department may collect
the avoided pennit fees with or without pursuing enforcement. The avoided permit fees
shall be calculated as double the amount that would have been owed had a pennit been
timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the
Cook County Environmental Management Fund
(d) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner
or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating
permit and as a result avoided the payment of permit fees, an enforcement action may be
brought. In addition to any other relief that may be obtained as part of this action, the
Cook County Department of Environmental Control may seek to recover the avoided
pennit fees. The avoided pennit fees shall be calculated as double the amount that would

threats facing this generation; and

3740

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 2, 2007

WHEREAS, reducing the em1ss10n of greenhouse gasses by improving energy efficiency and using
alternative transportation fuels lessens the strain on the power grid during times of peak use and works to
free the U.S. from dependence on foreign oil; and
WHEREAS, improvements in energy efficiency and alternative fuels pay for themselves rapidly and save
taxpayers money by accruing year after year; and

WHEREAS, mandatory emissions standards for the private sector promulgated by local governments
have the effect of creating a national patchwork of regulatory systems, an inefficient means to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions; and
WHEREAS, nearly all government entities, including Cook County, are themselves significant emitters
of greenhouse gas emissions through their electricity consumption, heating and air conditioning, vehicle
fleets, and other sources; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) provides a means for governments and firms to enter
into a voluntary, legally binding agreement to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gasses by 1.2
percent each year from 2006 to 20 l O; and
WHEREAS, the CCX operates under a standard " cap-and-trade" system: each emitter is allocated a
certain number of credits and the number of credits is lowered each successive year, allowing entities that
reduce their emissions below their requirements to sell credits and those that do not meet their
requirements to purchase them; and
WHEREAS, many governments including the City of Chicago, King County, Washington, and the State
of Mexico as well as many Fortune 500 companies including Ford, IBM, and DuPont have joined the
CCX and committed themselves to reductions; and
WHEREAS, Chicago reduced its direct greenhouse gas em1ss1ons by nearly nine percent from its
baseline (an average of between 1998 and 2001) and 2003, a reduction of over 30,000 tons of global
warming pollution; and
WHEREAS, the City's steps to improve energy efficiency in City buildings led to the auditing and
retrofitting of 15 million square feet of public buildings, allowing the City and sister agencies to save $6
million annually.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
30, Article III, Division I , Section 30-326 be enacted as follows:

Joining th e Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Cook County shall enter into Phase JI of
the CCX, committing to a reduction of H _L2_percent of its greenhouse gas emissions each year
between 2006 and 2010.
The County will deliver energy consumption and other relevant data to the CCX which will assist
the County in creating an emissions baseline from which future reductions will be measured.

3741

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 2, 2007

The County will develop a strategic plan within three months of the passage of this Ordinance
that outlines where the County will cut greenhouse gas emissions by the amounts required, or
exceeding the amounts required, in Phase JI of the CCX. This plan will be made publicly
available through the President' s Web site.
As the emissions reduction plan is implemented, the County will sell any extra emissions credits
that it has on the CCX's online trading platform.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE H-IB AND L-lB VISA FRAUD
AND ABUSE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007
WHEREAS, the federal H-JB program was created to provide companies and
universities access to foreig n workers in areas detennined to be a "specialty occupation"
by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, but, instead, has become abused by
employers as a de-facto outsourcing program; and
WHEREAS, through the H-1 B program, employers are not required to seek local talent,
thus blocking local white collar workers, including administrative and professional
positions, from competing for these job openings; and

WHEREAS, thousands of American white collar workers have been laid off and their
jobs offered to H-1 B visa holders, many in the technology sector, the backbone of the
new infonnation economy; and
WHEREAS, the Information Technology ("IT") sector has lost hundreds of thousands of
jobs since the recession of 200 1 and not only has failed to replace those jobs, but also
continues to severely under-represent women and minorities; and
WHEREAS, more than half of the IT jobs fi lled under the FY 2005 H-1 B program were
designated as entry-level white collar positions; and
WHEREAS, the H- 1B program further accelerates the race to the bottom for white collar
workers by allowing employers to offer lower wages and impose other unfair labor
practices by making the H-1 B visa holder beholden to their employer and holding the
threat of deportation over his or her head; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, between 200 I and 2005 over 180,000 white collar jobs
were put at risk, because of the H-1 B program; and

WHEREAS, Senators Dick Durbin and Charles Grassley have introduced S. 1035, the
H-1 B and L-1 B Visa Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007 to reform the H-1 B hiring
program by requiring employers to recruit from the U.S. workforce first, attest that the HI B visa holder will not displace an American worker and require that companies
advertise job openings for 30 days on the Department of Labor website before resorting
to the H-1B program.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby support S. 1035 and urges the United States Congress to pass
the measure and President Bush to sign it; and

A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE RATIFICATION OF
THE GOVERNOR'S AMEN DA TORY VETO OF HB 664 BY
THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE, SO THAT THE SECOND INSTALLMENT OF
THE 2006 TAX BILLS ARE ISSUED WITHOUT DELAY
WHEREAS, House Bill 664 was a three-year bill that would bring the Homeowner Exemption amounts
down from $40 ,000 to only $6,000 for many homeowners a move that could double or triple a
homeowners tax bill; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 2, 2007
WHEREAS, more than 40% of Chicago homeowners would have failed to qualify for any added
property tax relief under the last two years of HB 664 and would have seen significant increases in their
property tax bills; and
WHEREAS, the suburban Cook County homeowners in the North and South triennial reassessment
districts will experience similar effects to those of Chicago residents in years 2008 and 2009 as a result of
HB 664; and
WHEREAS, the Governor's amendatory veto of HB 664 gives Cook County homeowners reliable
property tax relief and increases the amount of the Homeowner Exemption to $40,000 across the board
and makes the exemption permanent; and
WHEREAS, there has been much misinfonnation stating that increasing the exemption to $40,000 would
only help affluent communities or more expensive homes; and
WHEREAS, the amended legislation would actually benefit homeowners on Chicago's South and West
sides the most where these residents would see a larger percentage of savings on their tax bills then
homeowners in other parts of the city; and
WHEREAS, under both proposals about one-third of all downtown buildings will still pay less m
property taxes than they did last year; and
WHEREAS, home values have been increasing at a faster pace than commercial properties making
residential properties shoulder the burden of higher property taxes and the 7% Expanded Homeowner
Exemption helps to slow the shift that has been occurring; and
WHEREAS, in 1997 residential property owners paid 35% of all the property taxes paid in the City of
Chicago and today pay over 50% of all property taxes; and
WHEREAS, the renewal of the expiring 2004 enabling legislation for this program was first addressed
with the leadership in Springfield in 2005 with the hopes of addressing this important tax relief matter in
a timely fash ion and preventing any significant delays in the issuance of tax bill s; and
WHEREAS, it is important that these unresolved issues be dealt with immediately by the leadership in
Springfield so that tax bills can be issued and local taxing bodies and school districts get their necessary
funds; and
WHEREAS, the Governor, the Illinois Senate, the Chicago City Council and the various Cook County
suburban Mayor's organizations have joined this body in recognizing the need for meaningful property
tax refonn for our shared constituents.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by this body, that the immediate ratification of the
governor' s amendatory veto of HB 664 by the Illinois legislature is strongly requested by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners so that 2nd Installment 2006 Tax Bills are issued without further delay
and with the significant tax relief provided by the amendatory veto; and
