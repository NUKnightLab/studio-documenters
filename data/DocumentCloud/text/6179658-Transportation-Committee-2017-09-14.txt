1. The committee discussed the Milwaukee Ave pilot project
a. SL does not like the upgrades, thinks that it has made it too congested and hard to get
through Milwaukee Ave.
b. The committee discussed the slip lane closure
c. SL- cars aren’t being considered, JH- cars are the only thing that have been considered
for a long time.  there is an attempt to balance all users.
d. Loading is a huge problem
e. The taxi stand has been moved but the taxis seem to be unaware and are still lining up
at the Triangle.
f. Planters- the staff has had a set back with the permit process and is very frustrated. We
will carry over the funding until 2018 and put the planters out in the spring, there is not
enough time left in 2017. Staff will research different planters, that are bigger and look
better with a new goal of having custom planters fabricated and installed in the Spring.
2. The fence on North Ave at Wolcott (?) has been damaged, staff will get a cost for repair from
Why Not Iron and will bring to the Commission for approval.
3. The bike corrals have been installed
4. Staff will check on the bench permits and find more locations
5. Blue Lounge Project- we are unable to permit the program as we have planned to execute it.
We need to rethink and come up with another solution. JW sill check back in with Cleanslate
and try to find another way.
