Re: Retirement Risk / Reciprocity
Ms. Lopez stated that, with regard to reciprocity, the Pension Board indicated that each fund pays their own; if an
employee has 30 years of service, and 1/3 is with the County and 2/3 is with the City, the County is liable for 1/3
and the City is liable for 2/3. The employee would be required to apply to both entities for their retirement
benefits. Board Chairman Hammock asked Ms. Lopez to inquire further regarding how CCHHS can better
estimate the risk of retirement of its employees; this involves adding the County Pension Board’s data regarding
years of service for CCHHS employees to any other applicable years of service accrued through reciprocity.
