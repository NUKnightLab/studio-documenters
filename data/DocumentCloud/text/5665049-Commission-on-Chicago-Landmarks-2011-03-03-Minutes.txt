 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
March 3, 2011
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on February 3, 2011, at 1:50 p.m. The meeting was
held at 33 N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
Phyllis Ellin
Ed Torrez
Ernest Wong (arrived at 2:05 p.m.)

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cynthia Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

209 S. LaSalle
(Rookery Building – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed architectural accent lighting on the west and north (street)
facades

Action:

Approved unanimously (vote 3-0, Commissioner Wong not yet present)
with the following conditions:
1. As shown on the schematic attachment details, the luminaires are to be
attached to mounting devices secured to the window frames, with no
attachments through the masonry. Final luminaire mounting details
shall take into account any potential water retention issues, and the
mounting devices and any conduit shall be of a non-corrosive material
and finish/painted a color to match the color of the masonry ledges.
Final attachment details shall be submitted for Historic Preservation
staff review and approval with the permit application; and,
2. To minimize any potential visibility of the luminaires from the public
rights-of-way, the luminaires should be installed as close as possible to
the windows, and in no instance closer to the outer edge of the
masonry ledges than shown on the line-of-sight diagram, dated
January 21, 2011.

 2.

30 W. Monroe
(Inland Steel Building – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new building standard for replacement of office-floor ceilings,
which includes increasing the setback of the existing soffit

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed new typical office ceiling plan (dated 01/12/11), with a
proposed increase of the setback of the perimeter ceiling soffit from 43/4” to 1’-3¾”, is approved as submitted. The replacement 12”x 12”
Armstrong Ultima custom white ceiling tiles and the light fixture
housings to be retained, proposed to be retrofitted with a new 5’-long
T8 lamp and acrylic lens, are also approved. The retrofitted light
fixtures closest to the east and west perimeter walls may be reduced in
length to accommodate the increased setback of the soffit. Should the
applicant decide not to retrofit the light fixtures, new custom light
fixtures of the same dimensions, visual appearance, light/lamp
qualities, finish, and location may be installed subject to the prior
review and approval of Historic Preservation staff. Fixture cut sheets
and tile, lamp, and lens specifications shall be included in the permit
plans;
2. The proposed area for tenant-specific ceilings and light fixtures, set
back fifteen feet from the perimeter walls (as denoted by the plan
dated 01/26/11) is approved, as these areas at the typical office floor
are minimally visible from the surrounding streets and will allow
tenant flexibility; and,
3. Building Standard: For all future tenant build-outs, future ceiling
replacement projects shall match the approved scope of work, product
specifications, etc., and address all conditions of approval, to maintain
a consistent historic visual character for the building.

3.

1027 W. Madison Building
(Potential Class L application for the C.C.P. Holden Building – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation of an existing 4-story
masonry commercial building, including masonry repair, new groundfloor storefronts, a new cornice, new windows, a 50% green roof, and a
new roof-top deck.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Façade Design:
1. Once the EIFS cladding is removed in its entirety from the base of the
building, Historic Preservation staff shall be notified in order to
conduct a site visit to confirm existence of any remaining historic

 fabric to be repaired or replaced to match, or, if any physical scarring
exists, to inform the design of the ground floor. The proposed groundfloor configuration shall be revised to be consistent with such
uncovered physical evidence, if any. The final ground-floor storefront
design shall be subject to Historic Preservation staff review and
approval;
2. A new brick mold shall be incorporated as part of the new windows,
with a profile to match the original brick molds located on the rear
façade windows. Existing and proposed details shall be submitted
with the permit plans;
3. The proposed use of high-density cellular PVC, in this limited
application, is approved as proposed for the replacement of the
missing cornice on the front of the building;
Roof-top Work:
4. The roof-top deck, proposed to be setback (per roof plan dated
01/19/11) with a railing 2’-4” above the top of the new cornice, will
not be visible from the surrounding streets and is approved as
proposed;
5. The new front (north) stair tower shall be modified so that the roof of
the enclosure can slope down towards the front, and reduce its
visibility from the public way. (As such, the direction of the stair will
need to be revised);
More Information:
6. Existing sandstone masonry shall be retained and repaired as much as
possible. Where replacement is required, the applicant shall make best
efforts to find replacement sandstone to match the historic in size,
color, and texture, and report such information to Historic Preservation
staff. If unsuccessful, and in consultation with staff, alternate stone
products, stained stone, or integral-colored glass-fiber-reinforced
concrete may be considered for possible use as a substitute material
subject to Historic Preservation staff review and approval, and
provided that the material and finish are durable, with UV resistance,
and can match the sandstone in size, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Samples of the stone patching, replacement stone, masonry,
and mortar shall be reviewed and approved by staff prior to order,
fabrication, and installation;
7. The stone façade should be cleaned with the gentlest means possible.
Any chemical cleaning product, cleaning specifications, and material
safety data sheets shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff;
8. Enlarged dimensioned section and plan details of the new cornice,
clad-wood storefront system, clad-wood and stone piers, and windows
shall be included in the permit plans. Samples of the granite for the

 knee wall and finish colors of the storefront, windows, and cornice
shall be reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to
order and installation;
9. Any exterior light fixtures and signs shall be reviewed and approved
by Historic Preservation staff prior to order and installation; and,
10. A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing the proposed roof
work and new interior wall and floor openings, relative to how the
building should be braced and protected during construction, shall be
submitted for Historic Preservation staff review and approval, as part
of the permit plans. The recommended measures, sequencing, and
protections shall be incorporated in the structural and architectural
drawings.

6307 N. Louise
(Old Edgebrook District – 41st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed exterior alterations to an existing 2-story, masonry-and-frame
single-family residence, including the removal of a bay window,
alterations to masonry openings and a roof dormer, and replacement of all
windows

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The bay window on the side (east) façade, proposed to be removed,
appears to be an original or an early change to the house within the
period of significance of the district, and is also similar to the bay
windows on the front elevation. The bay window appears to be an
historic feature of the building and should therefore be retained. The
glass of the bay windows may, however, be replaced with an opaque
glass, such as spandrel glass or frit glass, or modified with a film or
other treatment to obscure interior changes to the building. [Several
alternative ideas were suggested at the meeting that would retain the
bay while accommodating the proposed interior modifications.
Historic Preservation staff is available to discuss them with you
further.] Additional information, details, and/or material sample or
specifications shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for
review and approval prior to order and installation;
2. Fiber cement siding may be installed on the dormers and the rear
façade, as proposed, provided that the siding shall match the size,
profile and lap exposure of the historic wood siding and shall have a
smooth finish. New cladding on the gable-end of the front elevation,
however, shall be wood siding to match historic size, profile and lap
exposure;
3. Details of existing and proposed siding, vertical dividers, windows,
including brick molds, shall be submitted with the permit application
to ensure that the new exterior cladding and trim details match the

 design, dimensions and appearance of the existing features;
4. Samples of the new brick shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff prior to order and installation. The new brick and
mortar shall match the historic masonry (unpainted) in color, size, joint
profile, and texture. The mortar and paint specifications for a
breathable masonry coating shall be submitted to Historic Preservation
staff for review and approval; and,
5. As proposed, the scope of the project includes the removal of the
interior walls of the historic building, while the exterior walls and the
roof would remain in place. A report and drawings by a licensed
structural engineer addressing how the historic building will be
supported, braced and protected during the demolition and
construction shall be submitted with the permit plans. The
recommended measures, sequencing and protections shall be
incorporated in the structural and architectural drawings.
5.

1601 N. Milwaukee
(Milwaukee Avenue District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed rehabilitation and conversion to a retail use of a 3-story
limestone bank building, including masonry repair and repainting,
enlargement of ground-floor window openings, window replacement, and
new retail tenant signs.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The fourteen ground-floor window openings, proposed to be enlarged,
are original character-defining features on primary (street) elevations
of the building, and the size of the openings shall not be changed.
However, given that the existing windows are not historic, and in
furtherance of the intended retail use of the building, the replacement
ground-floor windows need not match the original configuration but
may be undivided picture windows with minimal framing designed to
maximize the amount of glazing areas;
2. As proposed, all new replacement glass shall be clear glass. Existing
and proposed dimensioned window and door details, and their
proposed finishes, shall be included in the permit plans;
3. The fixture plan shall be further studied. Areas behind the windows
should be kept open and unobstructed to allow transparency and views
into the building. Additional information about the build-out behind
the windows, any proposed window signage, and merchandising
installations shall be provided for Historic Preservation staff review
and approval as part of the permit application;
4. Masonry cleaning, repair, and replacement details shall be included in
the permit application plans. Samples of any replacement stone,
patching, and mortar shall be reviewed and approved by Historic

 5.

7.

8.

Preservation staff prior to order and installation. Any new limestone
shall match the unpainted limestone in color, texture, and finish; and
any new mortar shall match the historic unpainted condition in color,
profile, and composition;
A conditions analysis of the paint and stone shall be performed by a
qualified materials engineer/conservator to determine the appropriate
paint product type, color, and finish for the existing painted limestone.
The analysis and paint specification shall be submitted for review and
approval by Historic Preservation staff prior to order and application;
As proposed, no exterior light fixtures shall be mounted to the stone
facades;
The location, size, design, and attachment details for the large “W”
sign shall be further studied so as not to obscure character-defining
features such as windows and to ensure that it will not adversely affect
the building or the district. [A possible location is the wall area below
the proposed window location.] The four signs proposed above the
doors should be relocated to the flat stone jambs above the door and
below the beaded stone molding, or could be relocated to the flat stone
pilasters next to the doors and designed to appear like plaques. The
other proposed sign areas, the two locations along the stone sign bands
at the parapet and the proposed projecting banners mounted at the
stone pilasters are approved in concept only. A rendering showing all
proposed signage shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff as
part of the continued review. All future signage including material,
color, attachment details, sizes, lighting and other information shall be
reviewed and approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order
and installation. The signs shall be designed with as few attachments
to the masonry as possible, and with attachments preferably located at
the mortar joints; and,
The proposed use of the building requires a zoning change for the
portion of the lot which is currently zoned M1-2. The Commission
takes no position regarding the merits of any requested zoning change.
