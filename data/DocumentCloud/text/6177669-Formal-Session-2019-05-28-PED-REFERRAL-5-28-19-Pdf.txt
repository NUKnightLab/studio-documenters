HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: 2019-2O Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Neighborhood Opportunity
Fund (NOF) Homeless Public Service Deliberations

Your Honorable Body has previously taken action on the 2019-20 CDBG budget, which set
aside $2,475,417 for Homeless Public Service activities. A copy of the Schedule A which was
prepared by the Housing and Revitalization Department, then reviewed and revised by the City
Planning Commission staff and ultimately approved by Your Honorable Body is attached for
your reference.

In June of 201 8 Your Honorable Body authorized the shifting of the timeline for the HPS RFP to
coincide with the Emergency Shelter Grants awards.

On Monday, May 20, 2019 the RF went live and will remain open for 35 ?ve days. Two
informational sessions to address questions regarding the RFP were held on May 21St and 
All proposals are due June 24, 2019. In late June and early July the submitted proposals will be
jointed viewed and scored by HRD, CPC staff, OCP and OGM, as was done during the NOF
Public Service process. It is anticipated that Your Honorable Body will be asked to vote on the
awards at the top of July.

The attached resolution seeks to set the time and manner by which Your Honorable Body will
deliberate on the Homeless Public Service proposals.

Please let us know if you have any questions regarding the meeting schedule or the CDBG
program.

Respectfully submitted,

Marcell R. Todd, Jr., Director
