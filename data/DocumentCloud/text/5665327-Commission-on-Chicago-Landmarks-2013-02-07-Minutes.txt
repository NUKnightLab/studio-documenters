Present:

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1725 N. Hudson
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Continued Review: Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation
including new rear 3rd floor addition to existing 2-story residential
building and new masonry garage.

Action:

The Committee unanimously found that the proposed project does not
meet the Commission’s Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings
and New Construction, and Standards 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10 of the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic
Buildings and therefore, the project would have an adverse effect on the
significant historical and architectural features of the landmark property
and district.
The Committee also unanimously found that, with the following
conditions, the project would meet the Commission’s Guidelines for
Alterations to Historic Buildings and New Construction, and Standards 2,
5, 6, 9, and 10 of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings and therefore, the revised project
would not have an adverse effect on the significant historical and
architectural features of the landmark property and district:
1. The project shall be modified to reduce the height of the rear
addition to be no taller than the existing historic building;

 2. The drawings shall be revised to show that the existing nonhistoric siding shall be removed and Historic Preservation staff
shall inspect and confirm whether any historic wood clapboard
siding remains or if any scarring exists indicating the original
siding and trim type and profile. If historic siding does exist, it
shall remain and be repaired, wherever possible. Areas beyond
repair may be replaced with new wood siding to match the historic
siding in size, type and profile. Historic Preservation staff shall
review the condition of the siding prior to any work beginning and
shall approve any areas of replacement and the replacement siding.
The fiber-cement substrate siding, as submitted, may be used as a
substitute cladding material on an elevation-by-elevation basis
where the building code requires non-combustible siding. The
siding shall have a smooth finish and otherwise match the existing
wood siding in size, profile, and finish. Details and material
samples of the existing and proposed siding shall be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff;
3. Paint removal specifications and product information shall be
submitted with the permit application;
4. Window and wood trim details showing exterior profiles and
dimensions shall be submitted with the permit application;
5. The drawings shall be modified to incorporate masonry detailing at
the east elevation (Fern Court) of the garage parapet wall to break
up the blank mass of the brick wall and to show garage doors of a
design more compatible with the historic character of the district
(such as paneled doors); and,
6. The project requires a zoning variation and/or adjustment, and the
Commission takes no position regarding any requested
variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code requirements.
The Committee advised the applicant that should the Historic Preservation
staff receive a permit application for the project as currently proposed,
staff shall issue a preliminary disapproval of the application. A
preliminary disapproval of the application would trigger an informal
conference and, if the informal conference does not reach an accord, a
public hearing on the permit application would be scheduled in accordance
with the provisions of the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance.
2.

227-229 W. Menomonee
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation including raising the existing
frame building by 4.5’ on a new basement, installation of new siding,
windows, front door, front stair/stoop, and construction of a new rear
addition.

 Action:

The Committee found (3-1 vote, with Commissioner Houlihan against)
that the proposed project to raise the historic cottage by 4.5’ from grade
did not meet the Commission’s Guidelines for Alterations to Historic
Buildings and New Construction, and Standards 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10 of the
U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic
Buildings and therefore, the project would have an adverse effect on the
significant historical and architectural features of the landmark property
and district.
The Committee also found (3-1 vote, with Commissioner Houlihan
against) that, with the following conditions, the project would meet the
Commission’s Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings and New
Construction, and Standards 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 of the U.S. Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings and
therefore, the revised project would not have an adverse effect on the
significant historical and architectural features of the landmark district:
1. The project shall be modified to eliminate the front stairs and limit
the structure to be raised by a maximum of 1’-0” from grade to
accommodate the construction of a new foundation;
2. As part of the permit application, a survey of the existing floor and
roof heights of the building shall be submitted. Upon completion
of the foundation construction, another survey of shall be
submitted indicating the height of the top of the foundation from
grade. And upon completion of the project, another survey shall
be submitted indicating the final floor and roof heights of the
building. The surveys shall be stamped by licensed surveyors and
submitted to Historic Preservation Staff for review and approval;
3. A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing the proposed
foundation replacement and structural modifications, relative to
how the building should be braced and protected during
construction, shall be submitted for Historic Preservation staff
review and approval, as part of the permit plans. The
recommended measures, sequencing, and protections shall be
incorporated in the structural and architectural drawings;
4. The existing non-historic siding shall be removed and Historic
Preservation staff shall inspect the condition of the historic wood
clapboard siding and to confirm if any scarring exists indicating
any original features. The historic wood siding shall remain and be
repaired, wherever possible. Areas beyond repair may be replaced
with new wood siding to match the historic siding in size, type and
profile. Historic Preservation staff shall review the condition of
the siding prior to any work beginning and shall approve any areas
of replacement and the replacement siding;

 5. New double-hung clad-wood windows and front door shall be
installed to match the original in location, shape, and size.
Enlarged dimensioned window and door details and trim surrounds
shall be submitted with the permit application;
6. Enlarged dimensioned details for the new wood cornice shall be
submitted with the permit application;
7. The height of the rear addition shall be modified to match the
massing of the front house, or may be smaller than the massing of
the front house; and,
8. The project as proposed would require a zoning variation and/or
adjustment, and the Commission takes no position regarding any
requested variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code
requirements.
The Committee advised the applicant that should the Historic Preservation
staff receive a permit application for the project as currently proposed,
staff shall issue a preliminary disapproval of the application. A
preliminary disapproval of the application would trigger an informal
conference and, if the informal conference does not reach an accord, a
public hearing on the permit application would be scheduled in accordance
