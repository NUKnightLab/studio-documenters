The amount of CDBG funds requested was over $21 million. The amount of CDBG funds available for
programming is based on 2011 Program Year allocation estimates totaling $9,405,620.00. The proposed

However, the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) has advised Grantees to assume
funding based on the 2010 allocation of $435,001.00. The proposed use of ESG funds is to provide
essential services, and maintenance/operations costs for homeless shelters in suburban Cook County, as
well as funding for homeless prevention.
The amount of HOME Investment Partnerships funds granted by HUD for the 2011 Program Year
allocation is estimated at $5,524,208.00. Applications for eligible HOME projects are accepted
throughout the year. The proposed use of all funds must be incorporated into the County’s Annual Action

Prior to submitting required documents to HUD, Cook County must also publish recommended project
