Emerging Manager – Portfolio Review;
Ms. Hackett and Mr. Vinzons reviewed the Fund’s 2013 year-to-date emerging manager
utilization, performance and MWBE broker-dealer usage. Through June 2013, the Fund’s
emerging manager exposure represented approximately 17% of the total assets, or $1.3
billion. From a performance standpoint, 82% of the Fund’s emerging manager mandates are
generating positive returns. Specifically, mid to small cap managers have outperformed their
large cap counterparts in domestic equity on a relative basis. Within international equity,
managers with lower exposure to emerging markets have fared better due to the recent
anticipation of Fed stimulus tapering. Finally, the Fund’s MWBE broker-dealer utilization is
at or above targets in all asset classes.
