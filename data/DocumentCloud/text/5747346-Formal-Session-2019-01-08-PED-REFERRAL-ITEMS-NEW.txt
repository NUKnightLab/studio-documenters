RE: HUD Section 108 Loan Guarantee Assistance Program
Request to Refinance Six (6) Existing Notes

Honorable City Council:

The Housing and Revitalization Department coordinates several loans the City of Detroit
(?City?) has taken out in prior years with the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development under the HUD Section 108 Loan Guarantee Assistance Program (?Section
108 Program?). The City repays the principal and interest owed to HUD pursuant to the Notes
from the annual allocation of Community Development Block Grant funds received by

the City.

HUD has approached the City with an Opportunity to re?nance the following six (6) notes issued
by HUD under the Section 108 Program (the ?Notes?):

 

 

Note Series Original Principal Remaining Principal Project

An_lount Borrowed Amount Owed
B-02-MC-26-0006 2006-A $7,789,000.00 $1,568,000.00 Mexicantown
B-03-MC-26-0006 2006-A $2,058,000.00 $1,658,000.00 East Forest Arts
B-03-MC-26-0006 2008-A $6,522,000.00 $5,072,000.00 GREP
B-OS-MC-26-0006 2008-A $7,050,000.00 $2,750,000.00 Woodward Gardens I
B-OS-MC-26-0006-A 2008-A $10,700,000.00 $4,471,000.00 Book Cadillac [1
B-05-MC-26-0006-B 2008-A $18,700,000.00 $12,500,000.00 Fort Shelby

The proposed re?nancing of the Notes would decrease loan repayment terms by approximately 2
percentage points that will save the City roughly $2,000,000.00 in CDBG funds over the remaining
term of the original Notes. Such CDBG savings can then be utilized by the City for other purposes.

This Opportunity was brought to the City?s attention in mid?December 2018 with a ?nal deadline
for the City to approve and execute requisite documents for re?nance of the Notes by mid-January
2019. In furtherance Of saving future CDBG funding, we respectfully request that your Honorable
Body adopt the attached resolution that approves re?nance of the Notes.

amendments, notes, loan documents and other instruments required by HUD to effectuate
