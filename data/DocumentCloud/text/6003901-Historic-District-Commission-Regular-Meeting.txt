STAFF REPORT 5-8-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6174
ADDRESS: 2215 W. BOSTON BLVD.
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BOSTON EDISON
APPLICANT: JOHN CLARK – AT HOME BUILDERS
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 05-02-2019

PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY

PROPOSAL
The building located at 2215 West Boston Boulevard is an eclectic Tudor-Style, English Revival home
built in 1914. It sits on the southwest corner of West Boston Boulevard and 14th Street. The home features
a front facing, cross gabled roof. A gabled front porch with a Tudor arch leads to the front door. The brick
façade features several character-defining architectural elements: A steeply pitched slate roof, a massive
chimney crowned with chimney pots as well as ornamental half-timbering around the second story bay
window on the front elevation and at the secondary gables.
The home originally had a garage on in the rear yard, bordering the alley that was accessible through the
front of the yard. The applicant was unable to provide information on the original garage. Using of Google
Street View, it appears there was a garage with ornamental timbering at this location in 2013, while the
next available view in 2016 shows the garage in a ruined state. Currently, there is a concrete slab at
the location which appears to be of recent construction. The contractor states that the slab was poured
prior to his involvement with the project and estimates the age to be between 2-3 years old.
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to complete the following
work associated with the overall rehabilitation of the building as per the attached drawings:
•

The erection of a new 22’ x 20’ garage at the location of the existing slab with the following
features:
o The walls of the garage will be 8’ ht.
 Staff estimates total height at peak of roof to approx. 13.5’
o Two-car garage with (2) insulated garage doors in white [9’x7’]
o (1) steel 6-panel exterior door on the side [36”]
o Textured fiber cement lap siding by Allura [5/16” x 7-1/4”]
 Trim and siding to be painted the same color as the house
o The roof will be covered in Architectural shingle in “colonial slate” color
 The roof will feature 1’ overhangs at the gable and the eaves
 Roof pitch: 6/12

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(7)

Relationship of materials. The majority of houses are faced with brick, while many are partially or
totally stucco. There are some stone buildings, sometimes combined with stucco; clapboard is rare, and
is extremely rare as the sole material. Roofing includes slate, tile and asphalt shingles. Wood shingle
roofs were once common and have generally been replaced with asphalt. Wood shake does not exist
and there is no known evidence that it was ever used in the district. Stone trim is common. Wood is
almost universally used for window frames and other functional trim and is used in many examples for

 REPORT

all trim.
(8)

(9)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of a low-relief
pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted with the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. There are a
few houses with rough or rusticated stone surfaces. The use of stucco or concrete, with or without halftimbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces, is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have
particular textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles generally have little textural interest, even
in those types which purport to imitate some other variety.
Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (such as red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall
surfaces. Natural stone colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its
natural state, or is painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, natural
and stained wood colors), and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range.
Paint colors often relate to style. The buildings derived from classical precedents, particularly those of
neo-georgian style, generally have woodwork painted white, cream, or in the range of those colors
including "putty"; doors and shutters are frequently dark green or black. Colors known to have been in
use on similar buildings of this style in the eighteenth or early twentieth centuries may be considered for
appropriateness. Buildings of medieval inspiration (notably neo-tudor) generally have painted
woodwork and window frames of a dark brown or cream color. Half timbering is almost always stained
dark brown. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always
acceptable for a house, and may provide guidance for similar houses.

(10)

Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style. Neo-georgian
buildings display classic details, mostly in wood, and sometimes in stone. Porches, shutters, window
frames, cornices, and dormer windows are commonly, although not always, treated. Details on
"mediterranean" style or vernacular buildings including arched windows, door openings, and porches,
are often done in stone, brick, tile, and sometimes in stucco. Buildings of medieval inspiration tend to
have details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornaments on window frames, door frames, and
eaves. In general, the various styles are rich in architectural details.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exist in the district, depending on building style.
Shallow hipped roofs with dormers, roofs with triangular gables, and steep hipped roofs predominate. A
few gambrel roofs exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or the hipped types, with subsidiary
or transverse roofs, are not unusual. Dormers are common. Flat roofs are present only as subsidiary
roofs on residential structures. Garage roofs generally reflect the style and pitch of the roof on the main
house.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Most of the houses in the district have front entrances which are oriented
toward the streets running east-west. The houses on Lasalle Boulevard, from Chicago Boulevard to
Edison Boulevard, are orientated toward Lasalle. Garages are frequently oriented either toward an alley
and/or the front drive or toward a side street in the case of corner lots. Almost all garages are detached
and are at the rear of the lot.

RECOMMENDATION
The original garage seems to have been demolished in 2016, it is unclear to staff whether this was an intentional
demolition, the result of damage from nearby trees, or neglect. The proposed garage will be placed in the original
location of the previous garage, to the rear of the home. While the current property owner has recently installed a
fence along the perimeter of the property, the front façade of the garage will still be visible from the primary rightof-way. Therefore staff recommends the white garage doors be painted to match the brown tones of the residence. It

 REPORT

is staff’s reccomendation that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work based on
the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number 10) New additions, exterior alterations, or
related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
… with the condition that the white garage doors and man-door be painted to match the brown tones of the
residence.
Motion DRAFT

•

I move that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work items
proposed in application number 19-6174 because the work as described does meet the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number 10) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new
construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural
features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
