was committed to making positive changes in the region. He was an organizer for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and worked at Maryville Academy, a home for troubled youth, as a
resident adviser and counselor; and
WHEREAS, Judge Burrell was an effective and pragmatic problem solver. He never forgot the challenges of
growing up in a community that routinely forces its young people to confront lethal danger. He crafted the “Safe
Neighborhoods Action Plan” a comprehensive violence prevention plan to fight back to against Chicago’s youth
homicide crisis; and
WHEREAS, Judge Burrell fought a valiant battle against cancer. And, in much the same way as he had taken the
lessons from his childhood on the west side to help the children who came after him, Judge Burrell found a way to
assist others who battled with cancer. He was an advisory member of the Brad’s Kid’s Pediatric Cancer
Foundation, a charity focusing on children with cancer; and

The Chief Procurement Officer Concurs
Summary: In 2013, Cook County issued an RFP for Information Security, Compliance and Incident Response
services, which resulted in the contract that BOT now seeks authorization for the CPO to execute. Procuring the
services of information security experts is a critical step to improving the County’s information security practices,
achieving compliance with applicable information security regulations and best practices, and properly handling
information security incidents.
Cook County provides services for approximately 5.3 million residents. Many of these services handle sensitive
information including social security numbers, credit card numbers, and personal health information. With the
assistance of information security consulting experts, the County can enhance its information security program by
performing nationally recognized risk assessments, enhancing the County’s information security framework,
performing additional cyber security monitoring and testing, and improving its incident response and forensic
response capabilities. In addition to the objectives identified above, other desired outcomes include the
protection personal information of County residents and the mitigation of cyber-security risks.

copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Amended Class 6a
eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date
an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Amended Class 6a. If the Ordinance
or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at
that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that an
Ordinance or Resolution supporting the incentive has been requested.
c. A copy of the Ordinance or Resolution or letter confirming that an Ordinance or Resolution has
been requested, whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office
to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the
affected districts.
d. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose
of the Amended Class 6a, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant
must present the municipal-enabling Ordinance or Resolution obtained in accordance with Section
b to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended
Class 6a and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of the County Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended
Class 6a need not be filed at the time of filing the Amended Class 6a application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request
the class change to Amended Class 6a.
e. The Assessor shall provide rules for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Amended Class
6a incentives granted as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the
Amended Class 6a site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the retail
center with grocery store component or the retail development enterprise continues its operations
at that location. In addition, recipients of Amended Class 6a incentives shall be required to report
to the Assessor within 30 days if the retail center with grocery store component or the retail
development enterprise ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be
forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the
time established by the Assessor’s rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the nonfiling. Additionally, if the retail center with grocery store component or the retail
development enterprise ceases operations at that location, then the Amended Class 6a incentive
granted shall terminate.
f. Class 6a applications for newly constructed of substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new
construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6a incentive.
g. This classification will begin from date of the notice of approval regarding the retail center with
grocery store component or from the date of such new construction (excluding demolition, if any)
regarding the retail development enterprise and will continue for a period of 12 years or until the
retail center with grocery store component or the retail development enterprise ceases operations
at that location if that occurs sooner.

h. This incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent
assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
i. The property can continue to be deemed “qualified” for the purposes of the Class 6a;
ii. The applicant notifies the Assessor’s Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive
from the municipality or the County Board, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area;
iii. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the premise
continues to be deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a, and supports
and consents to renewal of the Amended Class 6a; and
iv. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Assessor’s Office before the expiration of the ten percent assessment level period.
i. The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and the
property continues to be deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a.
j. A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office
to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the

k. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next 2 years, pursuant to
Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.
l. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Amended Class
6a.
(7)(8) Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed
buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property,
including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square
footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as
the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on
the parcel.
a.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application
to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution
is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a

Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.
b.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

c.

Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new
construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to
abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior to the
commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

d.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b,
unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling
Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide
a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such
a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the
time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b.
If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall
instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming
that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance where
real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if
there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification
of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is
that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect
shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required

finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist,
as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the
Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a minimum
of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to
continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused; and

3.

The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same
property.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special circumstances, and
a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial
enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be in
imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a
municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property
is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of
special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a
certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment
appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the
County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special
circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be received
by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b incentives
granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its
operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER
Program shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy
of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports
within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the nonfiling. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive granted
pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the
case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification shall continue for a period
of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the
premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this incentive may
be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent assessment level pursuant to
section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive from the
municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
6b; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's
Office before the expiration of the ten-percent assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are not
renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as
the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 6b
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the
period relating to the nonfiling.

(8)(9) Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including abandoned
property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such property is situated; or vacant
land; where such real estate because of contamination has undergone environmental testing and
remediation and has received a "No Further Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further Remediation
Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the industrial or commercial
use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having previously
owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or being associated through
a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or operated the site, which ownership
or operation caused the contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation. A
present owner who can successfully demonstrate that the owner was not responsible for the
contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class C is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class C application
to the Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution must be filed at the time of application
for the Class C classification. A copy of that ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted, will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of
the County Board from the affected districts.

d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be made
within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter." Where an application for Class
C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon
which remediation has been completed, the one year limitation will be waived for any subsequent
separate application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional portions of the
property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs, including site
investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring, and engineering and
legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively,
must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's
property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial and
commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a
property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are met:

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
C; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the
adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this
renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the effected districts.

g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level is
higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment
is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no
renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section
74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert
to the applicable classification under this division.

h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine eligibility for
the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to
ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under the Class C classification.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class C
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class C site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(9)(10) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified commercial
development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need of commercial
development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting
of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or
abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is situated;
or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation
has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the

rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible
for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the
total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a. The finding
of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7a application. Not withstanding the
foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed
"abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and a resolution to that
effect shall be included with the Class 7a eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy. After such 12-year
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7a
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7a site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(10)(11) Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this division, comprising
a qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an
"area in need of commercial development", where total development costs, exclusive of land, exceed
$2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon
which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent
such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land
qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The
amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the
rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b. The
finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7b application. Not
withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a
property is deemed "abandoned" where:

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b and a resolution to that
effect shall be included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7b
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7b site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(11)(12) Class 8. Real estate used primarily for industrial and commercial purposes, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned
property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has
added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

b.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square
footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the
parcel. Such real estate must be either obtained through the Cook County Tax Reactivation Project
or must be located in one of the following designated geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in accordance with the
provisions of Section 74-65(b);

2.

An enterprise community as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or
the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, and the municipality in which such real estate is
located, or, if in an unincorporated area, the County must by lawful Resolution determine that
such real estate is consistent with an overall plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or

3.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom; Bremen; Calumet; Rich; and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to
Class 8. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead
file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before
November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

d.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or
in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval.

Unless it was granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, this incentive may be renewed during the
last year a property is entitled to a ten-percent assessment level pursuant to 74-64(11), if the following
requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial or commercial use of the

of the Class 8; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's
Office before the expiration of the 10 percent assessment level period.

f.

Class 8 incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program are not renewable. For all other
Class 8 incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to

the appropriate local governing body within the period from one year to six months prior to the
expiration of the initial five-year period.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 8
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 8 site. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the
period relating to the nonfiling.

When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is terminated by action of the owner or the
Assessor, the property owner shall, in a manner and form determined by the Assessor, notify all Class
9 tenants of the date of the termination of Class 9 classification. Once the Class 9 classification is
terminated, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

(13)(14) Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division, consisting of land
and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract renewal. The
portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number of
Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied only to property used
for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed pursuant
to one of the following alternatives:
1.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market option, after
finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an inspection by
HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property is decent, safe,
sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS) violations;

ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot be
eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the
use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase the rents to the use
restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and

iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable market
rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under the mark
up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property meets at least
one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance difficult
to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a contribution
of state or local funds to the property.
3.

b.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation under any
available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal
Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1.

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low and moderateincome persons.

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at least five
years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with the
Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement verifying
continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this division.

4.

Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is terminated prior
to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor's office a copy of any notice of
default or notice of abatement received from HUD.

c.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal, no less than 120 days prior to the
expiration of the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's Office of the application, on a
form provided by that office. Upon receiving approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the
applicant shall file an application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by
that office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter approving the contract
renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.

d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a mark up to
market option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 2001 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any
renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The classification shall continue until the
expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.
Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8 contract
renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any
renewals approved with the mark up to market option, mark up to market option under HUD's
discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation
under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of
the Section 8 contract.

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the following
three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option under HUD's
discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's
renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an
application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to termination of the contract, for renewal of the
Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the Assessor's Office of its application for
renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract
renewal, or notification of other action.

f.

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under Class S.

(14)(15) Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is
designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this division; is a landmark or contributing
building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation must constitute an
investment by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market value as determined by the
Assessor in the assessment year prior to the commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land underneath the
building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor, the land upon which the
building is situated shall also be eligible for the incentive.
b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain an
ordinance or resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is located, which
expressly states that the local government:
1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial
rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written recommendation of the project
for the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's budget and proposed
scope of work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards of the United
States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restoration, and
Reconstruction of historic properties.

c.

A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the time the
Class L eligibility application is filed but the ordinance or resolution must be filed with the Assessor
no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.

d.

If the ordinance or resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed, the applicant
shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:
1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a resolution
or ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested; and

2.

A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.

e.

A copy of the resolution or letter confirming that a resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for
distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L classification, an
eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of
substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has been completed, the preservation
commission shall review the project to determine that it is eligible under Subsection (14) of this
section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the determination
of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such substantial
rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be renewed during
the last year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are
met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
L; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify
for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts.
i.

If, as of November 23,1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment level is
higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is
higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no
renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section
74-64. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class L
recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of persons employed
at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules may
result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

Sec. 74-64. Market value percentages.
The Assessor shall assess, and the Board of Review shall review, assessments on real estate in the various
classes at the following percentages of market value:
(1) Class 1: 10 percent.

Sec. 74-65. Qualifications for commercial development project status.
(a) To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the project be located
in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(1) The area is, or has been within the last ten years, designated by Federal, State or local agency as a
conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or
project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the
Commercial Renewal Re-development Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a
Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board
on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the Commercial District Development
Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or designation of like effect adopted under any similar
statute or ordinance;
(2) Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined, remained stagnant or potential
real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of the area;
(3) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted
Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the area;
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will materially assist
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the commercial development project would
not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or 7b; and

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

(5) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is reasonably expected
to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities within the
area.
(b) Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain from the
municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the
case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section are present and
that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7a or 7b
application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance or resolution shall be included with the Class
7a or 7b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or
resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts. The application shall include
any other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the commercial
development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
(c) Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of the County,
support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of such applications, the
Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section for Class 7a
applications.
(d) The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application and
supporting data.
(e) Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient size if it
otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive offered" as provided in
Subsection (a)(4) of this section, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation
agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to
share a portion of future profits with the appropriate taxing districts.
(f) For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this
section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this division.
(g) In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary supporting
data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County. The
Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section are present. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions
of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the
Committee's findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this
division.
(h) Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new construction or
substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the commercial development
project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it is
necessary that:

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

(1) The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the County determine by lawful
resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for
private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area
without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import;
(2) The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the
area as one in need of substantial revitalization;
(3) Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall
review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the
severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial
revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to
the fact that an area is located in a Federal empowerment zone or enterprise community, as proposed and
approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.
(j)

Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial revitalization,
as defined in this division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area. In making this determination
statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area for which certification is sought
may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall be the community area as defined in
this division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area
is located.

(k) If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June
22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal resolution that the area is in
a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the
necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8 certification, such
certification shall be automatic pursuant to this division. However, each property eligible for a Class 8 incentive
within the certified area must file an application in a timely manner.
(l)

Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is defined in this division.
The renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.

Sec. 74-66. Property in two or more classes.

Class C, Class 7a, Class 7b and Class 8 shall expire on December 31, 2015, unless otherwise reviewed by
action of the County. Real estate granted a Class 6, Class 6a, Class 6b, Class 7 or Class 8 classification on or
before December 31, 1994, shall retain such classification under the terms and conditions of this division prior
to January 1, 1995. Real estate for which an application for Class 6a, Class 6b, Class 7 or Class 8 classification

(7) Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed buildings
or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, including the
land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to
the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square
footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application
to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution
is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a
letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or
Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested.

b.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

c.

Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new
construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to
abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor prior to the
commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

d.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b,
unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling
Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide
a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such

a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the
time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b.
If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall
instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming
that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance where
real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if
there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification
of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is
that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect
shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution
to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist,
as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the
Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a minimum
of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to
continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused; and

3.

The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same
property.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special circumstances, and
a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial
enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be in
imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance

supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a
municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property
is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of
special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a
certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment
appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the
Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the
County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special
circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be received
by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b incentives
granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the
industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its
operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER
Program shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that
occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy
of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports
within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the nonfiling. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive granted
pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the
case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program, this classification shall continue for a period
of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the
premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this incentive may
be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent assessment level pursuant to
section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive from the
municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is

Journal

June 18, 2014

necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
6b; and
3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's
Office before the expiration of the ten-percent assessment level period.

g.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are not
renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as
the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.

h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to
Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of
all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 6b
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the
period relating to the nonfiling.

(8) Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including abandoned
property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such property is situated; or vacant
land; where such real estate because of contamination has undergone environmental testing and
remediation and has received a "No Further Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further Remediation
Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the industrial or commercial
use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having previously
owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or being associated through
a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or operated the site, which ownership
or operation caused the contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation. A
present owner who can successfully demonstrate that the owner was not responsible for the
contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive
provided by Class C is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class C application
to the Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution must be filed at the time of application
for the Class C classification. A copy of that ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted, will be

Journal

June 18, 2014

forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of
the County Board from the affected districts.
d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be made
within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter." Where an application for Class
C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon
which remediation has been completed, the one year limitation will be waived for any subsequent
separate application for Class C classification for the remainder or for additional portions of the
property, provided that such subsequent application is made within seven years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs, including site
investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring, and engineering and
legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively,
must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's
property record card in the year prior to the remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial and
commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a
property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
C; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the
adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this
renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the effected districts.

g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level is
higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment
is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no
renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section
74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert
to the applicable classification under this division.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.
The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine eligibility for
the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to
ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under the Class C classification.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class C
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class C site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(9) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified commercial
development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need of commercial
development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting
of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or
abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is situated;
or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation
has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the
rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible
for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the
total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a. The finding
of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7a application. Not withstanding the
foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed
"abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and a resolution to that
effect shall be included with the Class 7a eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy. After such 12-year
period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7a
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7a site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(10) Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this division, comprising a
qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an "area
in need of commercial development", where total development costs, exclusive of land, exceed
$2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon
which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent
such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land
qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The
amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the
rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b. The
finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 7b application. Not
withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a
property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b and a resolution to that
effect shall be included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy.

c.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7b
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7b site. Such
reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(11) Class 7c or Commercial Urban Relief Eligibility (“CURE”). Real estate used primarily for commercial
purposes, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which
they are situated; or abandoned property, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has
added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the
rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible
for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the
total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that:
(i)

The property, site, or area is deemed a redevelopment priority by the municipality, and

(ii) The municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by
Class 7c is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7c application to the Assessor.
In order to determine Class 7c applications, an application for Class 7c shall be submitted to the Assessor
and the Bureau of Economic Development. Upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County, within 30 days return
the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(4)
of this section are present. The Assessor shall review the application, supporting data, findings of the
Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—
(a)(4) of this section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment under this division.
Where the Economic Development Advisory Committee does not return a finding stating whether the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1) – (a)(4) of this section are present within 30 days, and upon further
application of the requesting party, the Assessor may review the application, supporting data, and other
appropriate facts and certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment and grant
the incentive.
(1) That the Property’s (the real estate that is subject of the Incentive application) Assessed Value, Equalized
Assessed Value or Real estate taxes for three of the last six years, have declined or remained stagnant due
to the depressed condition;
(2) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted
Class 7c designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the property;
(3) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation will materially assist
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the property and the commercial development property
would not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7c; and
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation is reasonably expected to
ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities of the property.
A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 7c
eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 7c. If the Resolution is not filed at the time
of the eligibility application, the applicant may instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or
the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has
been requested.
b.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

Class 7c applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other structures
must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new construction or
substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 7c incentive. With respect to abandoned property, the
Class 7c application must be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the reoccupation of the
vacant and unused property. For the purpose of this Incentive [Class 7c] “abandoned property” shall mean
property where the buildings and other structures, or portions thereof, have been vacant and unused for
more than 12 continuous months and as established by rule of the Assessor.

d.

This classification shall continue for a period of 3 years from the date such new construction (excluding
demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in the case
of abandoned property, from the date of substantial occupancy.

e.

Class 7c incentives that are granted are renewable.
The incentive shall be phase out after 5 years, pursuant to Section 74-64(8). After expiration of the last
incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

f.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine eligibility and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 7c.

g.

Class 7c Applications must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2019 to

Renewal. The Class 7c Incentive shall be limited to only one (1) renewal. The applicant may apply for
a renewal on or after the 3rd Year of the Incentive, but before the expiration of the 5th Year of the
Incentive. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance and present such municipal
Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County as to whether it will validate the renewal.
The Incentive may be renewed unless otherwise limited herein.

i.

(1112)Class 8. Real estate used primarily for industrial and commercial purposes, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned
property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has
added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square
footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the
parcel. Such real estate must be either obtained through the Cook County Tax Reactivation Project
or must be located in one of the following designated geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization in accordance with the
provisions of Section 74-65(b);

located, or, if in an unincorporated area, the County must by lawful Resolution determine that
such real estate is consistent with an overall plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or
3.
b.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom; Bremen; Calumet; Rich; and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8, unless:
1.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant
and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. If the
Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to
validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a
Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling
Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance
to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will
validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide
a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such
a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 need not be filed at the
time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later
than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 8. If the Resolution is
not filed at the time of the Class 8 application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter
from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance
regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance where
real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8 under the TEERM Program, if there has been
no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 8 application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the
municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and present such
municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to
whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class
8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution
finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or
Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class
8 need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 8 application with the Assessor, but must be filed

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.

d.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or
in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of
incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval.

e.

Unless it was granted pursuant to the TEERM Program, this incentive may be renewed during the
last year a property is entitled to a ten-percent assessment level pursuant to 74-64(11), if the following
requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial or commercial use of the
property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal
of the Class 8; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's
Office before the expiration of the 10 percent assessment level period.

f.

Class 8 incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program are not renewable. For all other
Class 8 incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and meet the requirements for Class 8.

g.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected
districts.

Section 74-64(11). After expiration of the last incentive period the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

i.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of
all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 8.

j.

The certification of an area as in need of substantial revitalization shall expire five years from the
date such certification is granted. The Assessor shall notify the applicant of the date of expiration of
certification one year before the date of the expiration of the certification. Such certification, pursuant
to the same criteria, may be extended for one additional five-year period subject to reapplication by

expiration of the initial five-year period.
k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 8
recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 8 site. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board

d.

e.

Beginning January 1, 2000, the Class 9 classification shall have an initial duration of ten years from

(1314)Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division, consisting of land
and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract renewal. The
portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number of
Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied only to property used

a.

Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed pursuant
to one of the following alternatives:

sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS) violations;

ii.

The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot be
eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the
use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase the rents to the use
restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and

iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable market
rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under the mark
up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property meets at least
one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected,

 Board of Commissioners
ii.

Journal

June 18, 2014

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance difficult
to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a contribution
of state or local funds to the property.
3.

b.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation under any
available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal
Policy Guidelines.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:

At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low and moderateincome persons.

2.

The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at least five
years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with the
Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement verifying
continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this division.

4.

expiration of the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's Office of the application, on a
form provided by that office. Upon receiving approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the
applicant shall file an application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by

encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any
renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The classification shall continue until the
expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.
Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8 contract
renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any
renewals approved with the mark up to market option, mark up to market option under HUD's
discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation
under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of
the Section 8 contract.

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the following
three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option under HUD's
discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's
renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an

 Board of Commissioners

renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract
renewal, or notification of other action.
f.

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under Class S.

(1415)Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is designated

by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market value as determined by the Assessor in
the assessment year prior to the commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land underneath the
building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous
months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor, the land upon which the
building is situated shall also be eligible for the incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain an
ordinance or resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is located, which
expressly states that the local government:
1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial
rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written recommendation of the project
for the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's budget and proposed
scope of work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards of the United
States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restoration, and
Reconstruction of historic properties.

c.

A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the time the
Class L eligibility application is filed but the ordinance or resolution must be filed with the Assessor
no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.

d.

If the ordinance or resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed, the applicant
shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:

e.

1.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L classification, an
eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of
substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has been completed, the preservation
commission shall review the project to determine that it is eligible under Subsection (14) of this
section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the determination
of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such substantial
rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be renewed during
the last year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are
met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
L; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify
for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members
of the County Board from the affected districts.
i.

If, as of November 23,1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment level is
higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is
higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no
renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section
74-64. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class L
recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of persons employed

Sec. 74-65. Qualifications for commercial development project status.
(a) To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the project be located
in an area in need of commercial development in that:

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

(1) The area is, or has been within the last ten years, designated by Federal, State or local agency as a
conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or
project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the
Commercial Renewal Re-development Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a
Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board
on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the Commercial District Development
Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or designation of like effect adopted under any similar
statute or ordinance;
(2) Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined, remained stagnant or potential
real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of the area;
(3) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted
Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the area;
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will materially assist
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the commercial development project would
not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or 7b; and
(5) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is reasonably expected
to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities within the
area.
(b) Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain from the
municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the
case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section are present and
that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7a or 7b
application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance or resolution shall be included with the Class
7a or 7b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or
resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board
for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts. The application shall include
any other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the commercial
development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
(c) Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of the County,
support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of such applications, the
Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section for Class 7a
applications.
(d) The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application and
supporting data.
(e) Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient size if it
otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive offered" as provided in
Subsection (a)(4) of this section, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation
agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to
share a portion of future profits with the appropriate taxing districts.

(f) For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this
section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this division.
(g) In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary supporting
data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County. The
Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section are present. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions
of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the
Committee's findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this
division.
(h) Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new construction or
substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the commercial development
project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it is
necessary that:
(1) The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the County determine by lawful
resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for
private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area
without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import;
(2) The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the
area as one in need of substantial revitalization;
(3) Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall
review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the
severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial
revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to
the fact that an area is located in a Federal empowerment zone or enterprise community, as proposed and
approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.

(j)

Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial revitalization,
as defined in this division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area. In making this determination
statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area for which certification is sought
may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall be the community area as defined in
this division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area
is located.

(k) If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June
22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal resolution that the area is in
a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the
necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8 certification, such
certification shall be automatic pursuant to this division. However, each property eligible for a Class 8 incentive
within the certified area must file an application in a timely manner.
(l)

Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is defined in this division.
The renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.

of Class 8a designation absent abandonment when:
a.

An applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from the municipality in which the real
estate is located or the Cook County Board of Commissioners, if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an agreement to abate a portion of the local government's sales tax generated
by the industrial or commercial enterprise located on such real estate and such abatement of sales tax
must cover the period of time for which the applicant would qualify for this Class 8a incentive; and

b.

Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that due
to national and regional economic conditions beyond its control the industrial or commercial
enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at least 40 percent in the
year it makes application for this incentive as compared to the average net operating income of the
industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

c.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to, an economic impact
study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise is not economically viable and as such it will cease
operations within 60 days of the submission of an eligibility application for Class 8a designation to
the Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the property will become vacant and unused for an
extended period of time of at least 24 months; and

d.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to, an economic impact
study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
designation as a Class 8a property will allow the industrial or commercial enterprise to be
economically viable and thereby continue its operations so that the industrial or commercial
enterprise can continue to occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an extended period of time.

(2) Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that industrial or
commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at least 40
percent in the year it makes application for the incentive as compared to the average net operating
income of the industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

b.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that Class 8a designation

operations and that without such designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to become vacant and unused; and

c.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and consents to the
designation of the property as a Class 8a property absent an abandonment requirement; and

d.

benefits provided under Class 8a.
(8) Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a Class 8a designation, the Cook County Assessor shall

of Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such designation.
(1) The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a resolution or ordinance in support
of Class 8b designation when:
a.

The applicant is a hospital, as defined in the Hospital Licensing Act, or an entity that owns the real
property on which a hospital is located, the hospital is licensed by the state, and the abandonment of
the hospital would require the applicant, or the hospital on behalf of which the applicant owns the
real property on which the hospital is located, to obtain a permit or exemption from the State of
Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board pursuant to the Illinois Health Facilities
Planning Act prior to discontinuing hospital operations and to obtain a second permit or exemption
prior to reopening or otherwise reestablishing the hospital after abandonment;

b.

The applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that approval of the
Class 8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that the property will be retained for
hospital use with the associated employment benefits relative to industrial or commercial use of the
property;

c.

The subject hospital is located in a zip code which has a ten percent or greater incidence of families
and/or individuals below the poverty level, as identified by the U.S. Census Bureau's most recent

provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the following:
a.

A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that the proposed redevelopment
contemplated for the subject hospital or the property on which the hospital sits is necessary and
appropriate and that, without a classification having the impact of this section, the special

to, the unique requirement that mandates that the subject hospital's operations are continually
maintained without interruption in order for the State of Illinois Health Facilities and Services
Review Board to issue a certificate of need and licensure approval for the continued operation of the
subject hospital and the extraordinary need for the continued operation of the subject hospital within
the applicable region, will not be addressed and the property on which the subject hospital sits will
become vacant and underutilized and cause the continued exasperation of blighted factors within the
municipality and region;

b.

A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that a classification having the impact of
this section is necessary for the redevelopment to occur on the property on which the subject hospital
sits; and

required municipal approval after July 1, 2008, for hospital property where the property was acquired for
hospital use by an unrelated for-profit acquirer, avoiding the Health Facilities and Services Review Board
discontinuation approval, shall be reconsidered as an application pursuant to this section upon supplement
of such Class 8 application with the additional information required in this section, if any. Upon receipt

project, if required by statute to be assessed in the lowest assessment category;
c. Improved with a building put to commercial and residential use, of six or less units where the building

d. Real estate improved with a single room occupancy building, as defined in this division, provided that:
1. At least one-third of the single room occupancy units are leased at no more than 80 percent of the current
"Fair Market Rent Schedule for Existing Housing for Single Room Occupancy Units" as set by the United
States Department of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter "FMR schedule");
2. No single room occupancy units are leased at rents in excess of 100 percent of the current FMR schedule;
3. The overall maximum average rent per unit for all single room occupancy units in the building shall not
exceed 90 percent of the current FMR schedule; and
4. The subject property is in substantial compliance with all local building, safety and health codes and

(3) Class 3. All improved real estate used for residential purposes which is not included in any other class.
(4) Class 4. Real estate owned and used by a not-for-profit corporation in furtherance of the purposes set forth
in its charter unless used for residential purposes. If such real estate is used for residential purposes, it shall

(7) Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed buildings
or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, including the
land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to
the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the
improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square
footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a. An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is
necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the
case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance
or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must
be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class
6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time,

b. A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed with
the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to
the members of the County Board from the affected districts.
c. Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other structures
must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new construction or substantial
rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to abandoned property, the Class 6b application must
be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.
d. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b, unless:
1. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant and
unused prior to such purchase; or
2. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for less than 24 continuous months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included
in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance
or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to
that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to
that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as
well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property
is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding
special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance where
real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the
County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if there has
been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at
least 12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class
6b application under the TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the
approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County

County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor,
but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the
class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the
applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be,
confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not meet the
definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case
may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed
"qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1. The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a minimum
of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;
2. The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise to
continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such designation
the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to be in imminent
risk of becoming vacant and unused; and
3. The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same property.
The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is necessary for the
industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that
without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused, shall be included in the Resolution
or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution
is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding
that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that
effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the
required finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County
Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special
circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating
such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at
the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no
later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the
Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at that
time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be
received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number of
persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether
the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application continues its
operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the

 Board of Commissioners

SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise
that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A
copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County
Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file
such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive
for the period relating to the nonfiling. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the
premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b
incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e. This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction (excluding
demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in the case of
abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the
TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER
Program, this classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until
the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that
location if that occurs sooner.
f. Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent assessment level pursuant to section 74-64(7), if
the following requirements are met:
1. The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive from the
municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;
2. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is located in
an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or the County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to
the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b; and
3. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's Office
before the expiration of the ten-percent assessment level period.
g. Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are not renewable.
For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.
h. A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary
of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts.
i. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 7464(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under
this division.
j. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 6b.
k. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 6b recipients
as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. A copy of such reports will
be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the
County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.

(8) Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including abandoned
property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such property is situated; or vacant land; where
such real estate because of contamination has undergone environmental testing and remediation and has received a
"No Further Remediation Letter" from the site remediation program.
a. To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further Remediation
Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the industrial or commercial use.
b. The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having previously owned
or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or being associated through a family or business
relationship with anyone who has owned or operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the
contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation. A present owner who can successfully
demonstrate that the owner was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.
c. An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality
or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class C is necessary for
development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be,
supports and consents to the Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution
must be filed at the time of application for the Class C classification. A copy of that ordinance or resolution,
whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to
the members of the County Board from the affected districts.
d. To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be made within one
year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter." Where an application for Class C classification
encompasses less than all of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon which remediation has been
completed, the one year limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate application for Class C classification
for the remainder or for additional portions of the property, provided that such subsequent application is made
within seven years.
e. Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs, including site
investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring, and engineering and legal fees
associated with the remediation process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25
percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's property record card in the year prior
to the remediation, whichever is less.
f. The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial and commercial
property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16
percent assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
1. The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the incentive
from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;
2. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is located in
an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as
the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the
local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class C; and
3. A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the Assessor
before the expiration of the 16 percent assessment level period.

 Board of Commissioners

June 18, 2014

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify for
Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the adoption date of the
ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this renewal term at the end of their
original incentive period subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request renewal
which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of
the Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the effected districts.
g. If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level is higher than
16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16 percent assessment level for the
prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as
of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of
the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive
will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to
Section 74-64. After such ten-year period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.
h. For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial Class C
incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real estate shall revert to
the applicable classification under this division.
i. The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine eligibility for the
Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under the Class
C classification.
j. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class C recipients
as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class C site. Such reports shall be verified.
Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the nonfiling.
(9) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified commercial development
project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need of commercial development,
where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly
constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned
property, as defined in this division, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings
and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their
value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical
or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such
proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the
improvements on the parcel.
a. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify
that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a. The finding of abandonment, along with
the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the resolution or ordinance supporting
and consenting to the Class 7a application. Not withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not
be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant and
unused prior to such purchase; or

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

B. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for less than 24 continuous months.
Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or resolution is
that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a and a resolution to that effect shall be included
with the Class 7a eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b. This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction (excluding
demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in the case of
abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy. After such 12-year period, the real estate
shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.
c. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7a recipients
as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7a site. Such reports shall be
verified. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss
of the incentive for the period relating to the nonfiling.
(10) Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this division, comprising a
qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an "area in
need of commercial development", where total development costs, exclusive of land, exceed $2,000,000.00,
consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are
situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such property is situated;
or all buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has
added to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the
rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for
the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total
square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b. The finding of abandonment,
along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the resolution or ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 7b application. Not withstanding the foregoing, special
circumstances may not be determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant and
unused prior to such purchase; or
B. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for less than 24 continuous months.
Such resolution or ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or resolution
is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a finding that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b and a resolution to that effect shall be
included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
b. This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction
(excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed,
or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy.

(11) Class 7c or Commercial Urban Relief Eligibility (“CURE”). Real estate used primarily for commercial
purposes, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which
they are situated; or abandoned property, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all
buildings and other structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added
to their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation
adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive
shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage
of the improvements on the parcel.
a. An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that:
(i) The property, site, or area is deemed a redevelopment priority by the municipality, and
(ii) The municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by
Class 7c is necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7c application to the Assessor.
In order to determine Class 7c applications, an application for Class 7c shall be submitted to the
Assessor and the Bureau of Economic Development. Upon receipt of the application and all the
necessary supporting data, the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County, within 30
days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the conditions of Subsections
(a)(1)-(a)(4) of this section are present. The Assessor shall review the application, supporting data,
findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions of
Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the
Committee's findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment under
this division.
Where the Economic Development Advisory Committee does not return a finding stating whether the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1) - (a)(4) of this section are present within 30 days, and upon further
application of the requesting party, the Assessor may review the application, supporting data, and
other appropriate facts and certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment
and grant the incentive.

Equalized Assessed Value or Real estate taxes for three of the last six years, have declined or remained
stagnant due to the depressed condition;
(2) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if
granted Class 7c designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the property;
(3) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation will materially assist
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the property and the commercial development
property would not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7c; and

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7c designation is reasonably expected to
ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities of the
property.
A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 7c
eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 7c. If the Resolution is not filed at the
time of the eligibility application, the applicant may instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance supporting
the incentive has been requested.
b. A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed with
the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to
the members of the County Board from the affected districts.
c. Class 7c applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other structures
must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new construction or substantial
rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 7c incentive. With respect to abandoned property, the Class 7c application must
be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property. For the
purpose of this Incentive [Class 7c] “abandoned property” shall mean property where the buildings and other
structures, or portions thereof, have been vacant and unused for more than 12 continuous months and as established
by rule of the Assessor.

demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in the case of
abandoned property, from the date of substantial occupancy.

The incentive shall be phase out after 5 years, pursuant to Section 74-64(8). After expiration of the last
incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this division.
f. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine eligibility and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 7c.
g. Class 7c Applications must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2019 to receive
consideration.

Commissioners of Cook County as to whether it will validate the renewal. The Incentive may be renewed unless
otherwise limited herein.
i. Effective Year. The Class 7c Incentive shall be effective for the tax year the application for the Incentive
is filed. In addition, the Class 7c Incentive may be applied for only one year prior to the tax year in which the

value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The
amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation

consistent with an overall plan for the rehabilitation of the area; or
3. Any one of the following five townships: Bloom; Bremen; Calumet; Rich; and Thornton.
b. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 8, unless:
1. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant and
unused prior to such purchase; or
2. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for less than 24 continuous months.

in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. If the Ordinance
or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such, a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a Resolution to that effect
shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding
of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8 and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy

that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance where

no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least
12 continuous months. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class
8 application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board

3. The Assessor determines that all application qualifications, except the major rehabilitation or new
construction requirement, were maintained during the incentive period.
e. When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is terminated by action of the owner or the Assessor, the
property owner shall, in a manner and form determined by the Assessor, notify all Class 9 tenants of the date of the
termination of Class 9 classification. Once the Class 9 classification is terminated, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.
(1314) Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this division, consisting of land and
existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract renewal. The portion of
the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number of Section 8 units
bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied only to property used for residential
purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
a. Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed pursuant to one
of the following alternatives:
1. HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market option, after finding
that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an inspection by HUD's Real
Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair
with no uncorrected exigent health and safety (EHS) violations;

ii. The property does not have a low- and moderate-income use restriction that cannot be eliminated
by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the use restriction,
HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase the rents to the use restriction level, which
would be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and
iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable market rents are
above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2. HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to
market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property meets at least one of the
required criteria:

A vulnerable population is affected,

ii. There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance difficult to use,
or a lack of comparable housing, or
iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a contribution of state
or local funds to the property.
3. HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation under any available
option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines.
b. Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1. At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low and moderate-income
persons.
2. The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at least five years
after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.
3. For the duration of the Class S classification period, applicant must file annually with the Assessor, on
or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement verifying continuous compliance with
the Class S provisions of this division.
4. Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is terminated prior to its
expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor's office a copy of any notice of default or notice
of abatement received from HUD.
c. When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal, no less than 120 days prior to the expiration of
the contract, the applicant shall notify the Assessor's Office of the application, on a form provided by that office.
Upon receiving approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the applicant shall file an application for the incentive
with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by that office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's
letter approving the contract renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.
d. Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a mark up to market
option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 2001 assessment year encompassed within the
contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark up to
market option. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.
Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8 contract renewal
may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment year encompassed within the contract
term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark up to market
option, mark up to market option under HUD's discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed
by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's
Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of the
Section 8 contract.
e. The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the following three
options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option under HUD's discretionary authority; or
3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in
HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to
termination of the contract, for renewal of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the Assessor's

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

Office of its application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval
of the contract renewal, or notification of other action.
f. The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of
all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under Class S.
(1415) Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is designated as
Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this division; is a landmark or contributing building; and
has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation must constitute an investment by the
owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market value as determined by the Assessor in the
assessment year prior to the commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.
a. Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land underneath the
building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months prior to the
filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor, the land upon which the building is situated shall also be
eligible for the incentive.
b. Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain an ordinance or
resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is located, which expressly states that the local
government:
1. Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial rehabilitation of
the property;
2. Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and
3. Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written recommendation of the project for
the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's budget and proposed scope of
work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards of the United States
Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restoration, and Reconstruction of historic
properties.
c. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the time the Class L
eligibility application is filed but the ordinance or resolution must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date
an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.
d. If the ordinance or resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed, the applicant shall
instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:
1. A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a resolution or
ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested; and
2. A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.
e. A copy of the resolution or letter confirming that a resolution has been requested, whichever is filed with
the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts.
f. Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L classification, an eligibility
application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation.
After the substantial rehabilitation has been completed, the preservation commission shall review the project to
determine that it is eligible under Subsection (14) of this section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility

application with a copy of the determination of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real estate
as Class L.
g. The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such substantial
rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.
h. For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be renewed during the
last year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
1. The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the incentive
from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;
2. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is located in
an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as
the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the
local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class L; and
3. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the Assessor
before the expiration of the incentive period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify for
Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of
the County Board from the affected districts.
i. If, as of November 23,1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment level is higher
than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16 percent assessment level
for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application.
However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted
a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of
the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two (2)
years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this Division.
j. For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the commercial Class L
incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real estate shall revert to
the applicable classification under this Division.
k. The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors
relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under Class L.
l. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class L recipients
as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class L site. Failure
to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the incentive for the
period relating to the non-filing.
Sec. 74-64. Market value percentages.
The Assessor shall assess, and the Board of Review shall review, assessments on real estate in the various
classes at the following percentages of market value:
(1)

Class 1: 10 percent.

(a) To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the project be
located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(1) The area is, or has been within the last ten years, designated by Federal, State or local agency as a

Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or designation of like effect adopted under any similar statute
or Ordinance;
(2) Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined, remained stagnant or potential
real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of the area;
(3) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the commercial
development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted Class 7a or
7b designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the area;
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will materially assist
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the commercial development project would
not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or 7b; and
(5) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is reasonably expected
to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities within the
area.
(b) Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain from the
municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has
determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section are present and that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7a or 7b application to the Assessor. A
certified copy of such Ordinance or Resolution shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the time of
filing the application with the Assessor. A copy of the Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County
Board from the affected districts. The application shall include any other information deemed necessary by the
Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the commercial development project qualifies for the Class 7a or
7b classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
(c) Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of the County,
support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of such applications, the
Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this section for Class 7a
applications.
(d) The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application and
supporting data.
(e) Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient size if it
otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive offered" as provided in
Subsection (a)(4) of this Section, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation
agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share
a portion of future profits with the appropriate taxing districts.
(f) For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this
section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data, certify
the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Division.
(g) In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary supporting
data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County. The
Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the conditions
of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section are present. The Assessor shall review the application, supporting data,

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections
(a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this Division.
(h) Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new construction
or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the commercial development
project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i) To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it is
necessary that:
(1) The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the County determine by
lawful Resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically
feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and
development of the area without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar
import;
(2) The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of
the area as one in need of substantial revitalization;
(3) Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial revitalization, the Assessor
shall review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a determination
of the severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial
revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight
to the fact that an area is located in a Federal empowerment zone or enterprise community, as proposed
and approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.
(j) Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this Division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area. In making this
determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area for which certification is
sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall be the community area as defined
in this Division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area is
located.
(k) If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June
22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal Resolution that the area is in a
state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the
necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and encouragement,
or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8 certification, such certification shall be
automatic pursuant to this Division. However, each property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified
area must file an application in a timely manner.
(l) Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is defined in this division.
The renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.
Sec. 74-66. Property in two or more classes.
Where a single parcel of real estate is partially included in two or more of the above-described classes, each
portion shall be assessed at the assessment level herein prescribed for that class.

use of the property prior to application for the incentive does not comply with the definition of abandoned property
provided for in Section 74-62(b), can receive a designation as a Class 8a property so long as the applicant can show
that it has complied with all of the requirements necessary to receive a Class 8 designation per Sections 74-62

a. An applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from the municipality in which the real
estate is located or the Cook County Board of Commissioners, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area,
an agreement to abate a portion of the local government's sales tax generated by the industrial or commercial
enterprise located on such real estate and such abatement of sales tax must cover the period of time for which the
applicant would qualify for this Class 8a incentive; and
b. Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that due to
national and regional economic conditions beyond its control the industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone
a significant reduction in net operating income of at least 40 percent in the year it makes application for this incentive
as compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three (3)
years; and
c. Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to, an economic impact
study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the ongoing industrial
or commercial enterprise is not economically viable and as such it will cease operations within 60 days of the
submission of an eligibility application for Class 8a designation to the Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the
property will become vacant and unused for an extended period of time of at least 24 months; and
d. Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to, an economic impact
study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that designation as a Class
8a property will allow the industrial or commercial enterprise to be economically viable and thereby continue its
operations so that the industrial or commercial enterprise can continue to occupy and fully utilize the real estate for
an extended period of time.
(2) Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a. A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that industrial or commercial
enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at least 40 percent in the year it makes
application for the incentive as compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or commercial
enterprise in the prior three years; and
b. A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that Class 8a designation of
the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that
without such designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the
property to become vacant and unused; and
c. A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and consents to the
designation of the property as a Class 8a property absent an abandonment requirement; and
d. A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and consents to the
application made to the Cook County Assessor requesting designation as a Class 8a property absent an abandonment
requirement.
(3) When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a Class 8a
property is sought using the provisions of this Section, the municipality in which the real estate is
located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a Resolution or Ordinance that contains the
following:
a. A finding by the municipality that it has determined that Class 8a designation of the property is
necessary for the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that
without such designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would not be economically viable
causing the property to become vacant and unused; and

be limited to five (5) years only and such Class 8a designation shall not be renewed:
a. After the initial application has been approved and granted, if the subject real estate receiving the Class 8a
designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section is sold or the applicant transfers ownership of any
portion of the property at any time prior to the five (5) year term of the 8a classification, then the property's
Class 8a classification shall be subject to an eligibility review by the Cook County Board of Commissioners,
the municipality, and the Assessor under the procedures set forth in this Ordinance for the remainder of the
five (5) year term.
(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8a designation an eligibility application must be made to the
Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation can not be applied to real estate unless the following has occurred: application is
made to the Cook County Assessor; all required municipal and county Ordinances and Resolutions are
provided to the Cook County Assessor; and the Cook County Assessor determines that the real estate
which is the subject of the application for a Class 8a designation would qualify for designation as a Class
8 property but for the inability to comply with the definition of abandonment pursuant to Section 7462(b).

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this Section to determine eligibility for the
benefits provided under Class 8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a Class 8a designation, the Cook County Assessor shall
forward such application and any supporting documentation provided with such application to the Cook
County Board of Commissioners or its designee for consideration as to whether the County Board will
provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a Class 8a designation absent abandonment.

(9)

Real estate receiving a Class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall not be eligible
for a Class 8a designation for any year prior to the assessment year for which an application for the

(13) Real estate that receives a designation as a Class 8a incentive property will lose such designation and the
corresponding reduced level of assessment upon termination of the required partial sales tax abatement
by local government.
[(14)] This Section 74-70 of the Real Estate Classification Ordinance will become effective upon passage.
(b) Class 8b. Real estate and improvements that house inpatient and outpatient hospital based services, where
the property has been acquired for hospital use by a for-profit acquirer unrelated to the not-for-profit
disposer, thereby avoiding Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation approval,
shall be considered for a Class 8b designation if it meets the requirements of this Section and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners provides a Resolution or Ordinance in support of such designation.
(1) The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a Resolution or Ordinance in
support of Class 8b designation when:
a. The applicant is a hospital, as defined in the Hospital Licensing Act, or an entity that owns the real
property on which a hospital is located, the hospital is licensed by the state, and the abandonment of the hospital
would require the applicant, or the hospital on behalf of which the applicant owns the real property on which the
hospital is located, to obtain a permit or exemption from the State of Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review
Board pursuant to the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing hospital operations and to obtain
a second permit or exemption prior to reopening or otherwise reestablishing the hospital after abandonment;
b. The applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that approval of the Class
8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that the property will be retained for hospital use with the
associated employment benefits relative to industrial or commercial use of the property;
c. The subject hospital is located in a zip code which has a ten percent or greater incidence of families
and/or individuals below the poverty level, as identified by the U.S. Census Bureau's most recent census; and
d. The subject hospital employs at least 750 full-time equivalents (full-time equivalent jobs being defined
as total hours worked by all non full-time employees divided by average annual hours worked by the full-time
employees).
(2) Such a Resolution or Ordinance must contain:
a. A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the applicant
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that approval of the Class 8b designation
will materially increase the likelihood that the property will be retained for hospital use; and
b. A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and consents to the
designation of the property as a Class 8b property.
(3) When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a Class 8b property
is sought using the provisions of this section, the municipality in which the real estate is located must
provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the following:
a. A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that the proposed redevelopment
contemplated for the subject hospital or the property on which the hospital sits is necessary and appropriate and
that, without a classification having the impact of this section, the special circumstances that exist on the property
on which the subject hospital sits including, but not limited to, the unique requirement that mandates that the subject
hospital's operations are continually maintained without interruption in order for the State of Illinois Health

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

June 18, 2014

Facilities and Services Review Board to issue a certificate of need and licensure approval for the continued operation
of the subject hospital and the extraordinary need for the continued operation of the subject hospital within the
applicable region, will not be addressed and the property on which the subject hospital sits will become vacant and
underutilized and cause the continued exasperation of blighted factors within the municipality and region;
b. A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that a classification having the impact of this
section is necessary for the redevelopment to occur on the property on which the subject hospital sits; and
c. A statement by the corporate authorities of the municipality supporting and consenting to the filing of
an application for a classification having the impact of this Section for the property on which the subject hospital
sits.
(4) Real estate receiving a Class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be assessed at
the lowest percentage of market value and for the term provided for in Section 74-64(1112).
(5) In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8b designation, a Class 8 or Class 8b application must be made
or have been made to the Cook County Assessor. Any application for Class 8 submitted with required
municipal approval after July 1, 2008, for hospital property where the property was acquired for hospital
use by an unrelated for-profit acquirer, avoiding the Health Facilities and Services Review Board
discontinuation approval, shall be reconsidered as an application pursuant to this section upon supplement
of such Class 8 application with the additional information required in this section, if any. Upon receipt
of an application, the Cook County Assessor shall forward such application and any supporting
documentation provided with the application to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for consideration
as to whether the Cook County Board will provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a Class 8b
designation. Real estate receiving a Class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
be eligible for such designation beginning in the assessment year during which an application for the
classification having the impact of this Section is made to the Cook County Assessor.
(6) Class 8b designation cannot be applied to real estate unless the following has occurred: application is made
or has been made to the Cook County Assessor, and all required municipal and county Ordinances and
Resolutions are provided to the Cook County Assessor.
Sec. 74-71. Definition.
Property tax incentive for the purpose of applicability of the Living Wage pursuant to Section 34-160 of the
County's Code means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Chapter 74, Article II, Division 2 of this
Code for owner-occupied Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily residential
property. For the purpose of this article, "property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted

persons with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certified by the State Department of Public Aid pursuant to
Chapter 74, Article II, Division 2 of this Code, the County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance.
Sales tax means the Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax.
Sec. 74-72. Living wage requirement.
Unless expressly waived by the County Board, not less than a Living Wage, as defined in the Cook County
Procurement Code, shall be paid to each Employee of any Employer that receives a Property Tax Incentive for
owner-occupied property. Each Employer receiving a Property Tax Incentive shall comply with all the
requirements and procedures set forth in the County Code Chapter 34 with regard to such Living Wage, including
notification of Employees and all other requirements.

Sec. 74-73 Revocation or Cancellation of Incentive Classification
(a) The following Incentive Classifications are subject to revocation herein: Class 7c
(b) The incentive may be revoked under the following circumstances:
1. By rule, as provided by the Assessor;
2. By the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance;

which the incentive was revoked or cancelled as to the subject property. In such an instance, the taxpayer shall be
liable for and shall reimburse to the County Collector an amount equal to the difference in the amount of taxes that
would have been collected had the subject property been assessed as a Class 5 property and the amount of taxes
collected under the Incentive Classification as determined by the Assessor.
Effective date: This Substitute Ordinance Amendment shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE RECORDER OF DEEDS AND DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS
AFFAIRS TO IMPLEMENT A VETERANS’ AND MILITARY DISCOUNT CARD PROGRAM
WHEREAS, though there is no way to adequately repay our nation’s military personnel for their service and
sacrifice, we can demonstrate our gratitude by forging a collaborative effort between businesses and government
that will connect veterans and active-duty military personnel with merchants who choose to honor their military
service through special discounts and promotions; and
WHEREAS, the discount card program, to be named after adoption of this resolution by mutual assent of the
relevant County departments and agencies including, but not limited to, the Bureau of Administration, the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, and the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ Office, will provide veterans - those
honorably discharged and other veterans generally discharged for reasons other than discipline, misconduct,
resignation in lieu of misconduct charges, unfitness for duty, voluntary resignation, or court martial - and military
personnel currently serving our country, with discount cards that can be used at recruited merchants throughout
Cook County who agree to honor the card by providing holders with a discount on goods and services, or another
appropriate money-saving promotion of their choice; and
WHEREAS, the veterans’ and military discount card program will be mutually beneficial, helping veterans save
money with discounts on goods and services, and helping business owners to enjoy increased traffic and sales in
their stores; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ Office operates a Veterans Service Office, whose main
function is to record, safeguard and retrieve DD-214 military discharge records, which are documents issued to
servicemen or women upon completion of their service; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ Office will issue and produce the veteran identification cards;
the Cook County Recorder will use DD-214 military discharge records in conjunction with photo identification
such as a driver’s license, state ID card, federal military or Veterans Affairs ID, or passport, to issue the card to
veterans; in the case of active-duty military, a valid military ID or other official government identification that
denotes active-duty service, and photo ID if needed, will be used; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Veterans Affairs Division within the Cook County Bureau of Administration
already has the outreach capabilities to let our servicemen and veterans know about this program, and the
Recorder’s Office will assist with promoting this and other Cook County veterans’ benefits; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Office of the Cook County Board President may
also disseminate information and assist in this program; and

WHEREAS, traditionally the County has financed its Capital Projects primarily through long-term borrowing;
and
WHEREAS, the County has determined that tax-exempt, revolving lines of credit (each, a “Revolver”) issued by
a bank or banks will provide a cost efficient means to finance its Capital Projects on a tax-exempt basis and that
such Revolvers are expected to ultimately be refinanced with tax-exempt long-term bonds; and
WHEREAS, under the Master Bond Ordinance, any amounts drawn under a Revolver (“Advances”) are Variable
Rate Bonds and are Direct Purchase Bonds purchased by the bank providing such Revolver; and
WHEREAS, the County has determined that a Revolver will assist the County in achieving its goals of eliminating
negative arbitrage in project funds, minimizing costs associated with undrawn balances, achieving the lowest rate
available in the current short-term market and mitigating structural, credit, liquidity and operational risk; and
WHEREAS, in order to achieve the County’s aforementioned goals, it may be necessary and desirable for the
County to issue additional Variable Rate Bonds by entering into an agreement or agreements with a bank or banks
(each a “Revolver Bank”) to provide a Revolver or Revolvers to the County; and
WHEREAS, in order to clarify that Advances are Variable Rate Bonds and Direct Purchase Bonds under the Master
Bond Ordinance which may be directly purchased by a Revolver Bank and that such Advances are also Capital
Project Bonds under the Master Bond Ordinance, the Board has heretofore and it hereby expressly is determined
that it is advisable and necessary to amend the Master Bond Ordinance, for the purposes stated herein; and
WHEREAS, the County has determined to enter into an agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”)
pursuant to which PNC will provide a Revolver to the County (the “PNC Revolver”); and
WHEREAS, any Advances drawn pursuant to the PNC Revolver will be secured by a Trust Indenture by and
between the County and a trustee to be selected by the County, securing $125,000,000 General Obligation Bonds,
Series 2014B (the “2014B Indenture”) in accord with such financial policies as are approved by the Board and
contained within the annual budget resolution; and
WHEREAS, the Board has heretofore and it hereby expressly is determined that it is advisable and necessary to
(a) enter into the 2014B Indenture, the form of which has been prepared and is present at this meeting and (b) to
enter into an agreement with PNC and execute any related documents (collectively, the “PNC Revolver
Agreement”) in forms approved by the Chief Financial Officer of the County (the “Chief Financial Officer”)
pursuant to which PNC will provide the PNC Revolver to the County.

As current, Legal Services, Account 263, is tracking lower than expected, 33% spent with 50% of
FY2014 completed.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally budgeted
in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Legal Services spending is tracking lower than budgeted due to the dynamic nature of claims.

Total Adjusted Amount: $15,900,000.00
Summary: As the design plans progressed, the project became increasingly complicated by involvement with
the Cities of Des Plaines and Park Ridge, the Township of Maine, and the Illinois Department of Transportation.
This coordination caused lengthy delays to the project due to numerous requests for design
plan
changes.
Further, there were many issues to resolve including utility conflicts, parking accommodations and
easements/right-of-way acquisition.
Subsequently, the project scope was expanded to extend the southern limit of the improvement from Ballard
Road to Dempster Street (0.26 miles). Further, similar improvements were added along intersecting
Ballard
Road (0.32 miles) and along intersecting Emerson Street (0.13 miles). Further, a portion of the scheduled
Greenwood Avenue detour route was determined to be in too poor condition to be safely utilized as a detour route.
Thus, Greenwood Avenue was improved from Carol Street to Davis Street (0.45 miles) by milling and resurfacing
the existing pavement, including full-depth patching with curb and gutter repairs.
Additional funding was required due to the increased length of the project (from 0.74 miles to a net length of 1.90
miles) and expansion of the improvement scope to include reconstruction of the adjoining sections of Ballard
Road and Emerson Street, removal and replacement of the existing Potter Road bridge over Prairie Creek which
required undercutting of the existing creek bed to provide a suitable foundation for the new box culvert, removal
and replacement of existing drainage structures, removal and replacement of the traffic signals for three
intersections, water main improvements for three separate agencies, removal of an unknown existing water main
in conflict with proposed water main installation and the compensation of premium time for the Contractor to
expedite completion due to utility conflicts, additional concrete pavement removal not originally included in the
plans, additional temporary pavement needed for winter safety, additional earth excavation needed to properly
construct the new pavement, additional trench backfill for the storm sewer, geotechnical fabric for ground
stabilization to properly prepare the sub-grade for the proposed pavement, reconstruction of intersecting streets to
the curb return, pavement markings, sidewalks, landscaping with tree plantings, detour routing including
Greenwood Avenue improvements, additional construction engineering due to the expanded project scope
and
significantly higher construction costs due to the lapse in time from the 1985 Improvement Resolution approval to
the 2008 contract letting date. This project was accepted following a final inspection on July 21, 2011 and this
supplement is necessary for accounting cost closure.

specific real estate. The municipal Resolution cites the special circumstances include that the property has been
vacant for over 24 months and there will be no purchase for value; and

Summary: Under the IGA, Cook County will receive a 20-year IRU for eight strands of dark fiber optic cable
from the Illinois Century Network, which the State of Illinois’ Central Management Services manages. The dark
fiber will run from approximately I-57 and South Halsted Street to 350 E. Cermak Road in Chicago. These
fibers will enable the County to take the next step in creating a high-speed 10 Gigabit broadband network
connecting Oak Forest Health Clinic and Markham Courthouse to the County’s downtown campus. In exchange,
the County will pay CMS a one-time upfront fee of $40,944 and an annual maintenance fee of $7,080 in each year
of the 20-year agreement. Additionally, Cook County will pay its proportionate share of any non-routine
maintenance and repair costs, along with CMS and other entities that hold IRUs in the same fiber path.

allow the County to enter into the Chicago Utility Alert Network (CUAN) Membership Agreement, more
commonly known as DIGGER. The DIGGER network is the City of Chicago’s equivalent of JULIE (the statewide
underground facility notification service). As with JULIE elsewhere in the State, excavators and public safety
officials in Chicago use DIGGER as a comprehensive record of underground facilities in Chicago’s public way and
private property. This system also notifies all members of planned and emergency immediate excavations. Since
Cook County now owns and operates underground fiber optic cables as part of its broadband initiative, the County
seeks to enter into the CUAN/DIGGER agreement. Allowing the County’s CIO to execute the CUAN/DIGGER
agreement will allow the County to follow the State of Illinois’ model in registering governmental underground
broadband fibers in Chicago. Doing so will also enable the public to be alerted to the existence of the County’s
underground fiber, will protect the County’s investment in its broadband network, and will decrease the likelihood
of accident associated with unregistered underground cables.

PUBLIC DEFENDER
14-1655
Presented by: ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender of Cook County
PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Public Defender
Grantee: Public Defender
Grantor: Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: To acquire three (3) social workers or social service/community outreach workers to work with youth
that are processed through the Cook County Juvenile Court system each year. Staff will target this
highly
vulnerable and educationally disengaged population by assessing our client’s needs and strengths, or advocate for
services while a youth is under supervision or probation. In addition, Staff will help gather information such as
mental health history, family situation, educational engagement, current services being received, services needed,
or any other relevant information. This information along with testimony or other documentation from the social
workers would be used to support arguments regarding programming and services verses detainment, mitigation to
combat transfer to adult court, or alternative solutions to violating a youth’s probation.
In essence, the social workers would act as advocates for the youth as they move through their supervision,
reengaging youth in school, connecting them to needed services, and finding potential alternative
placements
when a youth is having a crisis at home. All of these efforts would help to keep a youth from violating probation
while also giving them the support they need to complete their supervision and achieve positive outcomes in the
future.
