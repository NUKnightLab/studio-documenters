access to adequate nutritious food for a healthy lifestyle; and
WHEREAS, 262,240, or just under 1 in 5 children in Cook County are experiencing food insecurity; and
WHEREAS, food insecurity is experienced in every community area in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, hunger increases health care costs, lowers workers' productivity, harms children's development, and
diminishes children's educational performance; and
WHEREAS, fighting hunger is a public-private partnership; in Cook County, a strong private network exists that
has provided 680,000 million people in Cook County with more than 65 million pounds of food in Fiscal Year
2013; however, private charity cannot do it alone and a strong federal hunger relief safety net is required; and
WHEREAS, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the cornerstone to the federal food and
nutrition safety net; and
WHEREAS, SNAP is the cornerstone of the nutrition safety net, with 1,016,210 Cook County residents enrolled
in the program; just under half of those utilizing the program are children; and
WHEREAS, SNAP provides an important economic stimulus to Cook County’s communities, with every dollar
in SNAP support spent generating $1.79 in economic activity; and
WHEREAS, any reduction in funding of or change in policy that seeks to exclude individuals participating in
SNAP will increase the number of food-insecure people in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, threats to SNAP, exist in the current effort to reauthorize the Farm Bill; and
WHEREAS, Congress has proposed to cut up to $39 billion from SNAP in the Farm Bill, which would result in
tremendous hardship for Cook County residents; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County seeks to encourage Congress to protect SNAP and support a Farm Bill with a
strong Title IV that protects and strengthens federal food and nutrition programs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board President and the Board of
Commissioners hereby are opposed to cuts in SNAP in the Farm Bill or the federal government’s annual
budgeting process; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered to the members of the

Agriculture.

SUPPORT FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL BENEFITS FAIRNESS
FOR FILIPINO VETERANS ACT
WHEREAS, Filipino Americans have served in the United States Armed Forces with distinction and honor in all
wars and military engagements since World War II and as such are deserving of full veterans benefits; and
WHEREAS, in 1946, Congress passed the Rescission Act which stripped Filipino veterans of full veterans
benefits, granting them only half instead, despite their U.S. citizenship and legal permanent residency; and
WHEREAS, in 2001, Congress passed a law granting full veteran benefits to U.S. citizen or U.S. legal permanent
resident Filipino veterans who served in World War II, provided they resided in the U.S.; and
WHEREAS, Filipino veterans who served during World War II include units of the Philippine Commonwealth
Army under U.S. command, the New Philippine Scouts, and recognized guerrilla forces; and
WHEREAS, the 2001 Congressional authorization did not stipulate a specific residency requirement yet the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) instituted one which resulted in a determination to cut benefits by half if it
was not met; and
WHEREAS, Filipino veterans are the only group of veterans subject to the VA residency requirements despite
their valiant service to our country, receiving only half their well-earned benefits if they reside outside the U.S.
for more than 60 consecutive days or more than 183 days in a calendar year; and
WHEREAS, the benefits which are affected include service-connected disability care, dependency and indemnity
compensation, education benefits for their children, survivor benefits, and burial allowance; and
WHEREAS, Filipino veterans must submit documentation of any travel outside the country, including copies of
their passport visas and reentry permits with entrance and exit date stamps, to have their benefits reinstated to
which they are entitled yet often their case determination is pending in a backlog of cases in the Manila Office of
the VA; and
WHEREAS, U.S. citizen and legal permanent resident veterans should not be held to a stricter residency standard
in order to receive their benefits when non-veteran legal permanent residents are able to travel outside of the
country for a year before it negatively affects their immigration status; and
WHEREAS, the Benefits Fairness for Filipino Veterans Act, introduced by U.S. Senator Dick Durbin as S. 1559
and by U.S. Representatives Luís Gutiérrez, Tammy Duckworth, William Enyart and Cheri Bustos as H.R.3207,
would do away with the restrictive VA residency requirements and instead institute a residency requirement
aligned with that for permanent legal residents of one year, affording them equal treatment with the rest of the
U.S. population.

municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances justify finding that the
property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and

the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the

PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT AMENDMENT
Department: Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Other Part(ies): Cook County Board of Commissioners and Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services
Request: Approval of Seventh Amendment to Interagency Agreement
Goods or Services: This amendment provides for adjustments to the County’s quarterly transfer payments to the
state pursuant to BIPA intergovernmental transfer agreement.
Agreement Number: 2014-36-001(Tracking Number)
Agreement Period: This agreement will become effective upon execution.
Fiscal Impact: $30,000,000.00
Accounts: 491-763
Summary: The Benefits and Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) was passed by Congress to
counter the severe cutbacks in payments resulting from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Pursuant
to
the
intergovernmental transfer agreement, these funds are split between Cook County and the State of Illinois. This
amendment provides for adjustments to the quarterly transfer payments.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal

October 23, 2013

The purpose of the amendment to this intergovernmental agreement is to allow CCHHS to reduce the first quarter
scheduled transfer back to the State General Revenue Fund (GRF) by the County by $30 million. The intention is
to help mitigate the negative financial effects of the “backlog” of CountyCare applications at the Department of
Human Services.
This amendment also reflects the increase of the third quarter scheduled transfer back to the State GRF of $30
million.
For Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2014 the first quarter payment will be reduced by $30 million from $56,200,000 to
$26,200,000, the second quarter payment will remain at $93,750,000, and the third quarter payment will be
increased by $30 million from $93,750,000 to $123,750,000.
For FFY 2015, and each annual rate period thereafter, the quarterly payments will return to $56,200,000 in the
first quarter and $93,750,000 in the second and third quarters for a total of $243,700,000 per year.
This matter was approved by the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Finance Committee on October 11,
2013. Approval of the CCHHS Finance Committee meeting minutes is expected at the October 25, 2013 CCHHS
Board meeting.

86 acres of land and is located just north of the Village of Dolton and south of the Little Calumet River in Cook
County Board of Commissioners District #5.
According to a letter of advice from the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, this property should be removed
from Hyde Park Township in addition to its disconnection from the City of Chicago.
For county administration purposes, however, this property must fall within the boundaries of a suburban
township. Pursuant to 60 ILCS 1/10-5(i), the Cook County Board is expressly authorized to alter the boundaries
of townships. Thornton Township, which adjoins the property, is the best choice to annex this property.
It is recommended that, for tax year 2013, the following property be annexed into Thornton Township:
“That part lying South and West of the Little Calumet River in the South half of Section 35 Township 27 North
Range 14 East of the Third Principal Meridian in Cook County, Illinois.”

(2)

Post-booking diversion. This category of diversion may be sought by the State's Attorney for
mentally ill and/or substance abuse detainees/arrestees who are detained for crimes that constitute
Class A misdemeanors and Class 4 felonies and which are nonviolent. The State's Attorney may
seek a pre-arraignment investigation which may include, but need not be limited to, assessment
by a mental health and substance abuse service provider to determine whether the suspect is
eligible for diversion. If a diversion plan is agreed upon by all parties involved, it may include a
requirement that the diverted detainee adhere to an individualized treatment and service plan
developed by an appropriate clinician, provision for restitution with respect to injuries or property
damage caused by the diverted detainee and y identify a case manager who shall monitor the
diverted detainee's compliance with the diversion plan and report on such compliance as required
in the diversion plan.

(3)

Pre-trial diversion to special courts. This level shall continue to emphasize proper assessment and
speedy trials for those detainees who have been diagnosed by the appropriate clinicians as being
mentally ill having a mental illness or with substance abuse disorders. If a detainee has been
diagnosed as being mentally ill having a mental illness or diagnosed with substance abuse
disorders and is held over for trial the detainee shall have immediate access to the appropriate
treatment services. The case should be referred to the appropriate specialty courts for a speedy
trial. This category of diversion is subject to the approval of the court.

(4)

Post-adjudication diversion.

cases where a person has also been found, by a licensed clinician, as being mentally ill
having a mental illness and suffering with substance abuse and it has been agreed upon
on by the courts that a diversion plan may be developed, that person shall be eligible for
immediate treatment.

b.

This category of diversion consists of dispositions in the Juvenile Court and the
