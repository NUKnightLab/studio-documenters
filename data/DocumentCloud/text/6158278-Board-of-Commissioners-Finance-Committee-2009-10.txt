corporate limits or unincorporated areas; and
WHEREAS, states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina have
abandoned experiments with the legalization of video poker because of regulatory
difficulties, corruption, and the high social costs associated with this form of
gambling; and

adverse impacts on residents of Cook County including the potential for corruption,

with our desire to maintain a family friendly environment for citizens and their
