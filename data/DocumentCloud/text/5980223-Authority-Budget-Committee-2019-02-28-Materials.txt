 12/13/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 3

I. Minutes of the October 18, 2018, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the minutes of the October 18, 2018, Budget
Committee Meeting. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.
Ms. Kramer said that the last paragraph on Page 4 of the minutes should read (correction
in italics):
“ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt referred the Budget Committee
members to a memo located at Page 19 of the meeting materials…”
Vote: The motion, including the correction, passed by unanimous voice vote.
II. Community - Law Enforcement Partnership for Deflection and Substance Abuse
Treatment (CLEP)
ICJIA Program Specialist Lajuana Murphy said that at a previous Budget Committee
meeting, the committee approved a Community - Law Enforcement Partnership for
Deflection and Substance Abuse Treatment (CLEP) Notice of Funding Opportunity
(NOFO). She said the funding opportunity was designed to authorize law enforcement to
develop and implement a deflection program that offers an immediate pathway to
substance use treatment as an alternative to involvement in the criminal justice system.
She said eight applications were received and six applicants were recommended for
designations. She said staff recommended designating a total of $420,573 to the entities.

Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended SFY19 CLEP designations. Mr.
Olson seconded the motion. Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

V. FFY15 Victims Assistance Discretionary Grant Training Program
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt said ICJIA received a FFY15 Victims
Assistance Discretionary Grant Training Program (VADGT) from the U.S. Office for
Victims of Crime (OVC) for the purpose of training Victims of Crime Act (VOCA)
grantee staff. He said OVC created VADGT to assist states with training costs. He
described $40,612 in final lapsed funds from VADGT grant programs as the FFY15
VADGT award is being closed out and staff recommended reducing the program
designations.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY15 VADGT designation
reductions. Ms. Kramer seconded the motion. Vote: The motion passed with a recusal by
Ms. Hora.

 12/13/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 4

III. FFY18 Victims of Crime Act Discretionary Training and Technical Assistance
Grant
Mr. Reichgelt said the FFY18 Victims of Crime Act Discretionary Training and
Technical Assistance Grant (DTTA) will support programs that had been supported by
the now-defunct VADGT program plus training for Child Advocacy Centers of Illinois
staff. He said that in addition to the $316,667 in recommended FFY18 DTTA
designations, ICJIA would retain some DTTA funds to hire a contractual training
coordinator to allow ICJIA to conduct additional trainings for victim groups and sponsor
conferences.
Motion: Chief Perez moved to approve the recommended FFY18 DTTA designations.
Ms. Wolff seconded the motion. Vote: The motion passed with a recusal by Ms. Hora.
VII. Victims of Crime Act Plan Adjustments
Mr. Reichgelt referred to the memo at Page 53 of the meeting materials and regarding the
Victims of Crime Act VOCA plan adjustments.
A. Designation Reductions
Mr. Reichgelt described the recommended FFY15 and FFY16 designation reductions as
presented on pages 1 and 2 of the memo. He said that many of the transitional housing
program grantees were delayed in starting, resulting in lapsed funds. He said that
restrictions imposed by the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act have made it
difficult to get new programs up and running in a relatively short time period and that,
going forward, larger fund lapses could become normal.
Motion: Mr. Olson moved to approve the recommended FFY15 and FFY16 designation
reductions. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion. Vote: The motion passed by unanimous
voice vote.
B. Recommended Designations
1. Victims of Crime Act: CASA Victim Assistance
Mr. Reichgelt said staff recommended using $1,106,973 in VOCA FFY16 funds to
increase existing designations to Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Victim
Assistance programs, as described in the table at the bottom of page 2 of the memo. This
will allow these programs to continue until June 30, 2019. He said that the recommended
increases appear to be inconsistent across the board because they are based on the
grantees’ anticipated expenditures through June 30, 2019, and the amounts vary
depending on how much of their existing designations they have already spent.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY16 CASA Victim
Assistance program designation increases. Ms. Kramer seconded the motion.

5

 12/13/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 5

Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
2. Victims of Crime Act: Law Enforcement, Prosecution Victim Assistance
Mr. Reichgelt said staff recommended using $1,344,829 in VOCA FFY16 funds to
increase existing designations to Law Enforcement, Prosecution Victim Assistance
programs by the amounts described in the table at the top of page 3 of the memo so that
these programs could continue until June 30, 2019. He said that the recommended
increases appear to be inconsistent across the board because they are based on the
grantees’ anticipated expenditures through June 30, 2019, and the amounts vary
depending on how much of their existing designations they have already spent.
He said an evaluation of the law enforcement component of the program is under way.
Ms. Hora said that she would like to review the notices of funding opportunities for these
programs as they pertain to state’s attorney’s offices because so few submitted qualifying
applications.
Motion: Chief Perez moved to approve the recommended FFY16 Law Enforcement,
Prosecution Victim Assistance program designation increases. Ms. Wolff seconded the
motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote with a recusal by Ms. Kramer due to
her involvement with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.
3. Residential Treatment for Justice-Involved Girls
Mr. Reichgelt said that staff recommends designating $844,268 in FFY17 VOCA funds
to Maryville Academy to implement an intensive residential treatment program for girls
ages 14 through 18 who are in the custody of the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice
and have histories of trauma and abuse.
Sr. Ryan introduced members of the Maryville Academy staff and described the
Maryville Academy and the proposed program.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY17 Residential Treatment
for Justice-Involved Girls program designation. Ms. Kramer seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
IV. FFY18 Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act Plan
Introduction
Mr. Stevens, referring to the memo at Page 30 of the meeting materials and regarding the
FFY18 Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act (NFSIA) Plan

6

 12/13/18 Budget Committee Meeting Minutes, Page 6

Introduction, said the FFY18 award to ICJIA is $759,283, almost twice as much as the
FFY17 award of $307,162.
Mr. Stevens said that new NFSIA programming guidelines require grantees to address the
opioid crisis. He described $759,283 in FFY18 funds recommended for designations to
entities as described in the table in the memo.
Motion: Chief Perez moved to approve the recommended FFY18 NFSIA program
designations. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
VI. Violence Against Women Act Plan Adjustments
Ms. Hailey referred to a memo on page 40 of the meeting materials on Violence Against
Women Act (VAWA) Plan Adjustments.
A. Designation Reductions
ICJIA Program Supervisor Shataun Hailey described $282 in FFY12, $8,226 in FFY13,
$98,887 in FFY15, and $23,413 in FFY16 funds recently returned to ICJIA. She said
FFY15 funds expired on June 30, 2018, and were no longer available for use. She said
staff recommended making the returned FFY15 and FFY16 funds available for future
programming.
Motion: Mr. Kocerka moved to approve the recommended FFY12, FFY13, FFY15, and
FFY16 VAWA program designation reductions. Mr. Olson seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote with a recusal by Ms. Kramer.
B. New Designations
Ms. Hailey said that ICJIA had convened an Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee to
review past priorities and define new ones for the use of FFY17-FFY20 VAWA STOP
VAWA funds. Multi-disciplinary team response programs were identified as a funding
priority at that time, she said. She said in August 2018, a notice of funding opportunity
was issued to all existing MDT program grantees for continuation grants. She said all
applied and all were approved. She said staff recommended $121,485 in FFY15,
$643,342 in FFY16, $1,926,392 in FFY17, and $558,211 in FFY18 funds be designated
to VAWA MDT programs as described in the table on pages 2 and 3 of the memo.
Ms. Hora requested that future VAWA memos include descriptions of remaining funds
and their distributions among the five VAWA program categories.
Motion: Chief Perez moved to approve the recommended FFY15, FFY16, FFY17 and
FFY18 VAWA program designations. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.

This memo describes Bullying Prevention Fund plan adjustments for state fiscal year 2019 funds.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Trauma Aware Schools
The Trauma Aware Schools program design consists of an assessment and planning period to be
completed by June 30, 2019. Developed by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network’s
Treatment and Services Adaptation Center for Resilience, Hope, and Wellness in Schools and
the Center for School Mental Health, the Trauma Responsive Schools Implementation
Assessment (TRS-IA) provides a comprehensive assessment that can also be used by schools to
document immediate and long-term changes. Grantees will assist schools in completing the
assessment and developing an action plan with immediate and longer-term projects. Grantees
may select to include additional tools in their assessment process. The action plan is due July 15,
2019, and must be approved by ICJIA by August 1, 2019. Contingent on satisfactory
performance, future appropriation, and approval of the action plan, grantees may receive
continuation funding for implementation of the action plan resulting from this notice.

See p. 3

Funding Source:

Trauma Aware Schools / SFY19 Bullying Prevention

Agency Budget:

See p. 4

Request Type:

NOFO #1704-960

A Trauma Aware Schools Planning Grants Notice of Funding Opportunity was posted on January 15, 2019. The
program design requires at least five years’ experience providing training and technical assistance to schools on
bullying prevention, social and emotional learning, and/or trauma-aware climate initiatives. ICJIA assessed
agencies with the experience and capacity to meet the program design and requirements in a short time frame.
Based on that criteria, the following entities were eligible to apply:
 Center for Rural Health at Southern Illinois University
 Center for Childhood Resilience at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago
Program Description
Bullying is defined as unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The
behavior can be verbal, physical, or social and occurs more than once or has the potential to be repeated over
time (stopbullying.gov). In a national study, 21 percent of Illinois high school students stated they had been
bullied on school property and 17 percent stated they had been electronically bullied (Center for Disease
Control, 2017).
Bullying prevention research has shown that programs must address school climate and culture in addition to
specific bullying behaviors (Child Safety Network August 8, 2018 webinar). Evidence-informed programs
include school-wide culture components such as training, awareness, monitoring, and assessment of bullying
and consistent modeling from staff. Addressing school climate is consistent with Positive Behavior Intervention
Supports used throughout Illinois schools, Social and Emotional Learning standards adopted by the Illinois
State Board of Education (Section 15(a) of Public Act 93-0495), and general violence prevention frameworks.
These approaches are synergistic with the emerging work to develop trauma informed schools. The National
Child Traumatic Stress Network suggests that the Multi-Tiered System of Support Model is an appropriate
framework to infuse trauma-informed concepts and practices. This model also emphasizes engaging families
and incorporates the wider context including the school environment/culture and the larger community
(National Child Traumatic Stress Network, Schools Committee, 2017). Tier One is foundational and directed to
all students, teachers, and staff and creates an “environment with clear expectations for everyone, open
communication, and a collective commitment to a safe and nurturing school culture” (National Child Traumatic
Stress Network, Schools Committee, 2017). Tier Two is directed at students who are at risk and can receive
supports in small groups. Tier Three includes intensive supports for students whose behavior and experiences

require clinical interventions. All three tiers require unique training and skill development that are necessary for
complete implementation.
Program Activities
The Trauma Aware Schools program design consists of an assessment and planning period to be completed by
June 30, 2019. Developed by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network’s Treatment and Services
Adaptation Center for Resilience, Hope, and Wellness in Schools and the Center for School Mental Health, the
Trauma Responsive Schools Implementation Assessment (TRS-IA) provides a comprehensive assessment that
can also be used by schools to document immediate and long-term changes. Grantees will assist schools in
completing the assessment and developing an action plan with immediate and longer-term projects. Grantees
may select to include additional tools in their assessment process. The action plan is due July 15, 2019, and
must be approved by ICJIA by August 1, 2019. Contingent on satisfactory performance, future appropriation,
and approval of the action plan, grantees may receive continuation funding for implementation of the action
plan resulting from this notice.
Center for Rural Health at Southern Illinois University will provide programming in Franklin, Saline, and
Williamson counties. Center for Childhood Resilience at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago
will provide programming in five to 10 schools in Chicago’s Englewood, North Lawndale, and/or South
Lawndale neighborhoods.

SFY19 Death Penalty Abolition Fund
_____

This memo describes Death Penalty Abolition Fund plan adjustments for state fiscal year 2019
funds.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
Services to Families of Homicide Victims
Public Act 725 ILCS 5/119(b) directed the transfer of all unobligated and unexpended monies
remaining in the Capital Litigation Trust Fund to the Death Penalty Abolition (DPA) Fund, a
special fund in the state treasury, to be expended by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information
Authority. These funds shall be used for services for families of victims of homicide or murder,
and for training of law enforcement personnel.
In January, $2.5 million in DPA state fiscal year 2019 funds were made available through a
notice of funding opportunity for services to families of homicide victims. Twelve proposals
were received. Of that number, eleven met all of the proposal criteria and were reviewed by
teams of ICJIA staff. A minimum average score of 75 was required for funding recommendation.
Staff recommends designating SFY19 DPA funds to the following entities.

SUBJECT:

SFY19 Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council

ILLINOIS FAMILY VIOLENCE COORDINATING COUNCILS
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council (IFVCC) comprises 13 local family
violence coordinating councils that offer local forums to share and discuss information
promoting a coordinated response to family violence in communities. Annually, up to
15,000 professionals from across Illinois participate in trainings and council projects.
These include family violence training and education of criminal justice and community
professionals; development of criminal justice procedures, protocols, and services related
to family violence; and the facilitation of coordinated community response to family
violence in local areas. These Local Councils provide opportunities for communication
between criminal justice professionals and community service providers as well as
encourage the sharing of information and resources, thereby providing for development
of a network of safety and assistance for family violence victims.
Funds are used to support a part-time local council coordinator for each council and
coordination of committee work, training, travel, and other related activities as
determined by the Local Council Planning/Steering Committees. The Planning/Steering
Committee and local council coordinator establish the goals and objectives for the
upcoming year. All local council activities are approved by the Illinois Family Violence
Coordinating Council.
Recommended Designation Reduction
Staff recommends decreasing the existing Cra Wa La Volunteers in Probation, Inc.
designation by $10,000. The 4th Judicial Circuit Family Violence Coordinating Council
was unable to hire a local council coordinator in the first two quarters of the grant period;
therefore, the funds will not be needed. The $10,000 will go to administrative use for the
Annual IFVCC Spring Training.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS

Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics
On July 27, 2017, the Budget Committee approved the use of $4,096,245 in FFY13,
FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 JAG funds to support police-led substance use
diversion/deflection programs, multijurisdictional large-scale narcotic trafficking
enforcement, and multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution programs. These funds
supported the first year of a potential three years of programming to the agencies. These
grant agreements ended September 30, 2018.
Because the U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance delayed receipt of Illinois’s Federal Fiscal
Year 2017 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) award, JAG funds to
continue the Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics programs have
been limited.

To maximize the use of JAG funds available and to sustain the programs, the Budget
Committee made six-month designations to programs listed in the following table,
allowing them to continue. Now that ICJIA is in receipt of the FFY17 JAG award, staff
recommends designating funds as described in the table. These designations will support
the programs for 18 months, except where noted, fulfilling ICJIA’s three-year
commitment to fund these programs. These amounts represent only essential program
costs.

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1406-263: Comprehensive Law
Enforcement Response to Drugs: Year 2 of 3

Program Description
Law enforcement agencies have recognized that arrest and prosecution of low level drug users does not enhance
community safety or effectively reduce demand as those with substance use disorders repeatedly cycle through
the criminal justice system without treatment. In response, law enforcement agencies have crafted new models
to reduce demand by deflecting drug users from involvement in the criminal justice to meaningful treatment and
to divert individuals arrested for low-level offenses from prosecution to treatment. The three programs
recommended for funding are built on partnerships with community health care, substance abuse treatment
resources, and prosecutors that link drug users with the opportunity for treatment rather than incarceration.
Program Activities
Naperville Police Department: Connect for Life is a deflection program that involves getting those struggling
with opiate addiction the help they need. The funding will allow the department to divert drug-involved
individuals away from criminal justice involvement and into community-based clinical intervention. In addition,
funding will be used continue to promote and market the program in surrounding communities to build
awareness and increase connections. The program serves the City of Naperville and residents of surrounding
towns.
Dixon Police Department: The Safe Passage Initiative is a police deflection program designed to help get heroin
and other opioid users into recovery from addiction. The funding will be used to train and sustain recovery
coaches who develop a coordinated system of care to ensure individuals who voluntarily seek treatment for their
substance use disorder receive the services they need. The program serves Lee and Whiteside counties.

Braidwood Police Department: Communities Helping Addicts Needing to Gain Empowerment (C.H.A.N.G.E.)
is a deflection program that serves as a point of contact for individuals seeking treatment for their addiction to
opiates. It provides a public health approach to substance use disorder, addressing it as a disease that needs
medical care and not incarceration. The funding will provide transportation for C.H.A.N.G.E. program clients to
and from the needed services identified in individual assessments, including detox facilities, in-patient treatment
centers, individual counseling, recovery support groups, and methadone treatment center. This helps individuals
avoid entry/re-entry into the criminal justice system. The program serves the City of Braidwood, southern Will
County and eastern Grundy County.
Goal
To increase public safety and reduce the large social and economic cost of narcotics use by supporting
specialized enforcement and prosecution of drug traffickers and the use of treatment over incarceration for
individuals arrested for low-level offenses
Priorities
The recommended programs address the following JAG Goals/Priority for Drug Enforcement and Treatment
Programs:
To support research-informed and promising drug enforcement and treatment efforts by providing resources to
programs that break the cycle of system involvement in the criminal justice system for people who abuse legal
and illegal drugs and substances, that ensure the safety of the crime victim and the public, and that promote the
payment of restitution to crime victims and to support evidence based programs that enhance public safety and
reduce the amount of drugs and substances illegally manufactured and distributed.
Funding Prospectus
This funding provides 18 months of funding to a program awarded via a competitive notice of funding
opportunity.

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1406-263: Comprehensive Law
Enforcement Response to Drugs: Year 2 of 3

Program Description
To combat drug trafficking, states use multijurisdictional drug task forces made up of law enforcement officers
from state, county, and local police departments to pool resources and more efficiently and effectively combat
drug distribution in multiple jurisdictions (Mazerolle, Soole, & Rombouts, 2007). Outcome evaluations reveal
multijurisdictional drug task forces are more effective at making serious drug arrests than traditional law
enforcement (Olson et al., 2002; McGarrell & Schlegel, 1993; Schlegel & McGarrell, 1991; and Myrent, 2013).
The following graph depicts drug arrests by the type of drug offense–drug possession and
manufacture/delivery–in the counties covered by 19 multijurisdictional drug task forces during 2013.
Multijurisdictional drug task forces made proportionately more drug delivery arrest than traditional law
enforcement in the same counties, at 53 percent and 14 percent, respectively, and proportionally fewer drug
possession arrests, at 44 percent and 69 percent, respectively.

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1406-263: Comprehensive Law
Enforcement Response to Drugs: Final 18 Months

Program Description
Multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution units increase public safety and reduce the large social and economic
cost of drug use through specialized enforcement and prosecution of drug traffickers and the use of treatment
over incarceration for low-level offenders.
Program Activities
Drug prosecution units were designed to address the complexities of prosecuting drug trafficking crimes. For
example, in drug trafficking cases, the prosecution needs strong evidence proving the involvement in a single
enterprise to distribute drugs, as well as an understanding the drug trafficking organization, its day-to-day
operations, and links to organized crime and overseas suppliers (Natarajan, 2006). These drugs units work with
law enforcement officers to provide prosecutorial oversight to those cases so that the evidence will withstand
legal challenges and lead to a successful prosecution. While there is not enough research to draw conclusions on
specialized drug prosecution units, research examining other specialized prosecution units have shown these
units reduce the likelihood of case rejection (Pyrooz, Wolfe, & Spohn, 2011).
Goals
To fund state’s attorneys’ prosecution services throughout Illinois in drug-related criminal cases and in drugrelated civil asset forfeiture cases. This comes with the intention of increasing public safety and reducing the
large social and economic cost of narcotics use through specialized prosecution of drug traffickers.
Priorities
The recommended programs address the following JAG Goals/Priority for Prosecution, Court Programs, and
Indigent Defense:
Goal: To support all public prosecutors, including appellate prosecutors, by providing the resources and
training necessary to assist them in protecting public safety by holding offenders accountable while ensuring
the constitutional rights of the accused and enforcing crime victims’ constitutional and statutory rights.

RE:

FFY14 Violence Against Women Act Plan Adjustment

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
The S.T.O.P. Violence Against Women Act Formula Grant Program (VAWA) enhances
the capacity of local communities to develop and strengthen effective law enforcement
and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes against women and to develop and
strengthen victim services in cases involving violent crimes against women.
The FFY17 VAWA award to Illinois was $5,160,091 and the FFY14 award was
$4,960,602. Both have an expiration date of June 30, 2019.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATION
Historically, the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) has received half of
every VAWA federal fiscal year award’s allocation of service provider category funds
via a 15-month agreement to provide continued support for its Services for Underserved
Areas or Victim Groups Program. ICASA then distributes these funds via subcontracts to
their program partner agencies. The 15-month agreement performance periods include 12
months of funding for programming activities and three months to allow ICASA to
administratively close out the agreements that it made with its partner agencies.
On February 28, 2018, the Budget Committee designated $696,613 in FFY17 funds to
ICASA to continue its Services for Underserved Areas or Victim Groups Program for the
period of February 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019, with a close-out period running until
April 30, 2019.
Staff recommends designating $290,000 in FFY14 funds to ICASA to support the
Services for Underserved Areas or Victim Groups Program for an additional five months,
extending the current grant program funding period through June 30, 2019.

This funding extension will allow ICASA to continue to support its Services for
Underserved Areas or Victim Groups Program without interruption until the start of the
performance period of its next continuation grant, which is expected to be July 1, 2019.
The July 1, 2019, start date and period of performance will then be consistent with the
start dates of the other lead entity agreements, making the grant more manageable for
ICJIA staff.

Program Description
In 2017, the ICJIA Ad Hoc Victim Service Committee recommended using FFY17 – FFY20 Violence Against
Women Act (VAWA) funds to continue to support programs previously funded through VAWA. Illinois
Coalition Against Sexual Assault will use FFY14 and FFY17 VAWA funds in this grant to support the
continuation of 14 satellite offices of sexual assault programs and core services in two developing sexual assault
crisis centers. ICASA has used VAWA funds to support these satellite programs since FFY96 to broaden the
availability of sexual assault crisis services throughout the state. The satellite offices and new rape crisis centers
are located in previously unserved geographical areas or underserved neighborhoods.
Program Activities
Services provided by satellite programs include a minimum of a 24-hour hotline and 24-hour access to
individual medical and criminal justice advocacy. Additionally, the satellite offices provide ongoing counseling,
professional training, prevention services, institutional advocacy and information and referral.
Goals
Goals include developing, broadening, or strengthening victim services programs, including sexual assault,
domestic violence, and dating violence programs, developing or improving delivery of victim services to
underserved populations, providing specialized domestic violence court advocates in courts where a significant
number of protection orders are granted, and increasing reporting and reducing attrition rates for cases involving
violent crimes against women, including crimes of sexual assault and domestic violence.
Priorities
In 2017, ICJIA convened the Ad Hoc Victim Service Committee to review past priorities and define new ones
for the use of S.T.O.P. VAWA funds. The committee recommended using FFY17 – FFY20 VAWA funds to
continue to support programs previously funded through VAWA. The designations recommended in this memo
are consistent with the priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY17 – FFY20 Multi-Year Plan.
