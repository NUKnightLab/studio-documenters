subdivision or by any one under contract for public works," approved June 26, 1941, codified as
amended, 820 ILCS 130/1 et seq. (1993), formerly Ill. Rev. Stat., Ch. 48, par. 39s- l et seq.; and

general prevailing rate of wages in this locality for laborers, mechanics and other workers engaged in the
construction of public works coming under the jurisdiction of this County is hereby ascertained to be the
same as the prevailing rate of wages for construction work in the Cook County area as determined by the
Department of Labor of the State of Illinois as of June 2002, a copy of that determination being attached
hereto and incorporated herein by reference. As required by said Act, any and all revisions of the
prevailing rate of wages by the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois shall supersede the
Department's June determination and apply to any and all public works construction undertaken by the
County of Cook. The Definition of any terms appearing in this Ordinance which are also used in
aforesaid Act shall be the same as in said Act.
Section 2. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply said general prevai ling rate of wages as
herein ascertained to any work or employment except public works construction of this County to the
extent required by the aforesaid Act.
Section 3. The Bureau of Human Resources shall publicly post or keep available fo r inspection by any

Section 5. The Bureau of Human Resources shall promptly file a certified copy of this Ordinance with
both the Secretary of State Index Division and the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois.
Section 6. The Bureau of Human Resources shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general
c irculation within the area a copy of this Ordinance, and such publication shall constitute notice that the
determination is effective and that this is the detennination of this public body.
Section 7. The Purchasing Agent of Cook County shall specify in the call for bids in any contract for
public works that the general prevailing rate of wages in the locality for each craft or type of laborer or

WHEREAS, a report by the National Institute of Justice, November 2000, cited that in the United States
there is virtually no systematic, comprehensive approach to reintegrating ex-offenders into our
communities. This year more than 600,000 of the 2 million people incarcerated in state and federal
institutions will leave prison and return to neighborhoods across the country. Most of the neighborhoods
to which these ex-felons will return are low income and minority communities; and
WHEREAS, while 5% of the world' s population lives in the United States, 25% of the world's prison
population is in United States jails and prisons. Here, the poor and people of color are more likely to be
incarcerated, 66% of the nations' prison population are persons of color, 53% of inmates earned less than
$I 0,000 a year prior to incarceration, 13% were homeless before their imprisonment, and 34% lost their
homes because of their sentencing; and

2252

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR J UNE 18, 2002

WHEREAS, the median educational level of released prisoners is 11th grade, and 3/4 of re-entering
prisoners have a history of substance abuse. Another 16% s uffer from some form of mental illness.
There is a shortage of vocational, educational, substance abuse, and mental health programs in prison.
More than l 00,000 prisoners who have received no services in prison are being released each year
without any form of community correctional supervision or life skills assistance. 62% of those released
from state prisons will be rearrested within 3 years and 40% will be incarcerated, many for technical
violations of parole; and
WHEREAS, neighborhoods across the nation are absorbing the economic and social costs of reintegrating
hundreds of thousands of ex-offenders into society each year. ln 1996, the Justice Department reported
that the cost of crime to victims is about $450 billion a year, or $ 1,800 per man, woman and chi ld. In
order to prevent a rise in the cost to the public and the emotional, spiritual and economic cost of reincarceration to the ex-offender, these men and women need comprehensive re-entry solutions; and
WHEREAS, one of the l st steps in he lping the ex-offender is finding a satisfactory place for him or her to
live upon re lease. Re-entry problems include a lack of access to mainstream independent housing
accommodations. The flea bag hotels and homeless she lters that are usually the only choices avai lable
create a social environment that is like ly to lead to re-offending. Thi s legislation would address a
fundamental need by creating a stable living environment for the ex-offenders struggling to re-enter our
communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Board of
Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby support the
passage of the Public Safety Ex-Offender Self Sufficiency Act of2002, which proposes to amend the IRS
Code of 1986 to reflect a 2 year ex-offender low-income housing credit to encourage the providing of
housing, job training and other essential services to federal and state ex-felons through a structured living
environment designed to assist the ex-offender in becoming self-sufficient; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resoluti on be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body, and that a copy of same be tendered to the Honorable Danny K.
Davis in s upport of the Public Safety Ex-Offender Self Sufficiency Act of 2002.
