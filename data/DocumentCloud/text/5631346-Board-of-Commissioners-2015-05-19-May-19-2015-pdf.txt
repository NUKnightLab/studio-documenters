The resolution for Item 1 approves acceptance of a grant award and approval of an
Intergovernmental Agreement with the Chicago Department of Family and Support Services
(DFSS) in the amount of $1,158,300 for the Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP). The
resolution also approves an increase in the Resident Services budget in order to amend contracts
with CHA’s current FamilyWorks providers in an additional aggregate amount not-to-exceed
$300,000 to implement and administer the Summer Youth Employment Program. The intention
of SYEP is to provide Chicago youth and young adults with safe, meaningful summer
experiences, while learning valuable and transferable skills that connect life lessons and
academic preparation, ultimately enhancing participants’ long-term employment prospects.
Participants receive ongoing job readiness instruction and career exploration integrated with a
paid employment placement for 6 weeks. FamilyWorks providers match CHA youth with
employers throughout Chicago, based on youth interest. CHA participates in the One Summer
Chicago initiative, which is a collaborative effort between the City of Chicago, Cook County and
the civic and business communities, to provide summer programming for CHA youth. As a
partner in One Summer Chicago, CHA will be providing paid academic enhancement and
workforce development opportunities to 3,000 CHA youth in 2015. For the past three years, as
part of the One Summer Chicago initiative, CHA has collaborated with DFSS to provide paid
summer opportunities to CHA youth through the SYEP program.

 Ayes:

Matthew Brewer
Mark Cozzi
Dr. Mildred Harris
Harriet Johnson
Jack Markowski
Bridget Reidy
Z. Scott
Rodrigo Sierra

Nays:

None

There being no questions or discussion, Chairwoman Scott thereupon declared said Motion
carried and said resolutions adopted.
Committee Jack Markowski, then presented the report for the Operations and Facilities
Committee meeting. Per Commissioner Markowski, the Operations and Facilities committee
met on Wednesday, May 13, 2015 at the CHA Corporate Offices, 12th Floor Loft in Chicago.
Commissioner Markowski chaired the meeting and the following Commissioners were also
present: Commissioners Harris and Washington. Present also, but not counted for the quorum,
were Commissioners Johnson and Brewer. After presentation by staff, committee members
discussed and voted on the two items appearing on the agenda.
On behalf of the Operations & Facilities Committee, Commissioner Markowski then presented
an Omnibus Motion for the approval of Items 4 and 5.
(Item 4)
The resolution for Item 4 approves a two-year extension option with Constellation Energy Services,
Inc. for the supply and delivery of electricity to various CHA residential sites and facilities in an
amount not-to-exceed $6,632,320. The Electricity Supply and Delivery Agreement offers CHA the
opportunity to purchase its electrical needs at wholesale instead of retail, and enables the CHA to hedge
against potential market price fluctuations through use of multi-tiered price/risk management options.
The CHA is planning to utilize this contractual capability and current low pricing in the energy market
to lock in favorable electricity rates for two-one year periods in an effort to decrease CHA’s exposure to
market volatility. Market indicators suggest that the current electricity commodity rates are expected
to increase in the next two years. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the CHA to present an extension
option for two-one year periods before the current base term of the contact is complete. The CHA
continues to utilize Com Ed for the distribution of electricity from the Chicago’s central delivery gate to
actual CHA buildings. The associated local distribution costs are not included within the scope or
budget of this contract and will continue to be billed separately.
Commissioner Bridget Reidy recused from voting on Item 4.

WHEREAS,

the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the

TWO ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTIONS WITH CONSTELLATION ENERGY
SERVICES, INC. (AS SUCCESSOR TO INTEGRYS ENERGY SERVICES, INC.)

RESIDENTIAL SITES AND FACILITIES”

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
execute a contract amendment exercising both the first and second options reserved
under Contract #11319 with Constellation Energy Services, Inc. (as the successor to
Integrys Energy Services, Inc., pursuant to a merger) for the period from August 1, 2015
through July 31, 2017 to purchase electricity supply and delivery services and to
increase the existing not to exceed compensation amount under Contract #11319 by an
amount not to exceed $6,632,320, resulting in a new aggregate compensation in an
amount not to exceed $15,332,320.

 (Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 authorizes staff to proceed with the application process for an additional 13
properties under Phase 1 of CHA’s Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program portfolio
application to HUD. These additional properties serve, in part, as a contingency plan for original Phase
1 properties that may not move forward in accordance with Phase 1 programmatic deadlines. In 2012,
Congress authorized the RAD program. RAD provides an opportunity for housing authorities to
utilize either project-based voucher or project-based rental assistance contracts to stabilize funding for
up to 185,000 units of public housing. A primary goal of RAD is to use long-term contracts to
leverage private financing for capital improvements while preserving affordability. CHA submitted a
portfolio application to HUD on October 24, 2013, to transition 10,935 units within two phases under
the RAD program. CHA anticipates an award will be issued soon. Once an award is issued, CHA will
be required to achieve certain programmatic milestones within specified deadlines. In the event there
are properties within Phase 1 that cannot meet the deadlines associated with the RAD award, CHA has
identified 13 properties originally reserved for Phase 2 that may move up in queue either as additional
Phase 1 properties or as substitutions.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-40
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed
the Board letter dated May 13, 2015 requesting authorization to proceed with
the application process for 13 properties within Phase 1 of CHA’s RAD
portfolio application.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes CHA staff to proceed with the
application and substitution process for Phase 1 of CHA’s RAD application, as
needed or required.
