Summary: The Bureau of Technology requests approval of two amendments to Contract no.
1390-12899 with Oracle America, Inc. to 1) exercise the County’s Universal License Agreement
(“ULA”) expansion option, and 2) add Oracle’s Talent Software and Hosting Services to the product pool
of the County’s agreement.
The ULA is a component of the overarching Contract that allows the County to establish its license
consumption levels before entering maintenance mode. Because the County is currently implementing
multiple large Oracle-based projects with varying go-live dates through 2020, such as Enterprise
Resource Planning, Integrated Property, and the Enterprise Service Bus, it is important that the County

 exercises its ULA expansion option in order to accommodate the license consumption required by these
projects in the coming years.
The Oracle Talent Software and Hosting Services element represent the products purchased by Oracle
from Taleo Corporation, which the County previously purchased from Taleo Corporation under Contract
No. 09-41-351 in 2009 to provide automated recruiting, hiring, and onboarding for the County, Health
and Hospital System, Separately Elected Officials and Forest Preserve District.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Oracle America, Inc. was awarded this contract based on established
evaluation criteria.
