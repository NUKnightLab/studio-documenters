ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT (continued)
Legislative Matters
Mr. Walsh discussed the requirement under P.A. 100-0023 (the “Act”) to hire an independent actuary in order to
calculate the “Tier 3” normal cost as a percentage of pay. As prescribed by the Act, this figure is to be used to
determine the contributions of those employees subject to the “Tier 3” benefit structure. Mr. Walsh referred the
Trustees to a letter from Trustee Brown (Chief Financial Officer, City of Chicago) which contained the City’s request
to engage Aon Consultants (“Aon”) for this purpose (see attached).
The Trustees discussed the matter at length. Mr. Walsh expressed that he would be comfortable utilizing Aon in this
limited capacity, but did want the opportunity to have a discussion with Aon regarding their methodology and
assumptions prior to engaging them. Trustee Brown conveyed the City’s interest in leveraging their current contract
with Aon. Mr. Walsh expressed his desire that the Fund enter into a contractual arrangement with Aon as well in
order to ensure that the Fund and its members are afforded certain legal protections. Trustee Brown suggested that
the Fund and Aon might enter into a side letter agreement for this purpose. Trustees directed Mr. Walsh to work with
the City and Aon on a side letter agreement.
It was moved by Trustee LoVerde, seconded by Trustee Capasso, to approve the City of Chicago’s selection of an
independent actuary pursuant to P.A. 100-0023 subject to signing of a side letter agreement.

Legislative Matter - Interceptor Provision
Mr. Walsh referenced an email the Fund received from its legislative consultant explaining that draft legislation
addressing the interceptor provision, prepared by the State’s Legislative Reference Bureau at the request of the Fund,
was inadvertently introduced, becoming House Bill 4224. Mr. Walsh went on to review some previous discussions
the Board had regarding this matter as well as some of the history surrounding the interceptor provision as it relates
to various pension funds in the State. In light of the fact that legislation had now already been introduced, the Trustees
decided to take no further action at this time.

LEGAL REPORT
Coveliers Matter
This item was taken out of Order. Mr. Donham informed the Board that the Illinois Supreme Court had denied Mr.
Coveliers’ Petition for Leave to Appeal and noted that this case is over for all practical purposes. Mr. Donham also
reported that the Fund will not need to seek a repayment of the annuity payments Mr. Coveliers already received as
the payments could be deducted from the balance of refund of contributions still due to Mr. Coveliers.

 The Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Policy for Retired Employees Healthcare Insurance Benefits (the “Policy”)

Statement of Purpose
The Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago (“LABF” or
“Fund”) understands the value of attracting and retaining a talented workforce. Furthermore, pursuant
to 40 ILCS 5/11-197 and Article III of LABF’s Bylaws, LABF has the ability to hire and compensate
employees as needed. Among the benefits that have historically been included in the overall
compensation package offered to LABF employees is access to group health insurance benefits upon
retirement. The purpose of this Policy is to explain the healthcare benefits currently offered to retired
LABF employees (“Fund Retirees”), specify who is eligible to participate, and set forth some important
rules regarding coverage.
Offered Benefits
Retiree health insurance benefits include medical, prescription, dental and vision coverage.
Medicare-eligible Fund Retirees must have Medicare as their primary insurer. The LABF offers a
Medicare Supplement Plan and a Medicare prescription drug plan to fill in the coverage gaps in the
standard Medicare policy. If a Medicare eligible Fund Retiree is not covered under Medicare for any
reason, the LABF will deny them coverage. Non-Medicare eligible Fund Retirees may remain on the plan
that provides medical and prescription coverage for the active employees of the Fund until such time as
they become Medicare eligible.
All persons covered under this Policy are subject to the plan administration rules and limits as
determined by the insurance company providing the coverage. Such rules and limits are subject to
change from time-to-time at the discretion of the insurer and shall not constitute a change in this Policy.
Health insurance providers can be changed by LABF at any time.
All persons covered under this Policy should refer to the Summary Plan description for coverage details.
Eligibility for Health Insurance Coverage
Eligible Fund Retirees:
To be eligible for health insurance, the Fund Retiree must (1) have been a participant in the Fund’s
active employee insurance plan immediately prior to separating from service; (2) be receiving an annuity
from LABF; and (3) elect the health insurance coverage as of the date he or she first begins collecting an
annuity from LABF. If a Fund Retiree fails to timely elect retiree health insurance coverage or drops
retiree health insurance coverage, the Fund Retiree will not be permitted to enroll or re-enroll in the
retiree health insurance plan.
Eligible Spouses:
If the Fund Retiree is enrolled in an LABF health insurance plan, a spouse is eligible for coverage if the
spouse was eligible to be covered under the LABF employee plan on the last day the Fund Retiree
worked for LABF. The eligible spouse may be added to the Fund Retiree’s policy at the time the Fund

 Retiree’s coverage begins, within 31 days of any qualifying event or during any annual open enrollment
period.
Upon the Fund Retiree’s death, if the spouse is eligible for a surviving spouse’s annuity from LABF and
was eligible to be covered on the Fund Retiree’s policy immediately prior to death, he or she may elect
or continue coverage. In the event of an active LABF employee death, a surviving spouse of the
deceased LABF employee who is eligible for a surviving spouse’s annuity from LABF and was eligible to
be covered under the LABF employee health insurance plan on the last day the active LABF employee
worked may elect or continue coverage under this policy.
Eligible Children:
The Fund Retiree’s children are eligible for coverage under the Fund Retiree’s policy or the policy of a
surviving spouse entitled to coverage after the Fund Retiree’s death if the children were eligible to be
covered on the LABF employee plan on the last day the Fund Retiree worked for LABF. The eligible child
may be added to the Fund Retiree’s or surviving spouse’s policy at the time the coverage begins, within
31 days of any qualifying event or during any annual open enrollment period.
Upon the death of both the eligible Fund Retiree and eligible surviving spouse, any child will be offered
coverage if the child is eligible for a child’s annuity from LABF and was being covered on the eligible
Fund Retiree’s or eligible surviving spouse’s policy immediately prior to death. In the event of an active
LABF employee death, a child of the deceased LABF employee who is eligible for a child’s annuity from
LABF and was eligible to be covered under the LABF employee health insurance plan on the last day the
active LABF employee worked may elect or continue coverage under this policy until age 18 or until the
child’s annuity ceases to be paid.
Eligibility for LABF Cost Sharing
With respect to any eligible Fund Retiree who retires prior to January 1, 2019, the Fund will pay 55% of
the total cost of the health insurance benefits for the retiree and/or any eligible family members who
elect to participate in the Fund’s retiree health insurance plan. Such Fund Retirees and/or any eligible
family members will pay 45% of the total cost of the coverage.
With respect to any eligible Fund Retiree who was hired prior to the effective date of this policy , the
Fund will pay 55% of the total cost of the health insurance benefits for the retiree and/or any eligible
family members who elect to participate in the Fund’s retiree health insurance plan. Such Fund Retirees
and/or any eligible family members will pay 45% of the total cost of the coverage.
With respect to any eligible Fund Retiree who was hired on or after the effective date of this policy, the
Fund will pay 0% of the total cost of the health insurance premiums for the Fund Retiree and/or any
eligible family members who elect to participate in the Fund’s retiree health insurance plan. Such Fund
Retirees and/or any eligible family members will pay 100% of the total cost of any applicable health
insurance premiums.
To be eligible for any LABF cost sharing, the Fund Retiree must have at least 5 full years of active service
as a staff member working at LABF.
AMENDING THIS POLICYTHE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LABF MAY AMEND OR DISCONTINUE THIS
POLICY AT ANY TIME, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, WITH A MINIMUM OF A 6-MONTH NOTICE TO
PARTICIPANTS.

Gentlemen:

As you may know, beginning January 1, 2018, pursuant to Public Act 100-0023 all employees
hired after July 6, 2017 are subject to, among other things, a pension deduction of the lesser of the
total normal cost or 11.5% of their payroll. The Act requires that the City, in cooperation with the
Municipal Employees Annuity and Bene?t Fund of Chicago and the Laborers Annuity and
Benefit Fund of Chicago collectively "the Funds"), engage a mutually agreed upon
independent actuary to calculate the applicable normal cost of the benefit for each Fund. That
independent calculation should then be used to confirm the appropriate pension deduction for each
Fund.

The City intends to engage Aon Consultants to undertake the independent actuarial normal
cost calculation and seeks from each Fund, as soon as practicable, your approval of this selection.
Upon receipt of your concurrence with the selection of Aon, the City will direct Aon to begin the
independent actuarial normal cost calculation for each Fund. Pursuant to the Act, the City is
responsible for the actuary?s fees and expenses, and the Funds are obligated to provide information
requested by the actuary in order to complete the calculation.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need any additional information.

Sincerely,

 

Carole L. Brown
Chief Financial Officer
