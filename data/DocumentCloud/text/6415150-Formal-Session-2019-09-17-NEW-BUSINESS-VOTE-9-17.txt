Winter in Detroit 2019-2020
City of Detroit Special Events Application

Our Ask
We are requesting to do Winter in Detroit for the 2019?2020 season. This will include a few
changes from previous years:
. More markets in Cadillac Square
0 No markets in Capitol Park
. Working with the Downtown Detroit Partnership and the Historic District Commission on
a new layout for Food and Beverage in Capitol Park that will work with new buildings and
retail opening
0 Earlier timeline due to the Forbes 30 Under 30 event wanting to utilize the tent and
market structures in Cadillac Square. They will be submitting their own application for
the event in partnership with the Downtown Detroit Partnership.

Our Why?
To activate Detroit?s downtown public spaces during a season that isn't typical for large

activations and provide local Detroit entrepreneurs opportunities to expand their businesses
without a traditional brick and mortar space.

Food and Beverage Operators
- Cadillac Square: Elia Group
0 Capitol Park: Eatori Market
Contracts will be finalized pending approval from the City of Detroit.
*Food and beverage operators are responsible for pulling their own MLCC license.

Trash and Sanitation 81 Snow Removal

Bedrock will be handling trash and sanitation in the market space, while food and beverage
operators will be responsible for their own trash and sanitation. Bedrock and the Downtown
Detroit Partnership will determine responsibilities for snow removal.

Generators and Power

Generators will be used in Cadillac Square and Capitol Park. TBD on exact numbers but
estimated 2 in Cadillac Square and 1 in Capitol Park. There will be no on?site fuel storage of
Diesel fuel, with the exception of the fuel tanks attached to the portable generators. A fuel truck
will service the generators each morning before the market opens to the public. The generator
will supply power to the vendor marketplace locations. The generator will be place in a location
where it does not hinder traffic or cause safety issues. The generator will be secured with
barricade panels to halt public access. The power cables crossing any public traffic are covered
with cable ramps.

Security and Barricades
Rock Security is partnering with DDP to determine level of coverage. At least 2 dedicated

security guards in the market place in Cadillac Square. Food and beverage operators will be
responsible for their own security.

OSC innovation which matches the
directivity patterns of the woofer and the
high-frequency waveguide at the crossover

Structural Certification Letter
Junior-T Orangerie Greenhouse
Manufactured by Janssens AluSystems in Belgium

Hollingsworth Pack has performed a structural analysis of the Junior-T Model Orangerie Greenhouse
to determine compliance with the International Building Code, which has been adopted by State
and Local governments across ail U.S. States and Territories. The Junior-T Model Orangerie is a
pre-fabricated aluminum greenhouse covered with 4mm thick tempered glass panels. A photograph
of the greenhouse can be found in the appendix of this letter.

Based upon our analysis, we have concluded that the greenhouse as currently installed by Exaco
Trading Co. Is adequate to support the following loads per the 2015 International Building Code:

Wind Load: 120 MPH (3-second gusts)
Snow Load: 35 PSF (ground-snow load)
Roof Live Load: 20 PSF

Our structural analysis and conclusions assume that the greenhouse is installed with a minimum
8"x16" tall concrete beam or solid-grouted masonry foundation continuous below the perimeter of
the greenhouse walls. The greenhouse should be anchored to the foundation with (8) mounting
brackets attached to the greenhouse frame, as specified in the Junior-T Mounting
Instructions" document to resist overturning and uplift wind forces.

If you have any questions regarding the matters addressed, or if additional information is required,
please do not hesitate to contact us. We appreciate the opportunity to be of service.

Respectfully Submitted, I.

Detroit, MI 48226

Dear Ms. Fisher,

We are making plans for the 42nd running of the Detroit Free PressiT CF Bank
Marathon. which we will hold on Sunday, October 20, 2019. We will offer a 26.2-rnile
international marathon through the streets of Detroit and Windsor. a 13.1-mile
international half marathon, a LLS. only half marathon and a ?ve-person marathon relay.
On Saturday morning, October ?19, we will once again feature a 3.1-mile 5K Run, a
Competitive 1-Mile Run and a ?l?rnite Kids Fun Run.

Last year, 25,411 participants registered to participate in these events, and over 20,300
?nished. We hope to sell out all events this year, with a cap of roughly 23,600 runners
walkers. Participants must pick up their race packets at a Health 8? Fitness Expo
which we hold at cho Center, Hall A, two days prior to the event.

Our Sunday events route remains unchanged from last year, except for a short detour in
Corktown due to planned W. Fort St construction. We are proposing a new Saturday
events course, relocating from Atwater St (Milliken State Park) to Cadillac Square. See
attached "Event Changes Summary" for details of other event changes.

Attached are the City of Detroit Special Events Application and support documents. We
have also attached a draft of this year?s course maps. turn by turn instructions, Start-
Finish Area diagrams, street closure diagrams/requests.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need additional information. Thank you
for your support. We?re looking forward to working with you once again!

Media Services Department Special Events
2 Woodward Ave, Suite 333

Detroit, MI 48226

Dear Ms. Fisher,

Please find below a synopsis of CONQUERED: The Of?cial Afterparty and CHARITY
VILLAGE, an event running concurrently with the Detroit Free Press I TCF Bank
Marathon on Sunday, October 20, 2019, between the hours of 8 am. and 2 pm.

Event location: For CONQUERED: Bedrock?s Kahn Lot at the northwest corner of Fort
Street and 3'd St. and for CHARITY VILLAGE: Bedrock?s Albert parking lot, on the
northwest comer of Lafayette and 3rd St. Both are fenced lots, with an entrance
and exits as marked on the site diagram.

Whether participants run, walk or roll - crossing the Finish Line and conquering the
Detroit Free Press I TCF Bank Marathon is a true accomplishment that should be
celebrated. In its tenth year, CONQUERED: The Of?cial Afterparty CHARITY
VILLAGE will be the place where over 10,000 event finishers, families and volunteers
will converge and celebrate.

A local live band will provide the music and vendors will have food and beer available
for purchase. Admission is free and all are welcome.

We look forward to working with the proper city departments to ensure all areas of this
marathon event are covered correctly and that all of our participants and spectators
bene?t again this year from this celebration.

Re rds,
@51le

2019 Detroit Free Press/TCF Bank Marathon
Friday, October 18, 2019 through Sunday, October 20, 2019

2019 Event Changes Summary (as of July 17)

We have changed our name once again! Our new name is
?Detroit Free Press/T CF Bank Marathon? following Chemical Bank?s acquisition of
TCF Bank last Fall.

We are moving CONQUERED: The Official Afterparty from the lot on the northwest
corner of Lafayette and 3rd St (Albert Lot) to the lot on the northwest corner of
Fort 3rd St (Kahn Lot). Our Charity Village will move to the Albert Lot

We are extending the six?foot, chain link fencing for the entire length of the start
line, for improved participant and crowd control

We will not install the pedestrian bridges over Griswold Fort Streets as in the
previous two years due to cost and timing concerns

We are starting the Disabilities Division at 6:50 AM (from 6:58 AM previously) for
improved participants? safety

We are moving the Health Fitness Expo from Hall to Hall A at Cobo Center.
We are offering a new, more participant friendly floorplan

We are introducing a Friday night participant ?meet and greet? party at the Fort
Street Galley for a nominal charge and swag bag.

Our Sunday Events marathon course remains the same with one notable
exception. We will detour around an MDOT construction site on Fort St, east of
Rosa Parks Blvd. We will make a related distance adjustment between mile 11 
mile 12 in Corktown.

We did not retain our previous event management/equipment supplier. We have
hired Phil Talbert of Total Access Events, Inc to help us secure bids and manage
our equipment, structures and permits.

We did not retain our previous private security company. We have contracted with
ProStar Professional Service Group (formerly Tricon Security) to provide This
year?s security services.

We are studying a change to the course on the east side, using Larned St instead
of Lafayette St, between Rivard and Mt Elliott. This is a request of the City?s

Detroit, MI 48226

RE: Requesting the City of Detroit to investigate the permanent closure of a
public alley in the block bounded by Beaubien, Custer, St. Antoine and Horton.

On behalf of Paradise Valley Investment Group at 560 Custer, we respectfully request
your honorable City Council authorize the closure of public alley in the block bounded
by Beaubien, Custer, St. Antoine and Horton. Due to the fact that we control our
property on both sides of the alley and for the benefit of completion of our development
project, it is in the best interest that the alley be closed in order to facilitate the
necessary parking and customer access for the new development. In order to provide a
secure, safe area for citizens and patrons it is necessary to have the permamnet
closure. The alley is not currently in for use and is essentially overgrown and only used
to house the various utilities. We do not desire to relocate any utilities nor shut off
access to the alley for the remaining residential and business interests at the Western
end. Essentially, we are requesting the closure of the Eastern end to facilitate our
development goals. Our intention is to continue access for the existing stakeholders.
