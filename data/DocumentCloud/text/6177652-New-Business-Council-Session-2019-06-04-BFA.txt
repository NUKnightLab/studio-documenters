RE: DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY FY 2019-2020 BUDGET
Dear Honorable Body:

Pursuant to Section 228(1) of Public Act 57 of 2018, we have prepared the attached FY 2019-
2020 Downtown Development Authority?s (the General Fund Budget for your approval
prior to its adoption by DDA.

The amount of funds available from the one mill tax for FY 2019-20 has been estimated at
$1,050,000.00, net of collection delinquencies and reserves for tax settlements representing an
increase of $100,000.00 from 2018-19 due to an increase in property valuations. Transfer from
the Tax Increment Fund will remain unchanged from the 2018-19 budgeted allocation of
$750,000.00.

The FY 2019-20 budget reflects revenues of $800,000.00 to be generated from the parking
operations, representing a reduction of $700,000.00 in parking revenues from the FY 2018-19
budget due to the sale of DDA surface lots for the Monroe Block project. It should be noted that
these parking lots were always intended to be a temporary revenue source until they would be
included in a development. Other/Events Center Revenues are estimated at $15,000.00,
representing a reduction of $28,000.00 from FY 2018-19 due to the completion of arena building
activities. A Fund balance of $350,000 represents an expected excess of expenses over
revenues.

On the appropriations side, contractual services of $1,940,000.00, reflects a $2,000.00 increase
from FY 2018-19 due to an anticipated increase in audit expense. The budgeted amount of
$550,000.00 for professional services and fees, inclusive of a $10,000.00 expense for Computer
Support, representing an increase of $20,000.00 from FY 2018-19 due to an anticipated increase
in insurance premiums. There is a $75,000.00 budgeted expense related to parking operations
for FY 2019-20, this represents a $50,000.00 decrease from FY 2018?2019 due to a decrease in
the amount of lots owned by DDA requiring maintenance and security. Finally, $500,000.00 of
allocated funds for Special Projects and Contingencies for FY 2019-20 indicates no increase from
last year.

Find attached the map, dtd. May 28, 20] 9, which identifies the proposed modi?cations of Council
Member Scott Benson and Council President Pro-Tem Mary Sheffield.

Each council member is encouraged to review and consider the proposed modifications when making
changes to their respective districts. Please keep in mind that NEZ Homesteads were created to stabilize
neighborhoods and facilitate investment in single-family homes in our city. This is a powerful tool
capable of both assisting in the revitalization of Detroit?s middle class and retaining residency.

As individual council members, you are best positioned to know the nuances of the city within your
speci?c council district and to take a broader view where necessary. I continue to urge council members
to review the proposed changes and to accept or modify the suggestions accordingly.
