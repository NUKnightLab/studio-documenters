III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 19, the Committee discussed the subject of the provision of dental services at
Cermak Health Services. Director Richardson-Lowry commented that, when she toured Cermak, staff indicated
that, without exception, detainees’ dominant need is dental services, typically on an emergent basis. Chair Reiter
requested that the administration provide a report reflecting statistics on the number and type of procedures done
at Cermak.
With regard to request number 20, Board Chair Hammock inquired regarding the Group Purchasing Organization
(GPO) methodology used to select the vendor. He noted that this vendor under the GPO is located in Michigan;
he inquired whether any of the other vendors under the GPO for this product are located locally, or whether any
local minority firms are involved in the contract. Mr. Jones stated that the vendor, Stryker, is the manufacturer of
this equipment, which is a direct capital equipment purchase; if this was a turnkey solution involving installations,
then they would partner with a local minority or women-owned business enterprise to do the installation. He
indicated that one (1) of the other two (2) vendors is Hill-Rom, which is located in Indiana. He was unsure of the
third vendor; he stated that he will provide the information following the meeting.
Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the
approval of request numbers 1 through 21, subject to completion of review by

 Financials through August 2018
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the information contained in the report. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information on the Income Statement (Slide 4 of the presentation), Board Chair
Hammock inquired regarding the expenses for supplies, which are $18 million over budget; he asked whether the
budget has been adjusted yet by the County. Pursuant to County Budget Resolution, the System is permitted to
grow its budget if its revenues grow in managed care; there was action anticipated to increase the appropriation
based on increased revenues in managed care. Mr. Akpan responded that the transfer of funds has been done, and
the budget is expected to be adjusted next month.
