recommended for approval the following two items.
(Item 1)
The resolution for Item 1 approves the award of contracts to Yolaine Dauphin and Joel Skinner as
Hearing Officers for the CHA Housing Choice Voucher Program. In December, 2016, the Board
originally awarded contracts to twelve Hearing Officers and three Presenters. After these awards were
issued, however, two Hearing Officer awardees withdrew from being hearing officers. In light of these
withdrawals, the recommendation is that the next two highest ranking applicants for the Hearing Officer
positions be awarded contracts to fill the above-referenced vacancies. Each of the original awardee
contracts were for a one-year base term beginning January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The
contracts for the two new recommended awardees will be for the remainder of this same term, along
with the same two one-year options for each contract. The aggregate not to exceed amount for each oneyear term remains at $900,000 collectively for all hearing officers and presenters under this program.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-43
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated May 16, 2017, entitled “AUTHORIZATON TO AWARD CONTRACTS
TO TWO (2) ILLINOIS LICENSED ATTORNEYS TO ACT AS HEARING OFFICERS
FOR HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS,
FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL OF TWO (2) RECENT HEARING OFFICER
AWARDEES.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT

the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorizes that the Chief Executive Officer
approve the award of contracts to two (2) Hearing Officers, Yolaine Dauphin and Joel
R. Skinner, for the term of June 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, which is the
remaining portion of the base term of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017.
Each contract will have two (2) one-year options. The aggregate not to exceed
amount for each one-year term remains at $900,000 collectively for all hearing
officers and presenters under this program. The Board delegates authority to the
Chief Executive Officer to use his discretion to exercise the options. The Chief
Executive Officer shall not exercise more than one option in any year.

(Item 2)
The resolution for Item 2 approves the participation in the City of Chicago’s Contract No. 28364 with
Canon Solutions America, Inc. to lease multi-functional photocopiers, related products and services for a
five year term beginning June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2022 in an aggregate amount of $1,118,721.00
to provide a total of thirty-eight multi-functional devices with the option to purchase the equipment at
the expiration of the lease. The Authority currently owns copiers provided by several vendors governed
by a variety of contracts. These multifunctional devices provide copy/print/scan/fax functionality at the
CHA headquarters and the Family Investment Center sites. The current copiers experience frequent
breakdowns and/or have expiring maintenance contracts. Maintaining the existing copier stock is
neither cost-effective, nor capable of meeting the current and future business needs. The CHA needs to
replace existing copiers to control costs, eliminate constant copier breakdowns and to produce quality
documents.
RESOLUTION NO. 2017-CHA-44

CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:

years beginning June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2022, with the option to purchase the
copier equipment at the end of the applicable lease term.

enrichment and work experiences. Participants receive on-going job readiness instruction and career
exploration while working 140 hours over the course of seven weeks. 100% of the grant funds will be
used to pay training wages to CHA youth. CHA’s participation in SYEP contributes to the One Summer
Chicago overall goal of engaging approximately 31,000 youth in paid summer youth opportunities. In

The resolution for Item 5 approves submittal of a Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) financing
plans to HUD and enter into RAD Conversion Commitments with HUD for Lorraine Hansberry
Apartments, Hilliard Senior 1 Apartments and Hilliard Senior 2 Apartments; commit CHA funds not to
exceed $10,700,000 to fund (i) an initial deposit to the replacement reserve, rehabilitation, site work and
transaction costs for Lorraine Hansberry Apartments; and (ii) a portion of the site work at Hilliard Senior
1 Apartments and Hilliard Senior 2 Apartments; execute Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) contracts;
transfer ownership of the Lorraine Hansberry Apartments improvements to Chicago Housing
Administration LLC and execute a 99-year ground lease for the land. Lorraine Hansberry
Apartments located at 5670 W. Lake Street, is a 9-story building designated as senior public housing
that after rehabilitation will contain 168 residential rental units that will be covered by the RAD housing
assistance payment contract. The building needs minor rehabilitation including some exterior façade
repairs, interior finishes replacement and elevator modernization. Longer range plans include more
extensive rehabilitation over the next 20 years. At the RAD conversion closings, CHA will transfer
ownership of the improvements to Chicago Housing Administration LLC and execute a 99-year Ground
Lease for the underlying land. Hilliard 1 Senior Apartments, located at 2111 S. Clark Street, is part of
a larger redevelopment of buildings originally constructed from 1963 to 1966. Led by the developer,
Holsten Development, the complete rehabilitation of Hilliard 1 was completed in 2005. Hilliard 1
Senior Apartments is a 16- story building with 176 units of which up to 82 are subject to a HAP contract
with CHA and the remaining 94 are presently public housing to be converted to RAD PBV. Hilliard 2
Senior Apartments, located at 30 W. Cermak, is also part of the larger redevelopment previously
described. Led by the developer, Holsten Development, the complete rehabilitation of Hilliard 2 was

81 are subject to a HAP contract with CHA, one is a non-restricted management unit and the remaining
94 are presently public housing to be converted to RAD PBV. The CHA Board previously authorized
the submission of a RAD financing plan to enter into a RAD Conversion Commitment with HUD for
Hilliard 1 Senior Apartments, Hilliard 1 Family Apartments, Hilliard 2 Senior Apartments and Hilliard 2
Family Apartments in January 2016. However, subsequent to Board approval, it was determined that the
family units should not transition to RAD and the senior buildings would better serve the residents if
they were 100% PBV-subsidized units. RAD Physical Condition Assessments (PCAs) were prepared for
the subject properties to determine the capital needs of the buildings over the 20-year term of the

 proposed initial HAP contracts. The total amount from the RAD budget based on CHA’s review of the
PCAs and planning for common area projects was determined to not exceed $10,700,000.

(Item 9)
The resolution for Item 9 approves submittal of a Disposition Application to HUD for the disposition of
property comprising the Washington Park (45th & Cottage Grove) Phase I development site. In April
2010, CHA and The Habitat Company, in its official capacity as Receiver for the development of new,
non-elderly public housing, issued a two-part solicitation, a Request for Qualifications-Request for
Proposals to redevelop a CHA owned site at 45th and Cottage Grove as well as vacant in-fill city-owned
lots in the general area of 44th Street and Langley Avenue. This CHA land formerly contained two
public housing high rise buildings known as Washington Park Properties. Under the solicitation, the
CHA aimed to restore the historic character of Cottage Grove with a vibrant new mixed-income, mixeduse property containing approximately 150-185 residential units, including 40 apartments for public
housing families, and up to 25,000 square feet of retail/commercial space. In February 2011, CHA
selected the Brinshore-Michaels development team to redevelop the 45th and Cottage Grove site.
Presently, CHA seeks to proceed with the first phase of development contemplated under the
redevelopment plan for 45th and Cottage Grove. The Phase I rental development will create 84 units
including 21 CHA, 38 affordable and 25 market rate apartments. This disposition activity was identified

 (Item 10)
The resolution for Item 10 approves submittal of a Disposition Application to HUD for the disposition of
property comprising Roosevelt Square Phase IIA for sale development site. Under the Plan for
Transformation, CHA outlined a strategy for the redevelopment of the ABLA homes. The plan for the
90-acre site called for the creation of 2,441 new units. The plan promised 755 CHA units, 720 affordable
units and 966 market rate units. By the end of 2006, 591 total housing units were delivered between two
phases. Phase I for sale delivered 233 units and Phases I and II rental delivered 358 units. In 2005, CHA
and its development partner Related Midwest executed the Roosevelt Square Phase II rental transaction
and constructed 177 new units of public housing and affordable rental units immediately north and south
of Roosevelt Road. The original Phase II plan called for a seamless development containing market rate
for sale units adjacent to CHA and affordable rental units. Shortly after the completion of the rental
portion of Phase II, the real estate market stalled and the Phase II for sale component was never
completed. Today, vacant lots are interspersed with the rental development and the proposed Phase IIA
for sale development will provide up to 60 units of market rate infill housing. Presently, CHA seeks to
proceed with the for sale development activities contemplated under Roosevelt Square Phase IIA. The
development area is generally bounded by Taylor Street on the north, Roosevelt Road on the south,
Loomis Street on the west, and Racine Avenue on the east.This board action will provide authorization
to proceed with the land disposition for Phase IIA development at Roosevelt Square, a portion of the
former Robert Brooks homes site, which contemplates the construction of approximately 60 units of for
sale housing.This disposition activity was identified in the CHA FY2003 MTW Annual Plan approved
by HUD.
