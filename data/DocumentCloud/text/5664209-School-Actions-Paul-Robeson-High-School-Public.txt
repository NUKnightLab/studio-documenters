This meeting is part of a broader timeline.

CPS

23

began publishing the draft guidelines for school actions

24

on October 1st and then announcing the proposed action

TOOMEY REPORTING

 January 17, 2018

on December 1st.

2

hosted -- This is our second community meeting, and we

3

will have one public hearing at the end of this month to

4

gather additional feedback.

5

and time for that at the end of this meeting.

6

Following this announcement, CPS

I will give you the date

The CEO, Dr. Jackson, at that time may make a

7

recommendation to the Board to vote on the proposed

8

action and then following the potential recommendation,

9

the Board will vote on whether or not to approve the

10
11

action at the February board meeting.
We do have a presentation that we want to bring

12

up now, and I'm going to ask Chief Hougard and her

13

staff, Dr. Julious Lawson, if they will come up and walk

14

you through the proposal just so that those may be

15

attending for the first time can understand exactly what

16

this is all about.

17

MS. HOUGARD:

Thank you.

Thank you.

Good evening.

I do want

18

to also thank you all for coming.

19

and students here as well and appreciate you all taking

20

the time and being open to the conversations we've had

21

at the schools.

22

I see many teachers

As Mr. Johnson said, the timeline -- Moving on

23

to the next slide.

24

engaging the public before this proposal was launched.

The district spent a lot of time

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 8

The Englewood CAC recommended -- after meeting for about

2

a year, recommended that CPS create a new state of the

3

art high school and invest in Englewood, as well as

4

planning for the transition with the existing high

5

schools.

6

In turn, in June of 2017, CPS followed through

7

on the recommendation by formally proposing an

8

investment to create that state of the art neighborhood

9

high school, and I say neighborhood, open enrollment

10

high school intentionally.

11

$75 million commitment, and it has grown to a $85

12

million commitment.

13

The investment started as a

When CPS accepted the proposal to move forward,

14

we also created a community leadership Steering

15

Committee.

16

through many meetings often challenging conversations to

17

talk about the focus of the school and to plan for the

18

transition of the existing Englewood high schools.

The Steering Committee has been tasked

19

Over these multiple meetings between the

20

Steering Committee and CPS leadership, as well as visits

21

to the existing Englewood high schools, a variety of

22

options were considered.

23

high schools included closure and multi-year phaseouts.

24

And ultimately the vote that was taken was on two

Those options for the current

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 9
1

options and the majority vote of the Steering Committee

2

was to close the high schools at the end of 2017-18

3

school year, providing robust transitions for

4

individualized student support as part of the draft

5

transition plan.

6

The meetings have included parent meetings,

7

student meetings, open public meetings, of course.

8

Administrators and teachers have been present as well

9

and broader communities meetings.

10

And we have heard

many things including concerns from students as well.

11

Should the Board vote for this proposed school

12

action, the Steering Committee has been clear that the

13

district must provide robust supports.

14

that are included in the transition plan are directly

15

from those conversations in the Steering Committee.

The supports

16

Students will not automatically be assigned to a

17

new school, rather we will have individual meetings with

18

parents and students to really have a private

19

conversation of what is the best fit for that

20

transition.

21

around those supports.

22

further slides.

23
24

And then there will be extensive planning
And we'll talk about that in

And the committee also really focused on the
need for academic supports this year before the end of

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 10

this school year.

2

programs.

3

really robust safety plans that Jadine Chou will discuss

4

as well.

5

Those will include after school

We talked about transportation needs and

So in the upcoming slides, you will see more

6

details about all of those supports, and I know there

7

are members of the Steering Committee here as well.

8

But, again, it was really heartfelt, thought, tough

9

conversations in those Steering Committees to put all of

10
11

those pieces together in the transition plan.
So over the last ten years and we've talked a

12

lot about declining enrollment, but it's really in the

13

last ten years we've seen declines from 70 to 85 percent

14

of students at these Englewood high schools.

15

When I worked at Harper, we had 900 students.

16

That wasn't that many years ago.

17

that means now, the majority of our elementary students,

18

92 percent, in fact, who live in these high school

19

boundaries go to other schools outside of the Englewood

20

community.

21

schools that are left with between 90 and 135 students

22

at each of the schools.

23
24

When you look at what

The existing -- The current Englewood

When we visited -- When the Steering Committee
visited the high schools, the reality of what you can

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 11
1

offer within a school with 90 to 135 students was really

2

what stood out for us all and that's where the plan --

3

the robust supports came in, the planning.

4

MR. LAWSON:

So in thinking around the new high

5

school -- First, it feels really good to be back at

6

Hamilton Park.

7

and after school classes as well, but that's not why I'm

8

here.

9

I used to take wood shop classes here

So just think around the proposal.

So in June

10

of 2017, CPS decided to move forward with the CAC's

11

proposal to -- the CAC's recommendation to propose this

12

$85 million investment in Englewood.

13

state of the art neighborhood high school.

14

This $85 million

Should the Board approve this -- Should the

15

Board approve this proposal, I'm sorry, the school is

16

slated to open in the fall 2019 with a freshman class

17

only and so if you have been around the city or watching

18

the moves of the district, you will notice that Sara Lee

19

Goode and Dyett have both opened with freshman classes

20

only.

21

Some of the highlights in thinking around the

22

school itself will include a school-based health center

23

that will provide access to the community, comprehensive

24

primary care, behavioral health as well for all of the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 12
1

residents of Englewood, and it will be situated in the

2

high school.

3

There will be a really strong partnership with

4

Kennedy-King College which will include early college

5

programs.

6

offered to the community, as well as the high school

7

students there, of course.

8

to hand it over to Chief Liz Kirby, Office of Network

9

Support.

10

Of course, the sports facility will also be

And with that, I would like

She has a really extensive knowledge of the

schools being the former chief of Network 11.

11

MS. KIRBY:

12

name is Liz Kirby.

13

Network 11 from 2011 until 2015 so I have intimate

14

knowledge of the schools and the challenges that they

15

have been facing specifically as it relates to

16

enrollment and the challenges in offering a full

17

academic program of students as your enrollment

18

continues to decline.

19

Thank you.

Good evening, everyone.

My

I was previously the chief of

I'm going to talk about a couple of things.

The

20

first is, I'm going to go over what the transition plans

21

would look like for students that are currently enrolled

22

at those schools.

23

spring, supports for the summer and then ongoing

24

supports.

We will talk about supports for the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 13
1

I'm not going to read through each and every

2

bullet point here because I know you all are also

3

reviewing this.

4

we are going to invest $8.3 million in a three and a

5

half year transition program to ensure that as

6

schools -- as students go to different schools, they

7

have both the academic and the social emotional supports

8

that they need.

9

One point I want to underscore is that

Megan talked about the individual meetings that

10

will happen with students and families in the

11

individualized transition plans.

12

that students go to schools that really connect to their

13

interest, that will meet the needs that they have

14

identified, and that they will go to those schools with

15

information to help those new principals and new

16

teachers really support them in realizing their high

17

school goals but also post secondary outcomes.

18

We want to make sure

So some of those supports that will happen

19

beginning this spring include workshops in a high school

20

fair so parents can really find out the types of

21

programs that schools will be offering for students.

22

Again, those individualized transition plans which will

23

include not only the academic supports but also any

24

needed post secondary social emotional supports, safety

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 14
1
2

plans, et cetera.
Tutoring and academic supports for students will

3

be offered and we will work -- My job -- I oversee all

4

the networks in all the schools so we will also

5

continuously make sure that the academic quality that

6

students are getting exposed to at those schools meet

7

their needs and make needed adjustments accordingly.

8
9

We have resources that we will have for students
who need additional assistance.

That include students

10

that are in our temporary living program, STLS program,

11

and students that are diverse learners and will continue

12

to work with principals around all these supports.

13

For the summer, some of the supports that we

14

have planned include jobs for students and if needed,

15

academic -- any kind of academic support either

16

enrichment or remediation based upon the academic needs

17

of the students.

18

they have an opportunity to meet the students and the

19

staff and the principal in leadership of their new

20

schools to make that transition.

21

And we also want to make sure that

So one thing that we do at many of our high

22

schools is we do a freshman connection program to make

23

sure the students get acclimated to their new

24

environment.

We're imagining a similar program where

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 15
1

students have an early opportunity to get acclimated to

2

the school that they decide to attend.

3

In terms of ongoing supports, and a lot of this

4

has come out in the discussions that we've been having

5

both with the Steering Committee and at the schools

6

talking to students and parents and teachers, so the

7

transportation has come up as a big issue.

8

this transition period, we will have free CTA cards for

9

students.

So during

We will be expanding the safe passage routes

10

as needed ensuring safe travel for students.

11

again, the academic supports will continue and the

12

social emotional supports will continue for students as

13

well.

14

And,

My job -- Megan and Julious work with the

15

students in the schools in Network 11.

16

work with all schools.

17

all schools, chiefs and those principals to make sure

18

that each and every one of these students is having a

19

good experience and if we need to make adjustments, we

20

make those adjustments accordingly.

21

My job is to

And so I will be working with

The next thing that I wanted to talk about is

22

another topic that came up in the last meeting.

23

were quite a few speakers that talked about, if we're

24

spending this amount of money for a new school, we

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

There

 January 17, 2018
Page 16
1

should take those same funds and invest them back into

2

the four high schools.

3

historical perspective just in response to those

4

comments.

5

I think a lot of times people aren't aware of the

6

previous supports that we've provided to schools.

So I wanted to provide a little

I understand where they are coming from, but

7

So in terms of programmatic investments, and I

8

know this both in my current role but also as a former

9

chief, when we go through the budgeting process every

10

year with schools, for these particular high schools,

11

we've had to add additional funds just so they can offer

12

the classes that kids need to graduate.

13

So before this school plan, before any of the

14

committee work, each and every principal I would have

15

conversations around, let's look at your schedule, let's

16

look at what the kids need, and they would talk to me

17

about additional funds that they needed to run the

18

school.

19

We have made over $4 million in investments over

20

the past three years at these schools.

21

think many people do know that Harper was a turnaround

22

school but TEAM also was a part of their renaissance

23

2010 program.

24

both Harper and TEAM, we have almost $6 million of

In addition, I

When we look at the funds invested for

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 17
1

investments for those schools.

2

Finally, if we look at capital investments, just

3

in the '06-'07 school year, we have $29 million in

4

capital investments.

5

no money has been given to these schools.

6

additional money that we've provided knowing that we

7

really wanted to make sure kids have what they needed in

8

order to meet the requirements to graduate.

9

So this is not a situation where
This has been

The challenge of having declining enrollment

10

makes it difficult to offer a wide variety of classes.

11

And so this has been the district's response to assist

12

these schools to meet those requirements.

13

So we've made these investments.

Megan was at

14

Harper as an assistant principal when they were a SIG

15

school.

16

decline and decline and decline at these schools.

17

just wanted to provide that context.

18

In spite of that, enrollment has continued to
I

I'm next going to turn it over to Jadine who can

19

talk more specifically about safety supports and plans

20

for the school.

21

MS. CHOU:

Good evening, everybody.

I am the chief

22

of safety and security for Chicago Public Schools, and

23

we thought it would be worthwhile to call out a specific

24

section on safety and security because safety -- One

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 18
1

thing we can all agree on is that safety is our top

2

priority for our children.

3

We have been having parent meetings.

We have

4

been having student meetings and over and over we

5

continue to hear, how are we going to address safety

6

concerns.

7

some background.

8

in previous slides that others have spoken this evening

9

already, but I want to bring it into the context of

10
11

So I want to take a quick moment to just give
And, again, you have seen some of this

safety.
Currently, 92 percent of students living within

12

the Englewood boundaries, students who are eligible to

13

attend these Englewood schools are currently already

14

traveling outside to other schools in other communities.

15

Why that's important is because we've already worked

16

through some of these issues.

17

worked through all of them, but we do understand some of

18

the things that happened when children travel and

19

commute to other communities.

20

It's not to say we've

Some examples of some of the highest enrolled

21

schools right now is Simeon, Dunbar, Hyde Park, Curie.

22

These are schools that kids within the Englewood

23

boundary are currently attending from within this

24

neighborhood.

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 19
1

So to address these safety concerns, and I'm

2

going to give a very high-level approach here, but I

3

want to start by saying, every child going through this

4

transition will get an individualized safety plan.

5

will make sure of that, that all these safety concerns

6

are addressed on an individualized basis which will

7

depend on that child's specific situation and their

8

school selection.

We

9

One thing in common of everyone, for those who

10

will be commuting, they will have, as we stated on the

11

previous slide, free CTA cards to get them to and from

12

their selected schools.

We currently use safe passage

13

in many of our schools.

We will expand those safe

14

passage routes.

15

children are going, we want to make sure that we have

16

sufficient coverage.

17

Considering, depending on where these

We talked about this earlier.

For those that --

18

where there are CTA buses, we will stage these buses so

19

that we don't have big groups of children waiting for

20

their buses at arrival and at dismissal.

21

feedback that we've heard from parents.

22

feedback that we've heard from the Steering Committee.

23
24

This is
This is

One more thing that's not on the slide that I
want to call out that's very important that we heard

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 20
1

loud and clear from adults which is, if there are a

2

certain number of kids that choose a school, let's say,

3

20 kids choose school blah, blah, blah, we would love to

4

work with parents to decide is a shuttle bus a good

5

option for those children.

6

We heard from the adults that shuttle busses

7

would be appealing for children.

8

the students, however, who are very independent in some

9

cases, I'm too cool to ride a yellow bus.

These are

10

things that we want to work out, though.

If that is

11

something that works for the communities, if that is

12

something that makes parents feel safer and children

13

closing all the neighborhood schools in Englewood.

22

cities will seek -- they will see the sick behavior

For the last 20 years, we

We at the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless

18

stand against the closing of the four high schools in

19

20

homeless individuals and families is because closing

21

that school will have a disproportionate impact on

22

homeless students.

23
24

The main reason why because we represent

Across the entire CPS system, 4.7 percent of the
students experience homelessness.

Collectively in these

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 17, 2018
Page 46
1

four high schools, the number is closer to 20 percent of

2

the students who experience homelessness.

3

The CPS closure of these schools will have a --

4

will have the inability of the students who face

5

homelessness and increase many barriers for them.

6

attendance and success rates will be lower.

7

to have mobility issues that other students don't have.

8

It will disrupt their parent/teacher relationships which

9

would lead to less days in school, which will lead to

10
11

The

They tend

miseducation and uneducation.
The proposed closing of these schools is also

12

unfair to the current students because they will not be

13

able to attend the new school that will open.

14

that when they close these schools that the students

15

will have access to higher performing schools that are a

16

good match for their needs but nothing in the transition

17

plans that we have seen indicate that these students

18

will have access to higher performing schools.

19

CPS says

And this is critical because of a study that was

20

released in 2015 regarding schools that have closed in

21

Chicago which said that -- This is from the Chicago

22

Consortium on School Research.

23

that says CPS school closures -- Sorry.

24

be quick because I know I'm running out of time.

They issued a report

But

 January 17, 2018
Page 47
1

only students who attend substantially higher performing

2

schools after a school has closed will have better

3

economic outcomes.

4

The likelihood that it will happen here is that

5

when these schools close, that the students will end up

6

going into other neighborhood high schools that have

7

been created by rejoined boundaries and those schools

8

are not higher performing schools than the four schools

9

that they are closing.

10

In addition, the timeline that the CPS has set

11

for closing these schools is unrealistic.

12

three items on the timeline have January 30th deadlines.

13

They haven't even formally voted yet on whether they

will close the school.

the underenrollment because, you know, the enrollment

23

the schools are because I spent the morning with dozens

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

Hey, I'm baffled that they

22

actually think that this one school is going to be a

23

better solution than improving the four that's already

24

here.

I actually am.

And not only are they trying to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

close these schools, they are actually talking about

2

closing the one plus elementary school that's in the

3

South Loop down -- close by 20th and State to create a

4

new high school?

5

And I don't blame the ones that's for it to

6

close the school because the perspective is just not

7

what you know but it's what you know, what you see and

8

what you can infer so what I say each one, teach one.

9

And they actually think that building this new

10

school that's actually going to change anything.

11

just because if you put bad apples in a new basket

12

doesn't change anything.

13

that these kids that's coming into this new school

14

already have their own mentality.

15

mentality and that's not going -- really going to change

16

anything.

17

years after they create it.

18

But

What they fail to realize is

They have the hood

That's not going to change the school five

So what they really need to do is put money

19

inside the school that's already here.

20

and reconstruct the minds that are already here so we

can teach each other and rebuild our own community.

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

I sat here today, and I

listened to some of the things that you people were

2

saying about the schools closing.

3

from Harper, I thought she spoke real eloquently when

4

she was saying that, you know, why won't they invest

5

money in our schools, you know.

6

our schools.

7

And the young lady

Why won't they rebuild

Why won't they do this.

The brother, Darrell Smith, said, you know, you

8

ain't even got to put 85 million in our schools.

9

million in each school and watch how these kids will

Put 10

10

perform because all these resources keep going --

11

leaving Englewood and going to these other places and

12

those kids are excelling.

13

You don't hear about the other schools getting

14

shutdown.

15

and alternative schools and that type of stuff.

16

me it's like I understand it, you know what I mean.

17

understand what's going on.

18

plan.

19

Everything here is always about turnaround
So to
I

I understand that is the

And I want to use a word insidious.
See, we sitting here and a lot of us are against

20

each other.

A lot of us are for it.

21

against it.

But one thing that we should all have in

22

common is our kids.

23

guys to think about, you know.

24

not, your little kids, little kids five years old,

A lot of us are

So it's a statistic that I want you
Whether you know it or

they're being studied right now.

2

This is not nothing that I made up myself.

Go

3

look it up on the internet when I leave here.

4

being studied right now at five years old because by the

5

time that they're ten years old, if they can't read on a

6

fifth grade level -- If they can't read on a fifth grade

7

level, three out of four of those kids, that's 75

8

percent, will be in prison by the time they're 21 years

9

old.

10

They're

You understand what I'm saying?
So they're studying your kid now.

If you know

11

that illiteracy -- If they can't read, that mean they're

12

illiterate.

13

hand, then you will be thinking about improving our

14

schools, but that's not what you're thinking about.

15

They are studying your child right now to understand how

16

many prison cells they need in the next ten years.

17

If illiteracy and criminology go hand in

So these school closing is by design.

Don't

18

think this is a accident that they're really trying to

19

make stuff better, you understand what I'm saying.

20

While we're sitting here talking about I want this for

21

the betterment and all this, that's not for the

22

betterment.

23

watch how we perform.

24

Put some money in these schools and then

Thank you.
