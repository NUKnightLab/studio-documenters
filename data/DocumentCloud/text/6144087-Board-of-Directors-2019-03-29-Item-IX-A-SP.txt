Multi-Specialty Practice Groups
On the rise nationally-why?
1. Better communication among your physicians. Seeing aligned doctors promotes collaboration and ensures more
efficient care. Medical groups utilize a common EHRs that facilitate sharing of information. Improved communication helps
improve outcomes.
2. Access to new treatments and technology. Not only will do MSPGs provide access to additional physicians and
experts, but increased access to new treatments and technologies as well. Integrated medical groups combine the assets of a
particular health care organization.

3. Coordinated care. Integrated medical groups employ physicians who practice in hospital and ambulatory settings,
mitigating potential disruption in care when being admitted or discharged. Working as a team improves efficiency and
quality.
4. Higher standards of quality monitoring. Integrated medical groups have more resources to devote to monitoring
and improving the care provided.

5. Additional clinical resources. As part of a broader health system, physicians in an integrated group can draw on a
wider array of clinical services. These may include things like home care, diabetes education, smoking cessation, cardiac
rehabilitation, and others. It's no longer just visiting your doctor when you are sick.
