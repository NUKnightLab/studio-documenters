Proposal: The applicant is proposing to build a new residential structure on the property. To do
so, an area within the riparian setback would need to be impacted so that equipment can access
the site during construction.

Agency Comments: Italicized text indicates quotations from submitted agency comments.
SWCD: Alina Godbey, 06/19/2019:
This letter is regarding parcel 4503620, located in Sagamore Hills Township at 7528 Holzhauer
Road. The applicant is proposing to build a new residential structure on the property. To do so, an
area within the riparian setback would need to be impacted so that equipment can access the site
during construction.
A stream with a watershed of 1.1 square miles is located on the property directly south of this
parcel. The base riparian setback extends 75 feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream
and into this parcel. A wetland also exists on the parcel, however following a wetland delineation
and US Army Corps jurisdictional determination, the wetland was determined by Summit SWCD
to not be connected to the riparian setback, and therefore does not fall under the Summit County
riparian ordinance.
In order to access the southeast comer of the home during construction, a portion of the base
riparian setback would need to be cleared and disturbed by construction equipment. An outlet for
downspouts and footer drains would also be installed within the riparian setback. According to
Summit County Chapter 937.07, "The following uses are specifically prohibited within the riparian

Summit County Planning Commission

setback: ... ( d) Motorized Vehicles. There shall be no use of motorized vehicles of any kind, except
as permitted under these regulations. (e) Modification of Natural Vegetation. Modification of the
natural vegetation shall be limited to conservation maintenance that the landowner deems
necessary to control noxious weeds; for such plantings as are consistent with these regulations;
for such disturbances as are approved under these regulations; and for the passive enjoyment,
access and maintenance of landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of these
regulations." This project is proposing to clear, disturb soil, and operate machinery within the
riparian setback, which are considered prohibited uses under the riparian setback ordinance.
The homeowners and site designers have worked with the Summit SWCD and have made a good
faith effort to move the proposed home as far as possible out of the riparian setback area. If this
variance is granted to the homeowners, the riparian setback should be replanted with native trees
and vegetation following construction, to restore its function as a natural buffer area. Further,
the outlet for the downspouts and footer drains will need to be designed to properly dissipate
flow to prevent scouring and erosion.
Staff Comments:
Per the report from Summit Soil and Water Conservation District:
• The proposed building of new structures within the riparian setback is non-conforming.
• The homeowners and site designers have made a good faith effort to move the
proposed home as far as possible out of the riparian setback area, while maintaining
reasonable front yard setbacks.
• In order to access the southeast comer of the home during construction, a portion of
the base riparian setback would need to be cleared and disturbed by construction
equipment.
• An outlet for downspouts and footer drains would also be installed within the riparian
setback.
• A wetland also exists on the parcel, however following a wetland delineation and US
Army Corps jurisdictional determination, the wetland was determined by Summit SWCD
to not be connected to the riparian setback, and therefore does not fall under the
Summit County riparian ordinance.
• According to Summit County Chapter 937.07, "The following uses are specifically
prohibited within the riparian setback: ... ( d) Motorized Vehicles. There shall be no use
of motorized vehicles of any kind, except as permitted under these regulations. (e)
Modification of Natural Vegetation. Modification of the natural vegetation shall be
limited to conservation maintenance that the landowner deems necessary to control
noxious weeds; for such plantings as are consistent with these regulations; for such
disturbances as are approved under these regulations; and for the passive enjoyment,
access and maintenance of landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of these
regulations." This project is proposing to clear, disturb soil, and operate machinery
within the riparian setback, which are considered prohibited uses under the riparian
setback ordinance.

 7528 Holzhauer Rd, Riparian Variance

If this variance is granted to the homeowners, the riparian setback should be replanted
with native trees and vegetation following construction, to restore its function as a
natural buffer area. Further, the outlet for the downspouts and footer drains will need
to be designed to properly dissipate flow to prevent scouring and erosion.
Per the applicant:
• The property was acquired before May 29, 2002 when the Riparian Setback Ordinance
was enacted.
• The hardship was created by enactment of the riparian setback post creation of the
parcel. As stated, every effort has been made to minimize the impact while at the same
time preventing the investment in the parcel from losing its entire value by
implementation of the riparian setback.
• The home will be outside the setback but the use of the setback area is critical to
construction and final grading
•

Recommendation: SCPC Staff defers to Summit SWCD Staff’s recommendation for the Variance to be
APRROVED.

The stream will not be impacted as a result of the variance request and the riparian setback will be
impacted to allow for construction equipment to excavate the corner of the home and set trusses.
The impact will be minimal and temporary so to allow for construction and establishment of final grade

 There will be no impact to upstream or downstream properties as this is an isolated impact.

Granting of a variance would be consistent with the public interest inasmuch as the riparian setback
was implemented after the establishment of the parcel and placed an undue hardship on the parcel.
The public interest is such that a previously established parcel should not be encumbered with a hardship
based on a change in regulations.

The variance request is minimal and even so supported by inference given that the USACE has granted
a permit to allow for the filling of wetlands on the parcel so as to accommodate construction of a home.

USACE has granted a permit to fill the wetlands required. See attached.

Literal enforcement will require unconventional construction methods. The home will be outside the
setback but the use of the setback area is critical to construction and final grading

The size, configuration and location of the home have been redesigned to fit the parcel without encroaching
within the riparian setback. Original and preferred design had the foundation with in the riparian setback
but compromise was made to minimize the impact.

 Yes. Parcel was created prior to 2002 and purchase was 1997. see attached

The hardship was created by enactment of the riparian setback post creation of the parcel. As
stated, ever effort has been made to minimize the impact while at the same time preventing the investment
in the parcel from losing its entire value by implementation of the riparian setback.

Twinsburg Township Zoning Commission

Fences
Stephen Knittel

Proposal: Twinsburg Township Zoning Commission is proposing an amendment of Ch. 17
General Provisions to establish the ability for residential property owners to have front yard
fences, provided that they do not exceed 4 ft. in height. Currently no fences are permitted
closer than 25 ft. to any right-of-way.
Proposed Text Amendments: Text that is struck through is text proposed for deletion, new
proposed text is underlined.
CHAPTER 17 GENERAL PROVISIONS
17.1-17.10 [no change]
17.11 Fences. Fences shall be constructed not closer than one foot to any right-ofway in any R district, shall be constructed not closer than 25 feet to any right-of-way
in any other district, shall not exceed eight feet in height in the C, IMU, and I Districts,
and shall not exceed six feet in height in any other district, and shall not exceed four
feet in height when constructed closer than 25 feet to any right-of-way in any R
district. The location, composition, and structure of any fence shall, at a minimum,
conform to the standards and regulations of the Summit County Building Department.
Fences constructed within the Business or Industrial Districts shall conform to the
specific requirements of each District and shall, at a minimum, conform to the standards
of the Summit County Building Department governing their structure, composition,
appearance and location. Barbed wire, razor wire, and similar fences are prohibited,
except that barbed wire fences shall be permitted in the I District, provided that they are
located behind the building line and not less than 50 feet from any property zoned or
used for residential purposes, and provided that any barbs are no closer than six feet to
the ground. Electrified fences are prohibited. All fences shall be positioned at a
distance of not less than one (1) foot inward of the property lines along which they will be
installed and their horizontal supports or braces shall face to the inside of the property
and the finished side shall face outward. Permits will not be required for the installation
of temporary seasonal fences such as snow-fences.
17.12-17.20 [no change]”

 Staff Comments:
Summary of the changes proposed:
17.11 – add language to allow for front yard fences in residential areas.
Comments:
• The height of 4 ft. for a front yard fence is fairly standard in Ohio zoning codes where
front yard fences are permitted.
• Often design guidelines are included as well, staff would recommend the township
consider adding language about the type of fencing permitted in front yards, many
places prohibit chain link fencing in the front yard.
• Consider including language regulating the opacity of the fence, for instance Cuyahoga
Falls zoning states: Have a void of at least 50% up to 4 feet, so that a 4-foot high picket
fence shall have a picket to void ratio of 2:1 or greater transparency.
• Consider including language that states fencing shall not impair line of sight when
entering/exiting a driveway.
Recommendation: Staff recommends to the Summit County Planning Commission that the
proposed text amendments be APPROVED.
