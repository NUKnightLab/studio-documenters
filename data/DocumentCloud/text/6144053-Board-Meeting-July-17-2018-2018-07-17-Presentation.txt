have two kids who attend
Parker Elementary, and once
they graduate from there
they'll go to this new high
school. I always tell them
that you never stop learning
or advancing. I have earned
over 14 certi?cates because
I want to be the best at what
I do and show my kids that
learning never stops. I enjoy
working on my kids' future
school that's only 10 minutes
from our house."

"Since this school was
announced, I've been rallying
for minorities to be employed
. on its construction. Ithinit it's
- great for people outside the
sitefencingtoseeBlackfoIks
building a new school for our
own community. It?s good to
. see when the system works
. and people get the resources
to provide for themselves. I
have a 12 year old son and I
want to send him to this high
school."

- Duane Kidd,
Laborer for 12 years

     

never thought that I
would be working on such
a signi?cant project in such
a familiar neighborhood. A
lot of careful planning has
gone into this school. and it's
great to see the proiect team
and the community working
togeth er: hiring local workers.
seeking input in the design
process. and more. We?re not
just buildinga building, we're
also showing consideration
to the community and its
history.

have a lo yearold son, and
he?s already told his friends
that he wants to go to the
high school that his dad
built."

live just ?ve minutes away from Esmond. and I think that this project is great.
It serves a dual purpose: it provides the community with a new and renovated
school space and the students are able to see this project being built for

them by people who look like them

 

 

It's important for kids to know that people care about their
community and their education. that way they can take that good
feeling into the classroom and be the best that they can be."

school so she can do her homework. This branch is much closer to our house. sol look
forward to bringing her here instead. I think a lot of neighborhood kids will use this

jobs and stay out of trouble.
