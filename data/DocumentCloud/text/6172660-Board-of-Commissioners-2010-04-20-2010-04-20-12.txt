 PROCUREMENT HISTORY
East Lake/West End, LLC was selected as the developer for the HOPE VI Revitalization
Program at Rockwell Gardens as a result of an October, 2001 Request for Proposals (RFP)
issued by the Chicago Housing Authority and the court-appointed Gautreaux Receiver, Daniel E.
Levin and The Habitat Company, LLC (“Habitat”).
EXPLANATION
The West End Phase 2 Rental project consists of new construction mixed income rental units
and community and management space provided in a midrise. The development will be built on
CHA-owned land within the boundaries of West Adams Street (n), West Van Buren Street (s),
Campbell Street (e) and South Maplewood Avenue (w). It is comprised of a variety of low-rise
building types including 2-flats, 3-flats, 4-unit, 6-unit and 10-units buildings. The project will
provide 112 total units of which 98 are affordable tax credit units (including the 65 public
housing units) and 14 market rate units.
In April 2007, the CHA Board approved entering into an Amended and Restated Contract for
Redevelopment for Rockwell Gardens with East Lake Management & Development Corp., as
Sponsor, and East Lake/West End, LLC, as Developer. Pursuant to that agreement, CHA is
required to fund the cost of site remediation for pre-existing conditions on the entire rental
development site (other than costs the Developer would have incurred in any event), subject to
certain rights to terminate for infeasibility. CHA’s contractual responsibility for remediation of
foreseen and unforeseen environmental conditions is capped at 200%. The estimated remediation
cost for the West End Phase 2A Rental Redevelopment site is $1,300,372. CHA’s remediation
responsibility is capped at $2,600,745. Additionally, the contractor has made a commitment to
hire one (1) Section 3 individual.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to enter into a contract with the East
Lake/West End, LLC, for environmental remediation activities to be performed on CHA-owned
land at the West End Phase 2 Rental Development, in an amount not to exceed $2,600,744.
