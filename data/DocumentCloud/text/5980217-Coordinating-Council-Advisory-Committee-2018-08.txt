This memo provides an overview of the Coordinating Council Advisory Committee (CCAC) meeting on
Thursday, August 9, from 1:00-3:00 p.m. at ICJIA’s office at 300 West Adams, Chicago, Suite 200.
The meeting will begin with a member update, giving each program representative the opportunity to
announce any upcoming activities or events of interest to other members.
Next, we will present our draft of the “Data, Planning, and Impact: A Joint Adult Redeploy Illinois and
Criminal Justice Coordinating Council Summit,” report discussed during our June meeting. The report
outlines summit activities, feedback, and how lessons learned from the summit will inform CJCC and
ARI programming moving forward.
Finally, we will continue discussions on how to approach developing a program to support planning and
coordination of state and local coordinating bodies through ICJIA. We will provide committee members
with samples of several planning and coordination funding drafts, including a JAG Notice of Funding
Opportunity meant to support planning and coordination activities in FY 2018-2019, as a reference point
for our discussion. We will also discuss the primary activities a planning and coordination funding
scheme should cover, such as support for dedicated coordinators, research and evaluation, and technical
assistance.

We look forward to your participation.

Approval of Minutes

Discussion on “Data, Planning, and Impact: A Joint Adult Redeploy Illinois and Criminal
Justice Coordinating Councils Summit”
This meeting began with an overview of the upcoming joint conference of Adult
Redeploy and Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils (CJCCs) entitled “Data, Planning,
and Impact: A Joint Adult Redeploy Illinois and Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils
Summit” hosted by ICJIA, Adult Redeploy Illinois, and Loyola University’s Center for
Criminal Justice Research, Policy, and Practice. Director Maki said attending the summit
will be a range of stakeholders from counties and judicial circuits either operating or
interested in developing CJCCs and ARI-funded local prison diversion programs. The
summit will take place in Bloomington May 8-10, 2018.
Director Maki, and Mr. Jackson-Green provided an overview of the agenda. Director
Maki emphasized that the strategic direction for the event will be at the local level. Mr.
Jackson-Green described the various sessions to be held. The summit will focus on issues
pertaining to ARI and CJCC work, with CJCCs being the focus on the first day, ARI
being the focus of the last day and joint sessions during the full day between them.
Participants were invited to attend all days of the summit. Mr. Jackson-Green said the
event will facilitate group discussion among stakeholders and serve as the first step in an
ongoing strategic planning process for each county in attendance.
Director Maki added that the abstract theme of discussion will revolve around how to
coordinate the coordination efforts. He said the overall purpose of the summit is to
identify common elements and themes and determine how ICJIA can then help facilitate.

 Director Maki requested feedback on how to best memorialize summit findings and
disseminate the information. Various types of products were discussed including
webinars, recordings, publications, and reports.
This prompted discussion about the release of notices of funding opportunity and
questions about what board members are and are not allowed to discuss with potential
grantees. Director Maki clarified that board members are allowed to discuss the
application process but should direct other questions to ICJIA. Ms. Hora suggested ICJIA
create a webinar with a question-and-answer session about funidn gopoprtunities.
Director Maki said ICJIA could provide general talking points and basic instructions. In
place of a webinar, Mr. Jackson-Green proposed providing a list of frequently asked
funding opportunity questions with answers to the SOC and other ICJIA board members.
Ms. Rubin, shared totals registered for the Summit for each day and noted maximum
capacity for each day is 250 participants.
Next Steps: ICJIA’s Coordination Work
Director Maki then led a discussion on next steps ICJIA should take after the summit and
encouraged members to think about what they wanted to get out of the event. He
elaborated that overlapping goals following the conference are to engage ARI to think
more broadly about current work, what it can do for county-level stakeholders and how
ICJIA can help them; strengthen and solidify ongoing work with community coordinating
councils; recruit additional counties as CJCC participants; build local constituency for
ICJIA; and for the SOC to think more broadly about issues (outside of funding).
Chair Wolff inquired whether ICJIA would be requesting evaluations from participants.
Director Maki said ICJIA will be administering evaluations to participants at the end of
each day of the summit. Chair Wolff said she was interested in questions ICJIA would be
asking. This prompted discussion about the ongoing research at ICJIA and about
evaluation of projects. Dr. Alderden said ICJIA is conducting evaluations on new
research projects based off an evaluation plan (as of January 2018) and has predetermined research questions for each project. Dr. Alderden said she would be share the
research plan, including research questions and goals, with the board. Planning efforts,
project goals, and evaluation were further discussed.
Mr. Jackson Green noted Juvenile Justice Coordinating Councils were invited to the
summit.
Chair Wolff asked what other state agencies are doing to facilitate coordination. Director
Maki said asking this question on the summit evaluations may be a ground-up approach
to engaging with local level entities and facilitating future discussion.

Approval of Minutes
Minutes from the April 19th CCAC meeting will be approved at the next meeting on
August 9, 2018.
Overview of ICJIA’s Coordinated Activities
This meeting began with Executive Director Maki giving an overview of the purpose and
background of the Coordinating Council Advisory Committee (CCAC) and mentioning
various programs that ICJIA has been coordinating. Mr. Jackson-Green invited ICJIA
staff working on the Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils (CJCC), Adult Redeploy
Illinois (ARI), Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Partnership Focused Deterrence sites,
Family Violence Coordinating Councils (FVCC), and the Violence Against Women Act
(VAWA) Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) program to share the purpose of their programs
and the programs’ main goals for 2018.
Ms. Dyar began the introductions with an overview of ARI. Ms. Dyar discussed how the
ARI program focuses on increasing local jurisdictions’ alternatives to incarceration for
non-violent offenders, and supporting local jurisdictions’ strategic plans that are
evidence-based and data driven. Ms. Dyar shared that ARI’s 2018 main goals included
hosting the ARI/CJCC summit, and preparing for potential legislative changes that would
allow counties to use ARI funding for services for probation-eligible offenders. Chair
Wolff asked Ms. Dyar how many people are served by ARI. Ms. Dyar answered stating
that over four thousand were served since January 2011. Ms. Dyar explained that those
served usually spend eighteen months in the program and that ARI saves money
compared to the cost of incarceration in DOC.

 VAWA program manager Ms. Hailey continued the introduction of programs by
providing an overview of the VAWA MDT program. Ms. Hailey mentioned that the main
goal for the program is to promote coordination and a multidisciplinary response to
crimes against women, while also increasing offender accountability. Ms. Hailey then
stated that the VAWA program is currently funding four counties and twenty-one
agencies. Mr. Jackson-Green asked Ms. Hailey for any major updates for the MDT
program and Ms. Hailey answered by stating that VAWA is preparing to issue new grants
for the MDTs.
Ms. Salazar then provided an overview of the JAG Partnership Focused Deterrence sites,
which focus on targeting offenders to stop shootings. Ms. Salazar discussed the research
behind the focused deterrence model of crime prevention and how current Illinois sites
are implementing the program. Chair Wolff asked Ms. Salazar if the JAG program would
be evaluated. Ms. Salazar stated that at some point it would be, prompting a discussion on
evaluation, research, and multidisciplinary leadership involvement in the program.
Ms. Ratliff shared the purposes and main goals for 2018 of the Illinois FVCC and how
budget cuts have affected this council. Ms. Ratliff went on to explain that the FVCC runs
on a three prong-approach involving local council coordinators, trainings, and community
awareness with domestic violence services.
This discussion moved on to how ICJIA could better support coordination. Dr. Olson
mentioned the JAG Partnership Focused Deterrence sites, which led to a discussion of
multidisciplinary leadership. Ms. Dyar stated that a “common thread navigator”, a
designated staff person responsible for coordinating project efforts, would be beneficial.
Director Maki added that a dedicated project coordinator is a good, inexpensive
investment to support coordination.
Dr. Olson mentioned efforts to develop trends and issues reports for each CJCC
jurisdiction based on the area’s crime data reported to ICJIA and then providing these
reports to county stakeholders. This led to a discussion about the positive facets of
coordination which include helping stakeholders become better grant applicants by
helping stakeholders understand their data, and helping stakeholders use data to inform
appropriate actions in their jurisdictions. Dr. Olson added that giving stakeholders a
report of what their data shows may in turn incentivize county stakeholders to share with
ICJIA various data available to them and thus improve data exchanges within and among
state and local agencies.
Presentation on ARI/CJCC Summit Report
Mr. Jackson-Green then presented on the ARI/CJCC summit held in Bloomington, IL
from May 8th -10th. Mr. Jackson-Green opened the presentation explaining why a joint
summit was held, the goals of the summit, and the participants present at the summit.

 Ms. Dyar explained the various break-out sessions held on critical issues including
emerging adults, being trauma-informed, procedural justice, and medication-assisted
treatment as well as ARI’s focus within the summit. Mr. Jackson-Green summarized the
various break-out sessions and that the overarching goal was to enable the joint sharing of
ideas among CJCC, ARI, and others in attendance.
The discussion of the summit continued with committee members sharing which
breakouts that they thought were helpful. Ms. Hora stated the full-session panel
concerning grant funding was enjoyable and helpful for attendees.
Mr. Jackson-Green continued by addressing the successes and challenges of the summit.
The successes included connections made with additional counties to which ICJIA may
be able to provide trends and issues reports, positive summit evaluations, and the
successful introduction of CJCC and ARI programming to new audiences. Challenges
discussed included the difficulty in developing a summit program relevant to both CJCC
and ARI stakeholders in terms of the summit’s structure and timing. Director Maki
commented on the difficulty of explaining the real-world benefits of coordination
because coordination is such an abstract concept. Ms. Dyar commented on how some
important roles within coordination, such as probation officers, are often not involved in
the conversation of coordination and so summit participants may not see their relevance.
Director Maki asked the Committee to consider whether planning grants should be
prioritized to support the CJCC.
Further discussion focused on the role of suburban and rural counties in CJCC and ARI
efforts and their unique challenges. The discussion continued around how these
jurisdictions deal with challenges, including available resources, funding, grants, and
problem-solving strategies, differently than more urban counties, and how ICJIA can
make a better effort to assist them.
Mr. Jackson-Green asked for further suggestions and comments regarding the summit
and mentioned that publication of the summit report is expected by the next CCAC
meeting on August 9, 2018.
New Business
There was no new business.
Public Comment
Chair Wolff offered the floor for public comment. Attendee Bobae Kang offered public
comment regarding ICJIA providing data collection and project evaluation training to
counties aimed at helping them develop self-sustainable programs. ICJIA should help
counties understand the data they collect and have the tools to conduct an independent
analysis. Then, ICJIA could function as a facilitator to the various stakeholders, rather
than taking on the task of this research for every locality.
