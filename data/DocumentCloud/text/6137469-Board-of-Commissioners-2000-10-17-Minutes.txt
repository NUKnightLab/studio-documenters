ELECTION JUDGES COMPENSATION INCREASE

Transm itting a Communication, dated October 16, 2000 from
DA YID ORR, County Clerk
Requesting your concurrence in increasing the compensation paid election judges who serve as supply
key judges. The pay would be $25 .00 for serving as key supply judges, an increase from $5.00. No more
than one election judge per precinct would receive this compensation. For the Primary Election a similar
increase was in effect for the judges who brought materials to the receiving stations after the polls closed.
The pay for these two extra duties that election judges are asked to take on need to be equalized.
Additionally, this step is necessary in order to preserve the parity of supply key judges' pay with the
amount paid by the Board of Election Commissioners of the City of Chicago to its supply judges.
Initially, these amounts would be paid to election judges for the November 7, 2000 General Election.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $49,480.00. (524-267 Account).

This Amendatory Ordinance shall take effect upon passage.

*Referred to the Personnel Compliance Committee on 8/9/00.
Commissioner Schumann asked where did the amended language come from?
Mark Kilgallon stated that approximately twelve jurisdictions including the City of Chicago were
surveyed.
Commissioner Maldonado asked what is the average time of service for a veteran?
Chairman Moran responded that the average time is two years.
Commissioner Maldonado asked what is the rationale for selecting six mont hs rather than two years?
Mark Kilgallon responded that it provides more of a benefit to the veterans.
Mr. Ki lgallon stated that based on a study done by the Bureau of Human Resources, six months of active
duty was comparable to surrounding jurisdictions.
Comm issioner Maldonado asked what would be cons idered six months service and what types of soldier
classifications would serve just six months?
Mark Kilgallon responded a veteran would have served six months of active duty, which is the minimum,
that the County is looking for.
Commissio ner Maldonado asked what is the definition of " active duty"?
Comm issioner Hansen stated that "active duty" is a well-defined tenn under the Federal Statutes, and it
incorporates someone in the service who is there twenty-four hours a day at the behest of that service. He
further said the type of service can be in the reserves where one only trains two days out of a month or on
a weekend. Further, he stated that "active duty" does not depend on conflict, it depends on whether or not
one is subordinate to the military force and under their command twenty-four hours a day.
