ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT
Cash Needs
Mr. Walsh reviewed the cash withdrawals for the month of February 2017.
Disability Service Rule
Mr. Walsh reported on some of the follow-up actions that Fund staff has taken related to the Board’s prior directive
regarding granting of service credit to members who are eligible but did not apply for disability benefits from the
Fund. He reported on some of the outcomes from a recent meeting between Fund staff and the City of Chicago’s
Committee on Finance. He noted the following:
1.

2.

The Committee on Finance may allow the LABF to add some additional information about applying for
disability benefits with the City pension Funds to a Committee on Finance letter that is sent out to City of
Chicago employees who are injured on the job.
The Committee on Finance may allow the Fund to obtain electronic reports listing employees of the City of
Chicago who have recently been approved to receive Workman’s Compensation benefits. With this
information, LABF may be able to proactively contact these employees to explain the need to apply for
disability benefits with LABF.

Mr. Walsh also reported that Fund staff is preparing a Duty Disability brochure that they plan to distribute to various
City of Chicago departments which can be used to inform employees of the steps required to apply for and receive
disability benefits from the LABF. He also noted that LABF staff plans to produce posters containing information
regarding LABF’s duty disability benefits that can be distributed for use by various City departments.
In addition, the Trustees continued to discuss some of the possible administrative practices that may be adopted by
the Fund in order to make disability benefits administration more clearly defined for staff and for members. The
Trustees wanted some more time to think about some of the additional issues surrounding this matter and requested
to continue this discussion at a future meeting.
Legislative Matters
Mr. Walsh reviewed the status of Senate Bill 2437, which would place funding for the LABF and MEABF on an
actuarial basis and an identical bill, Senate Bill 14. SB 2437 passed the General Assembly during the previous
legislative session and is awaiting action by the Governor; and SB 14 has passed the Senate in the current session.
Mr. Walsh and the Trustees discussed options for clarifying the legislation should it become law such as adopting
certain “administrative rules” or working to have clarifying legislation introduced. Mr. Walsh also provided
Trustees with a copy of a memo prepared by the Fund’s legislative Liaison.
City Retiree Healthcare
Mr. Walsh updated the Trustees on the status of annuitants who had signed up for City of Chicago retiree healthcare
benefits through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. He noted that some of the annuitants were reaching the end of

7

the grace period for returning their “Assignment Form” to the Fund. Mr. Walsh informed the Trustees that Fund
staff would continue to reach out to these individuals in an attempt to obtain the signed authorization forms.
However, Mr. Walsh also explained Blue Cross Blue Shield’s 90-day delinquency process and informed that Board
that the delinquency process would soon begin for those annuitants, if any, that fail to submit the “Assignment
Form” by the end of the grace period.
Miscellaneous
Calibre CPA Group – Mr. Walsh reviewed a letter to the Board from Calibre CPA Group, the Fund’s auditor.
Special Investment Meeting – Mr. Walsh reminded the Board of the special investment meeting scheduled for
Thursday, March 2, 2017 at 9:00 at the Fund office to discuss the Investment Consultant Search responses. Mr.
Walsh informed the Trustees that he planned on sending a draft summary of RFP responses to them a few days prior
to the meeting.

LEGAL REPORT
IRS Determination Letter
Mr. Walsh informed Trustees that the Fund had received a favorable IRS Determination Letter issued by the IRS that
is contingent upon the Fund’s adoption of the Second Amended and Restated Policy Regarding IRS Qualification
Requirements for the Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago. It was
