north by a fence line that separates the property to the north. This is not a lane used by
Emergency Vehicles or Police Vehicles. Access to the East and West is closed by DPD. We
would request a closure permit for 3.10.19.

Petition No. 231 Michael E. Williams to outright vacate and subsequently revised to
temporary close Burgess Avenue, 50 feet wide, from Acacia Avenue, 60 feet wide, to the
east-west alley, 18 feet wide, ?rst southuof Lyndon Avenue.
The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility
review) and report. This is our report.

The request is being made by the property owners located on Burgess. The area is subject
to crime, including illegal dumping. The property owners have been issued citations and
charged with the removal of the debris discarded by others. There is also a problem with
stolen cars being stripped and abandoned on the block. The residents would like to improve
A the block and allow only pedestrian traf?c by blocking both ends of the block with planters
4- and maintaining a green space on the block.

The Department of Public Works (DPW) objects to the closure because there are residents
6 serviced with garbage pickup by DPW. There are also concerns regarding access for
?v residents, emergency vehicles, and maintenance vehicles for city-owned lots. Street closure
'__has been an ineffective method for prevention of illegal dumping. DPW will consider

installing surveillance cameras on Burgess, as well as ensuring that the street is regularly
monitored for any necessary debris removal.

 
  
   
 

x" Planning and Development Department objects to the closure. The Department of
Neighborhoods has been contacted and will follow-up with the petitioner to address the
dumping issue in the neighborhood. supports addressing this important issue, but
does not support the street closure.

The request was approved by all other involved City Departments and utility companies
provided that easement access the full width of the street is reserved.

Whereas, The Flaming and Development Department objects to the closure;
and the Department of Neighborhoods has been contacted and will follow-up with the
petitioner to address the dumping issue in the neighborhood; Now, Therefore, Be It

RESOLVED, that The Detroit City Council accepts the ?ndings and recommendation of

Avenue, 50 feet wide, from Acacia Avenue, 60 feet wide to the east-west alley, 18 feet

Petition #231

Rebuttal to statements directed to PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDING by Ron
Brundage, Director, D.P.W. Saskia Thompson, Director, Detroit Land Bank Authoii?ty, and Corporation?s
Council, Bryan Amman, Director of Strategic Structures. Statements made 4, 2019, 10:30 am.
by the aforementioned were substantially inaccurate and therefore council members would be unable
to make an informed decision about this petition.

Director Brundage: Petition #231 is for a street vacation.

Rebuttal: The petition is for a semi-permanent closure of the street. It would be placed under study by
the Traffic Engineering Department for either continuation of closure or re-opening within a
predetermined period. Mr. Amman explained the distinction between a Temporary Closure, Semi
Permanent Closure and a Street Vacation. The title of this petition is clearly requesting a ?Semi
Permanent Closure.?

Director Brundage: I am unaware of the frequency of illegal dumping in the petitioner?s area since the
meeting on January 14, 2019

Rebuttal: Illegal dumping has been pervasive throughout the Brightmoor community for years. The
occasions that I have witnessed, have been followed with photographic proof text messaged to Mr.
Dayo Okinyemi, Deputy Director of D.P.W., LaTrice McClendon, Deputy District Manager, District One,
Rebecca McKay, Detroit Police Lieutenant, Officers Arnold and Timothy Cox, D.P.D. plus three owners of
property on the Burgess Street block in petitioner?s request. The issue has been well documented
through stories presented by WDIV Channel 4?s Karen Drew as well as reporters from channels 2 and 7.

if Mr. Brundage is unaware, he need only check his department?s or the media, or the
Department of Administrative Hearings, or with Blight Taskforce.

Director Brundage: I met with Mr. Williams in my office sometime in late September of 2018. 
addressed his concerns during a conversation that lasted about an hour.

Rebuttal: The first time I spoke with Mr. Brundiage was in the corridor adjacent to council's boardroom
on Monday 14 January, 2019. Council Chairman Benson directed Mr. Brundage to engage in a
conversation with me. Mr. Brundage?s voicemail was not set-up and no return phone calls were ever

placed.

Director Brundage: My department is willing to increase the frequency of collections of illegally
discarded debris on Burgess Street.

Rebuttal: Why continue to extend an invitation to those individuals or companies intent on dumping
illegally in our city; in my neighborhood? To increase the frequency of collections will only encourage
the Bad Behavior and squanders tax payer?s dollars and city resources. Let?s put an end to this behavior,
arrest the perpetrators and hold them financially responsible for their actions. Property owners are

threatened with a fine of up to $10,000 for blight dumped on their property by other people. Assess
these fines to the individuals responsible and use the revenue to further purchase additional
surveillance equipment and mitigate the cost to the city for clean?up of affected areas.

Director Brundage: Mr. Williams does not have the support of other neighbors and property owners
on Burgess Street, nor does he have the support of other stakeholders like private utilities and/or
public departments. Additionally the Detroit land Bank Authority owns 75% of the properties on the
street. This is one of but not the only reason that our department has rejected his request.

Rebuttal: Within sixty days of the petition filing, Stakeholders, A.T. T, Comcast, DTE, (Michcon and
Detroit Edison), the Detroit Police Department Sixth Precinct and the Detroit Fire Department
responded with ?No Objections.? Since that time eight other city departments had responded with
either ?No Objections,? or ?No Holds.? Three individuals listed as the owners of property at the time the
document was initiated placed their signatures on the petition. They are Ronald Wagoner, (one
property), Donating Real Estate Consultants, LLC., (one property), Virginia and Mark Slappey, (two
properties). George McCaldon and Donald Michie are listed as deceased owners of three lots. Michael
Williams, (the petitioner), owns or control ten properties. The balance ofthe property was owned by,
the Detroit Land Bank Authority, the Michigan Land bank Authority, the Detroit Planning and
Development Department or the City of Detroit.

Director Amman: If property owners report illegal dumping to the police department they will be
exonerated from the assessment of fines for blight crimes.

Rebuttal: I have for more than two years reported illegal dumping to the aforementioned individuals.
Each time was told by the supervisors at the Department of Public Works, that the property owner is
responsible for cleaning blight on their respective properties. When presenting my cases to the
inspectors and supervisors from BSEED, the exact same sentiment was conveyed. ?Property Owners Are
Responsible For Blight On Their Property.? Director Amman spoke about the ordinance in his address to
the committee.

On August 8, 2018 I received two blight tickets for debris illegally dumped on the curb of one of my
properties. Pursuant to November 9, 2018 session with the Department of Administrative Hearings, I
was found and ordered to pay $330.00 in fines. Additionally I was reported to the
Wayne County Treasurer?s office, which placed a hold on deeds to properties I purchased in
the October 2018 auction.

Director Amman: A vacation of a street occurs when the petitioner takes full responsibility and
ownership of the property. It is like creating a private thoroughfare.

Rebuttal: This petition is not asking that the street to be It is asking for a TEMPORARY
closure.

Director Thompson: am not aware if Mr. Williams has worked with the Detroit Land Bank
Authority. I cannot make a decision on the sale of property. That is done by a committee. There is no
short term plan for the area involved in this petition.

Rebuttal: She may not be aware of my attempts to purchase and I am unaware of the length of her
tenure with the authority. I have worked with members of the purchase team since 2016.
Reassignment and personnel turnover in that department has been frequent. I have worked for months
with individuals to acquire lots only to be placed with a newly incoming replacement team-member.
This causes the purchase process start from the beginning. Often I have been told by ?the Team? that
some target parcels not currently listed through the Land Bank will be offered to the adjacent property
owner once available. I have also been told by the land bank?s "Side Lot? team, that several
properties on Burgess street listed on the city?s website as being Land Bank owned was not controlled
by the authority.

I have offered to maintain the common areas between Lyndon and Acacia on Burgess Street, build a
park like setting on my property, place public seating (benches) through the common areas and create
an environment that will benefit the community and put an end to illegal activity. I will at me expense
place collapsible barricade on the opposing ends of the block. I ask only that this council see the benefit
to my petition and grant me the opportunity to proceed at the direction of and in accordance with the
departments involved.

Thank you,

Michael Williams

Council on September 24. 2018, denying this request to lave Burgess closed. The




detennined that over 80% (30 individual lots) of the impacted prtperties are owned by the
Detroit Land Bank (see attached). The petitioner has not received support from the Land
Bank to close public access to this street. At minimum, approval from 28 of the abutting
prolaerty owners is required before DPW can consider the potential closing of a public road
oralley.

The Department acknowledges Mr. Williams concerns of illegal dumping, as well as other
inappropriate activities that have occurred on Burgess. as well as other streets in the
neighborlnod. We are inspecting these streets on regular intervals. with a commitment to
quickly clear illegally dumped debris when it occurs. We are also considering this location
for surveillance cameras. however we cannot state if or when these cameras would be
installed. We remain willing to work with concerned citizens such as Mr. Williams. to come
up with a plan that effectively addresses the concerns of the neighborhood.

We the owners of properties located on Burgess Street, addresses between 14300 and 14430 requests a
permit to semi permanently close this street to vehicular traffic. We also ask that the city?s land
development department initiate a study to consider a permanent closure.

For several years this street has been an attractive nuisance for crime and illegal dumping. Often we the
property owners are targeted, issued citations for and charged with the responsibility of removing
debris discarded by other. There is constantly a stream of stolen automobiles transported to this stretch
of roadway to be stripped and discarded.

We feel that the best way to combat or curtail this illegal activity is to close the street to automobile
traffic and restrict access to pedestrians only. We would like to create park-like setting which will
include two large cement plant boxes at each end of the street. The property owner would utilize their
grass spaces to place benches and tables for use by the neighborhood. We will find funding sources or
bear the expense of the closures. The property owners will continue to maintain their respective lots,
and collectively maintain those that belong to the City of Detroit or the Detroit Land Bank Authority.

Attached are recently photographed images of illegally discarded debris. Please take into consideration
this request and notify me of your decision.

Respectfully,

Michael E. Williams

Assessment of Meeting,
Petition #231, Semi?Permanent Street Closure

Burgess Street between Lyndon and Acacia

At a meeting between petitioner and the Detroit Department of Public Works held February 15, 2019.
Present were the following individuals:

Ron Brundage, Director, Department of Public Works

Dayo Akinyemi, Deputy Director, Department of Public Works
Arnold Williams, Commander, Sixth Precinct Police Station

Gary Sroka, Captain, Sixth Precinct Police Station

Saskia Thompson, Executive Director, Detroit Land Bank Authority
Bryan L. Amann, Chief Legal Counsel-Capital Infrastructure
Derron Jones, Principal Inspector, Department of Public Works
Miriam Blank?Smart, Director, Department of Hearings and Appeals
Paul Max, General Manager, B.S.E.E.D. Environmental Affairs
James D. Foster, Manager II, Buildings, Safety, Engineering and Environmental Department
Ray Solomon, Manager, Department of Neighborhoods

Kya Robertson, Deputy District Manager- District 1

TOPIC:

While addressing City Council Members, Scott Benson, Janee' Ayers and Roy McCalisterJr., on Friday
February 4, 2019, Ron Brundage presented reasons for his department?s objections to the petition. His
major concern; ?Petitioner is not the majority owner of property on the street of proposed closure.? ?He
does not have consent from the other property owners and stakeholders.? He indicated that Detroit Land
bank Authority owned two thirds of the forty properties on the block. A subsequent concern was that
history has shown ?Street Closures,? are ineffective at preventing illegal dumping. Furthermore,
?Permitting the petitioner to close the street will set an unwelcome precedent.?

CONTENT:

Present during the meeting was Saskia Thompson of the DLBA. When presented with the facts by the
petitioner, Miss Thompson stated that the DLBA is not opposed to nor would they stand in the way of
allowing a temporary closure. However, the DLBA would have to preserve their rights if the petition was
seeking a permanent closure. Additionally, she stated that she would investigate the procedure for and
seek to work with Mr. Williams (petitioner) to facilitate the sale of any Land Bank owned property within
the project area. Note: This petition is seeking a temporary closure.

I21 CLERK 20 FEB 1131'? F't-i'iHEEl

Also present during the meeting was Mr. Arnold Williams, Commander of the Sixth Police Precinct. Mr.
Williams? tenure with the post began approximately six months ago. He was informed that when the
petition was initiated, his precinct submitted a response of to the City Clerk's Office.
Commander Williams stated during the meeting, that he would not have any objections to allowing the
closure.

Bryan Amann of the city?s law department gave information about the distinction between a temporary
closure, Semi Permanent Closure and Street Vacation. He noted the absence of a representative of the
Department of Parks Recreation, then offered an opinion as to the legality of placing park seating on
public property. He indicated that what is done on private property would not undergo scrutiny from
the law department and suggested securing additional property from the Land Bank to gain a further
advantage for this project.

Allin attendance agreed that illegal dumping is pervasive on this block and crime such as drug usage and
prostitution is a continuing problem. The topic of a ?Cure without a closure,? was mentioned; however
there was no solution for a resolve, presented. NONE of individuals during the meeting, with the
exception of Mr. Brundage, verbally expressed an opposition to proceeding with the petition?s request.
One person applied the notion that the petitioner, (Mr. Williams), was a for the work he had
previously done to make this area better and safer for its neighbors.

James Foster of the B.S.E.E.D. verbalized that there need to be a solution and perhaps his team could
work with the petitioner and coordinate or participate in a beautification project on the block. Pursuant
to a phone call the next day, he stated that a follow-up conversation with Mr. Brundage would be
necessary before he could give an actual opinion on the matter. He also stated that he had not been
made aware of the petition prior to the meeting.

Ray Solomon thanked the petitioner for boarding up properties in his former district and offered to
assist, alongside LaTrice McClendon, District Manager for District 1 with further cleanup,.

A temporary closure would give the city access to valuable data gathered at the property owner?s
expense. Data that could be analyzed over a predetermined period of time and yielding a decision to
either; continue with a temporary closure, convert to a permanent closure or re-open the street to
public access.

Given this information, ask that this subcommittee allow the petition to go before the full council for
consideration and a vote.

Thank you.

REFERRED TO THE FOLLOWING 

PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT DPW -
CITY ENGINEERING DIVISION

BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF HOUSE BILL 4053

WHEREAS, On January 16, 2019, Michigan House Representative Steve Marino (R),
introduced House Bill 405 3, which is now in the House Local Government and Municipal
Finance Committee awaiting deliberation; and

WHEREAS, In 2013 the Disabled Veterans Exemption statutory amendment (MCL 211.7b) was
enacted by the entire legislature to give homestead property tax exemptions for fully disabled
veterans who were honorably discharged from the armed forces or their surviving spouse if they
have not remarried. Unfortunately, however, spouses of soldiers who were killed while in
combat were inadvertently excluded from this bene?t, because their spouse was not technically a
veteran at the time of death; and

WHEREAS, House Bill 4053, addresses this loophole in state law and bridges this unintentional
gap, by expanding the property tax exemption to include the surviving spouse of service
members who were killed during active duty, as long as the spouse remains unmarried; and

WHEREAS, The Detroit City Council ?rmly believes that any effort that honors our veterans
and their families should be supported, particularly when efforts are made for those who have
made the ultimate sacri?ce for the safety and freedoms that all citizens of the United States of
America enjoy. Disabled veterans, as well as their spouses need assistance to provide a
comfortable transition back into civilian life. This amendment will enhance this transition; NOW
THEREFORE BE IT.

RESOLVED, The Detroit City Council enthusiastically supports and recommends passage of
House Bill 4053, in order to provide a homestead property tax exemption to the spouses of fallen
soldiers who died in combat or from service connected injuries; BE IT FURTHER

RESOLVED, The Detroit City Clerk is directed to send copies of the resolution to the House
Local Government and Municipal Finance Committee, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the Detroit
delegation in the State House, and the Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.

RESOLUTION TO CREATE AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL TASK FORCE ON
MARATHON PETROLEUM DETROIT REFINERY AND SIMILAR
ESTABLISHMENTS FOR COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE HEALTH
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATION OF SUCH ESTABLISHMENTS

By Council President Brenda Jones

WHEREAS, On Saturday, February 2, 2019, the Marathon Petroleum Detroit re?nery experienced
an incident and condition in which ?aring of chemicals containing sulfur created a severe,
extremely nauseating rotten egg?type odor that affected several communities throughout
southeastern Michigan, including the City of Detroit; and

WHEREAS, Although Marathon?s internal investigation and multiple governmental
investigations are still ongoing, and Marathon has yet to of?cially state the cause and origin of this
incident, fence line communities near this re?nery have long been concerned about its effects on
their quality of life and health; and

WHEREAS, It is already clear that there was grossly insuf?cient communication to the public at
the time of the incident. Community members suffered from widespread, sickening odors, but
they received only the unclear, but frightening sound of emergency sirens, followed some time
later by vague assurances that there was allegedly no serious or signi?cant health problem caused
by this incident, an assertion that seems inconsistent with a large number of persons who
complained about being sickened by the incident; and

WHEREAS, In an attempt to upgrade and improve transparency, equity, public oversight and
overall quality of life and health for residents of southeastern Michigan who are affected by
facilities and incidents like this one, Detroit City Council calls for the formation of an
intergovernmental task force with representation of City, County, State and Federal of?cials, as
well as trusted community advocates, to better monitor such facilities and incidents, and to provide
signi?cantly improved information to the public in the event of such signi?cant emissions events;
and

WHEREAS, The Great Lakes Water Authority recently upgraded its public noti?cation processes
in the event of water main breaks, resulting in the much wider and timelier distribution of relevant
and accurate information in the event of such incidents. Government agencies in southeastern
Michigan, as well as Marathon Petroleum Corp., should obtain, study and to the extent feasible
adopt similar public noti?cation protocols, procedures and requirements concerning major air
pollution incidents like this one; and

WHEREAS, Beyond the issue of public information in the event of particular air pollution
emergencies, there are signi?cant opportunities to increase public oversight of daily activities of
the Marathon re?nery and similar establishments, to improve their performance as good corporate
neighbors and citizens, and to improve quality of life and health in host communities throughout
southeastern Michigan; and

LPD DRAFT 02 15 19

WHEREAS, Mere compliance with the speci?c health-based air pollution control environmental
standards imposed by federal and state laws on such facilities is not fully adequate to protect public
health, environmental quality and quality of life in all host communities, especially communities
populated by large numbers of People of Color, who have long faced severe, adverse and
disproportionately high environmental and public health risks from nearby industries; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT THE Council urges the Mayor of the City of
Detroit to facilitate the City of Detroit, Wayne County, the State of Michigan and the United States
federal government designation of quali?ed of?cials to meet and function as an intergovernmental
task force on urban air pollution, with the goal of establishing better communication, more public
awareness, and improved public policies for oversight of major air pollution sources in
southeastern Michigan, including but not limited to the Marathon Detroit re?nery; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT Copies of this resolution will be provided to Wayne
County Executive Warren Evans, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the Director of the
Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Director of the United
States Environmental Protection Agency, members of the Detroit delegation in the State
Legislature, and members of the Michigan delegation in Congress.
