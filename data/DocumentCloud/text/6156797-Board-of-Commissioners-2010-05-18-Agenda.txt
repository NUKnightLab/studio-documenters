PRESIDENT
VETO
ITEM #1
RECEIVED AND FILED
Transmitting a Communication, dated May, 10, 2010 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Please be advised, that in accordance with the authority granted to me by Section 2-6008 of the Counties
Code and for the reasons stated herein, I hereby veto substitute New Item #6 passed by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners on May 4, 2010 wherein the County Board mandated a salary and hiring freeze
through November 30, 2010 for all County Offices.
In accordance with Section 2-6008, I hereby transmit my veto of substitute New Item #6 approved on
May 4, 2010 and request that this veto message be placed on the County Board Meeting Agenda for the
next meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, May 18, 2010.
The substitute New Item #6 passed on May 4, 2010 by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
requires the following: (1) hiring freeze on vacant positions, i.e., any position (not otherwise excluded)
that is or becomes vacant during the effective period of the Ordinance shall remain vacant; (2) prohibits
salary increases for current County employees (excluding positions under the jurisdiction of a judicial
mandate and the Cook County Health & Hospitals System) without County Board approval; (3) requires
Board approval for any hiring, transfer, reclassification of positions, and salary adjustments that would
increase the expenditure amounts of budget lines for costs related to current staff; and (4) in the event of
an emergency request to hire, transfer, reclassify or institute a salary adjustment, Board approval is
required.
This May 4, 2010 Ordinance passed by the County Board violates the statutory and Constitutional
authority of the President of the Cook County Board and the Office of the Chief Executive; furthermore,
this Ordinance passed by the Cook County Board is an unconstitutional attempt to alter the form of
county government.
The Illinois Constitution states that the Chief Executive Officer shall have those duties and powers
provided by law and those provided by county ordinance. Illinois Const. 1970, Article VII, Sect. 4(a).
Under Illinois Statute, the County Board President, i.e., the Chief Executive Officer, has the power to
appoint all officers and employees of the county of Cook, except those whose election or appointment is
otherwise provided for law. 55 ILCS 5/3-14001.

PRESIDENT continued
VETO continued
ITEM #1 cont’d
The power to hire and fire employees affected by the May 4, 2010 Ordinance vests with the President and
the passage of an Ordinance instituting a hiring freeze and requiring Board approval prior to hiring or
appointing an individual to a vacant position, transferring a current employee to a different position or
reclassifying an employee is unconstitutional. The actions by the Board of Commissioners on May 4,
2010 alters the current “form of government” that provides the President with the authority to hire and
fire and institutes a change without referendum approval in violation of the Illinois Constitution. Illinois
Const. 1970, Article VII, Section 6(f).
This is not the first attempt by the County Board of Commissioners to limit the statutory and
Constitutional authority of the President; however, like previous cases, this alteration is being attempted
in an invalid manner and is in violation of the law. Under a previous administration, the County Board
of Commissioners passed a resolution that allowed the Commissioners to hire certain staff and approve or
disapprove the expenditures made in connection with the compensation of the employees affected by the
employee resolution. See, Dunne v. The County of Cook et al., 164 Ill.App.3d 929 (First District, 1987).
In Dunne, the Appellate Court affirmed the Circuit Court’s finding that the power to hire and fire the
employees in question was vested in the executive officer of Cook County by statute and the resolution
approved by the Board was a change in the form of county government, without referendum approval, in
violation of the Illinois Constitution. Dunne v. The County of Cook et al., 164 Ill.App.3d 929 (First
District, 1987). Like Dunne, on May 4, 2010, the County Board of Commissioners violated the statutory
and Constitutional authority of the chief executive officer when it prevented, prohibited and limited the
hiring authority of the President on multiple levels.
The May 4, 2010 action by the County Board in passing substitute New Item #6 changes the form of
County government without a referendum and in violation of the law. This action by the County Board is
in violation of both statutory and Constitutional authority. For this reason, I urge you to reconsider your
support of substitute New Item #6.

ITEM #3 cont’d
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power
and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and other departments and
constitutional offices of the county of Cook have been under a federal Shakman Consent
Decree in regards to political influence in the hiring, firing, promotion, and/or demotion
of county career service employees; and
WHEREAS, the cook county taxpayers are forced to bear an unnecessary financial
burden of approximately ten million dollars for the cost of, including but not limited to,
Shakman administrators, salaries, support staff and lawsuit payouts; and
WHEREAS, we can no longer afford to pay the cost for unfair employment practices
therefore it is essential that we move forward to comply with the consent decree by
seeking employment and recruitment alternatives that would minimize political influence
and ensure greater transparency and public trust.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners create an ad hoc committee made up of one Commissioner from
the Workforce, Job Development & Training Committee, one Commissioner from the
Finance Committee and representatives from the following: Civic Federation, Cook
County Sheriff’s Office, Cook County Comptroller, Cook County Forest Preserve
District, Cook County Human Resources, Cook County Recorder of Deeds and industrial
engineers, to retrieve information from all departments on current expenditures pertaining
to the cost associated with remaining under the Shakman Decree, including but not
limited to monitoring, lawsuit payouts, cost of investigations, staffing and salaries.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the ad hoc committee conduct an in-house
feasibility study for the following: (1) cost analysis of entering into an agreement with an
independent recruiting agency either on an as needed basis or contractually, (2)
comparative analysis of the cost of hiring an independent recruiting agency verses the
cost of remaining under the Shakman consent decree, and (3) an estimate of future
workforce needs taking into account retirement, budgetary constraints, and other factors
that influence the size of the workforce. The findings from the feasibility study shall be
tendered to the Cook County Board of Commissioners no later than September 1, 2010.

RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called one of our Nation’s most spectacular and
treasured performing artists, Lena Horne from our midst; and
WHEREAS, at the tender age of 16, Ms. Horne joined the chorus of the Cotton Club in New York City;
on the heels of this nightclub performance she toured the United States successfully with several
bandleaders and their orchestras; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Horne became the first African American performer to sign a long-term contract with a
major Hollywood studio; Ms. Horne became famous in 1943 for her rendition of the title song in the film,
“Stormy Weather”; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Horne withstood significant discrimination as a film actress; for example, she was
never featured in a leading role due to the fact that films featuring her had to be re-edited for showing in
states where theaters would not show films with African American performers; additionally she lost a
reprisal of the female lead part in the film, “Show Boat,” due to the Production Code’s ban on interracial
relationships in film; and

LISA M. WALIK, Director, Department of Risk Management
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Caremark, LLC,
Northbrook, Illinois, for Pharmacy Benefit Management Services.
Reason:

The Department of Risk Management is requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to
enter into a contract with Caremark, LLC ("Caremark"). By exercising this authority,
Caremark has agreed to implement an early pricing improvement retroactive May 1, 2010, as
opposed to the contract anniversary date of December 1, 2010. By installing this pricing
improvement seven months early, Cook County will save approximately $2,700,000.00 from
May 1, 2010 through November 30, 2010. Additionally, Cook County will also save an
estimated $16,900,000.00 based on the current utilization and plan design from December 1,
2010 through November 30, 2013 with the improved negotiated pricing and rebate structure.
The purpose is to provide eligible Cook County employees and their eligible dependents with
prescription drug benefits for retail and mail-order services as part of the fringe benefits
offered to employees.
The County of Cook, together with the City of Chicago, Chicago Public Schools, City
Colleges of Chicago, Chicago Transit Authority and Chicago Park District (collectively,
“Agencies”) participated in a request for proposal for pharmacy management benefits this fall.
The Chicago Public Schools managed the documentation and much of the work needed to
effectively negotiate this new agreement from October 2009 through April 2010. The County
of Cook can now take advantage of Caremark’s offer to implement enhanced pricing May 1,
2010 as opposed to December 1, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact*: $140,400,000.00 (FY 2011 - $48,300,000.00; FY 2012 - $47,000,000.00; and
FY 2013 - $45,100,000.00). Contract period: December 1, 2010 through November 30, 2013, with two
(2) one-year renewal options. (490-176, 499-176 and 899-176 Accounts). Requisition No. 04900003.
* To be charged to the following accounts 490-176, 499-176 and 899-176 based actual utilization
incurred on a monthly basis.

LISA M. WALIK, Director, Department of Risk Management
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Fort Dearborn Life
Insurance Company, Chicago, Illinois, to provide eligible Cook County employees with basic and

Aetna Life Insurance Company, Fort Dearborn Life Insurance, Guardian Life Insurance
Company of America, MetLife (Metropolitan Life Insurance Company) and Prudential
Insurance Company of America. While the contract period is for three (3) years, with two (2)
one-year renewal options, Fort Dearborn Life Insurance Company has guaranteed the monthly
premium rates for the five-year period. Based on the negotiated premium, the County will
realize savings of approximately $725,000.00 for the remainder of the fiscal year, and
annualized savings of approximately of $1,450,000.00 based on the current in force rates.

Estimated Fiscal Impact*: $10,800,000.00 (FY 2010 - $1,800,000.00; FY 2011 - $3,600,000.00; FY
2012 - $3,600,000.00; and FY 2013 - $1,800,000.00). Contract period: June 1, 2010 through May 31,
2013. (490-175, 499-175 and 899-175 Accounts). Requisition No. 04900002.
* The estimated fiscal impact is based on current enrollment and salaries. The cost of this benefit has a
direct relationship to the salaries of eligible employees and is subject to change based on scheduled salary
increases and the outcome of labor negotiations. Therefore, the fiscal impact is subject to increase
accordingly. Based on these factors, sufficient funds will be budgeted for each fiscal year.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2011, 2012, and 2013 funds.

ITEM #19 cont’d
In December 2009, the Chief Financial Officer for Cook County agreed to advance fund the Office of the
Public Defender and the Office of the Chief Judge in order to pay our outstanding obligations. The
County will be reimbursed when the funds are received from the State of Illinois. The State’s Attorney’s
Office already has a process by which its capital litigation expenses are paid from a County account and
the County is reimbursed when funds from the State of Illinois are received.
The purpose of this letter is to respectfully request the County allow the Office of the Public Defender and
the Office of the Chief Judge to continue to use the accounts that have been established by the County to
pay our service providers. Both officers agree not to exceed the approved grant amounts of $2.7 million
for the Office of the Public Defender and $2.0 million for the Office of the Chief Judge. Absent State of
Illinois funding, the County must unfortunately bear the costs of litigation for indigents, in capital cases,
as it did before the advent of the fund.

CONTRACTS continued
ITEM #25 cont’d
Reason:

This firm is being recommended because they were the previous vendor who was selected
through the issuance of the Request for Proposal (RFP) process. They began work based
upon Board authorization prior to the project being cancelled. The firm previously completed
22% of the design documents which includes: site visits, meetings with Cook County
agencies, coordination with the City of Chicago Department of Buildings, Topographical
Survey, Program Analysis Report and Schematic Design Drawings prior to the project being
cancelled last year. In addition, this vendor is recommended because reissuing the Request
for Proposal would cause a lengthy seasonal delay in the completion of the project and it is
beneficial to the project to maintain the inherent ‘lessons learned’ and program continuity.
The parking lot is in disrepair and is presenting unsightly conditions. The intent of the project
was for the paved lot to be completed before the start of heavy construction traffic caused by
the work performed from the renovation portion of the warehouse interior and the exterior
wall repair projects.
The Hawthorne Warehouse is located in a high crime area and the safety and security of the
grounds would be significantly improved with the addition of the high mast lighting and
entrance control. This is especially critical during election periods as the grounds are
accessible 24 hours per day.
This is categorized as a renovation project.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $284,302.70. Bond Issue (20000 Account).

TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
Pursuant to General Administrative Order 2010-01, the Cook County Board of Commissioners is
requested to approve a payment of $200,000.00 to the Center for Conflict Resolution, Chicago, Illinois
(the Center), payable from the Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Fund, County Fund 531.
Reason:

The Center was the only qualifying applicant for these funds in 2009.

The payment will have no fiscal impact on Cook County. By statute, fees from civil filings are collected
solely for this purpose. There are sufficient funds available in 531-818 Account, Reimbursement to
Designated Fund, for this purpose.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $200,000.00. (531-818 Account).
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS
GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 2010-01
SUBJECT: ILLINOIS NOT-FOR-PROFIT DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT
Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (710 ILCS 20/1 et seq.), the Clerk
of the Circuit Court of Cook County has collected fees from civil filings for disbursement to the Dispute
Resolution Centers which qualify under said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook
County. Fees available for disbursement from this Fund for the year 2009 total $266,976.00.
Upon review of applications received for funds collected in 2009, the sole qualifying applicant
under the requirements set forth in said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook County
was found to be the Center for Conflict Resolution. It is eligible for the maximum amount allowable for
disbursement to any Dispute Resolution Center in a given year of $200,000.00.
Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (710 ILCS 20/1 et seq.), any funds
collected but not disbursed in a given year shall be paid in single county judicial circuits to the County
Treasurer for the administration of justice in the judicial circuit. An amount of $66,976.00 remains
collected for the year 2009 but no other Dispute Resolution Center is qualified to receive disbursement of
these funds.
Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the amount of $200,000.00, representing the maximum
amount allowable for disbursement to any Dispute Resolution Center in a given year, shall be disbursed
to the Center for Conflict Resolution.
Further, it hereby ordered that the amount of $66,976.00 representing funds collected under the
Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act for 2009 but not disbursed shall be paid to the Treasurer of
Cook County for the administration of justice in the Circuit Court of Cook County.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #28
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE #306656
Transmitting a Communication, dated April 15, 2010 from
DOROTHY BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $100,000.00 from Account
335-240, Printing and Publishing to Account 335-120, Overtime Compensation for Circuit Court Clerks'
overtime compensation.
Reason:

Funds are needed to accommodate necessary overtime expenses for court clerks when court
proceedings extend beyond regular working hours, as well as for court clerks working the
bond courts on weekends. Accumulated comp-time was paid out of the overtime account to
employees that retired/resigned during the fiscal year.
This issue was mentioned during the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office Budget Presentation,
when questions were raised by one of the Commissioners. In response, the Acting Chief
Human Resources Officer explained that the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office was addressing
the need to reduce the amount of overtime by changing shifts for court clerks. He also
explained that making changes such as these and adjusting the positions must be done in
compliance with the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office Collective Bargaining Agreement. In
three (3) operational areas, court clerk positions were posted with adjusted work schedules
with hours from noon to 8 p.m. establishing work weeks of Tuesday through Saturday and
Wednesday through Sunday.
These adjustments were posted for bids in late February and, consistent with the Collective
Bargaining Agreement, the jobs should be awarded within the next thirty days. By adjusting
work schedules during the February posting and adding more positions for adjustment later in
FY 2010, the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office anticipates significant reductions in overtime.
Because of the time it takes to implement these types of changes, there remains a need for
additional funds for overtime compensation at this time.
In addition, accumulated comp-time was paid out of the overtime account to employees that
retired/resigned during the Fiscal Year.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS continued
ITEM #28 cont’d
The Clerk of the Circuit Court Office was aware of the need to address consistent accumulation
of overtime by court clerks who are required to remain in court while court calls are pending
either during lunch or after regular work hours. Overtime is also accrued on Saturdays and
Sundays and holidays by court clerks who are required to work bond court. As a result,
additional funding is needed to compensate court clerks for the overtime hours worked.
On March 31, 2010, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations. At that time, the balance in the account was $6,854.15
and 30 days prior to that the balance in the account was $56,232.47.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 240-Printing and Publishing was identified as the source of the transferred funds as the
account received reimbursement for the printing costs of Personal Issue Tickets (Traffic Citation
Tickets) for the City of Chicago Police and the various Suburban Police Agencies.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from Account 335-240.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Printing costs for Personal Issue Tickets are now being appropriately charged to the using
agencies (City of Chicago Police and Suburban Police Agencies), hence, the availability of funds
for transfer.
