ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT

LABF Financing Request (Tax Levy)
Mr. Walsh reported that he and Trustee Roa attended a meeting with the City of Chicago’s Budget Director
and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other key personnel from the City’s Office of Budget and
Management, Department of Finance and Department of Law, on February 20, 2019, to discuss the
historical contribution shortfalls attributable to losses associated with property tax collections. Mr. Walsh
explained to the Board the historical and statutory context for LABF’s position that it should not be required
to absorb losses associated with the property tax collections (see attached letter).
Mr. Walsh conveyed the City’s position, presented by its Chief Financial Officer, that the “dynamic”
funding mechanism created by the enactment of Public Act 100-0023 renders the property tax collection
loss a moot point. He explained that representatives from the City’s Law Department asked that LABF
wait until there is a resolution in the Firemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago’s (the “FABF”)
lawsuit regarding a similar matter before taking any further action.
Mr. Walsh explained that he had briefed Fund Counsel regarding the meeting with the City and that he and
counsel had discussed several possible courses of action. Mr. Walsh recommended certifying the
contribution shortfall amount to the State Comptroller in an attempt to intercept State monies flowing to
the City. He noted that utilizing the intercept provision built into the Illinois Pension Code protects the
Trustees from a fiduciary standpoint and that this option may allow the Fund to collect the shortfalls in the
most efficient and economic manner. The Trustees and Mr. Walsh discussed how to quantify the amount to
be certified. Mr. Burns suggested that the Board pass a motion approving this approach.
This motion was taken out of order. It was moved by Trustee Capasso, seconded by Trustee LoVerde, to
use the intercept provision to recover the shortfall in contributions from the City of Chicago.
Roll-call:

For -- Trustees Roa, LoVerde, Hamburger, Capasso and Joiner.
Against – None.

Public Act 100-0023 Employer Contribution Mechanics
This item was taken out of order and discussed in executive session.
EXECUTIVE SESSION NO. 1
At 2:25 p.m., Trustee LoVerde requested an executive session under 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(11) to discuss
pending or probable litigation against, affecting or on behalf of the Fund. Trustee Capasso seconded the
motion.
Roll-call:

For -- Trustees Roa, Keane, LoVerde, Hamburger, Capasso and Joiner.
Against -- None

Trustee Keane left after the roll call.
At 3:20 pm, Trustee LoVerde made a motion, seconded by Trustee Hamburger that the executive session
be adjourned and that the Board return to open session.
Roll-call:

For -- Trustees Roa, LoVerde, Hamburger, Capasso and Joiner.
Against -- None

Legislative Matters
Senate Bill 1264 – By way of background, Mr. Walsh explained that prior to the enactment of certain 2017
legislation amending Illinois’ Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, the Fund had been exempt from
having to escheat abandoned funds to the State; however, the 2017 legislation purportedly eliminated such
exemption.
Senate Bill 1264, introduced on February 6, 2019, would amend the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property
Act to exempt certain retirement systems from having to escheat certain unclaimed property to the State of
Illinois, but would still require that such retirement systems report the “abandoned” property to the State
Treasurer’s Office. Mr. Walsh explained that escheated property in the State of Illinois is ultimately used
to subsidize the State retirement systems, particularly SURS, and that it made no sense to send LABF assets
to the State. Mr. Walsh noted that the State Treasurer’s Office indicated that they wanted to be comfortable
that LABF is making a reasonable effort to contact the owners of the unclaimed property, or their heirs,
prior to supporting LABF’s exemption from the escheatment requirement. Mr. Walsh suggested sending
the State of Illinois Treasurer’s Office a document which outlines LABF’s processes and procedures for
locating missing participants who are owed a benefit or refund. The Trustees supported sending a letter to
the State Treasurer’s Office in an effort to be included in SB 1264.
Trustee LoVerde suggested that the Fund adopt a formal policy for locating lost participants. Mr. Burns
offered to provide Mr. Walsh with other required minimum distribution and lost payee policies as samples
that will help with the creation of internal policies.
Statement of Economic Interest – This item was taken out of order. Mr. Carroll let the Trustees know that the
Statement of Economic Interest filings are due by May 1, 2019.
LEGAL REPORT
Mr. Walsh referred the Trustees to a memo prepared by Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP summarizing the
status of ongoing litigation matters.
In the Underwood matter, Mr. Walsh reported that there are still some issues that need to be resolved
regarding the notices that will be sent to members who may be eligible for the healthcare subsidy. He also
7

noted that an issue has arisen regarding the taxability of the healthcare subsidy. Finally, Mr. Walsh
mentioned that Taft Stettinius & Hollister will be seeking guidance from Judge Cohen regarding the
payment of subsidies to the heirs of participants who have died .

ADJOURNMENT
With no further business, at 3:27 PM, Trustee LoVerde made a motion to adjourn the meeting. Trustee
Capasso seconded the motion.

 INTRODUCTION
The Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago (“LABF”) is a singleemployer, defined benefit public pension fund. The LABF was created in 1935 by virtue of an act of the Illinois
General Assembly to provide retirement and disability benefits to its members and their beneficiaries. The LABF is
administered in accordance with the Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/Arts. 1, 1A, 11, 20, and 22) (as amended from
time to time, the “Illinois Pension Code”). The LABF is governed by an eight-member Board of Trustees (the
“Board”).

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
The purpose of this Investment Policy Statement (“IPS” or “Policy”), including the attached Appendices, is to set
forth the Board’s investment objectives, policies, and procedures relating to the investment of the LABF’s assets in
accordance with the Illinois Pension Code. The IPS will define the duties and responsibilities of the Board, acting in
a fiduciary capacity, and of all persons or entities acting on the Board’s behalf. The objectives, policies, and
procedures outlined in this IPS were created as a general framework to guide the management of the LABF. This
Policy replaces and supersedes any and all other LABF policies, resolutions, or practices covering the subject of
investments, whether written or verbal.
This Policy is intended to comply with the provisions of the Illinois Pension Code. In the event of a conflict between
this Investment Policy Statement and the applicable sections of the Illinois Pension Code, the Illinois Pension Code
governs.

FIDUCIARY DUTY
Per the Illinois Pension Code, the Board and certain LABF staff members have a fiduciary obligation to the LABF’s
participants and their beneficiaries. In summary, the provisions of the Illinois Pension Code specifically referring to
the definitions, duties, and responsibilities of a fiduciary are:






a fiduciary is anyone who has discretion in managing pension fund assets or in administering the pension
fund, or who renders investment advice for direct or indirect compensation. [40 ILCS 5/1-101.2]
a fiduciary must discharge its duties to the pension fund for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to
participants and beneficiaries, and defraying reasonable administrative expenses of the pension fund. [40
ILCS 5/1-109(a)]
a fiduciary must discharge its duties to the pension fund with the same care, skill, prudence and diligence
that a prudent person would use in a similar enterprise. [40 ILCS 5/1-109(b)]
a fiduciary must discharge its duties to the pension fund by diversifying the investments to minimize the risk
of large losses, unless prudence dictates otherwise. [40 ILCS 5/1-109(c)]
a fiduciary must discharge its duties to the pension fund in accordance with Articles 1, 1A and 11 of the
Illinois Pension Code. [40 ILCS 5/1-109(d)]
a fiduciary must not cause the pension fund to engage in prohibited transactions. A fiduciary must not deal
with the pension fund’s assets for its own interest, or on behalf of any party whose interests are adverse to
the pension fund or its participants or beneficiaries. [40 ILCS 5/1-110]

Responsibilities of the Transition Managers(s)
Transition managers, acting as fiduciaries, are utilized to transition a portfolio of securities as a result of portfolio
liquidations, investment manager changes, asset allocation shifts, and portfolio rebalancing. Transition management
centralizes the coordination of activities and parties involved with the purpose of eliminating unnecessary transactions,
reducing costs, and maintaining market exposure during the transition period. The transition manager is entrusted to
prudently manage the process.

3

 The LABF utilizes a pool of approved transition managers and reserves the right to select a transition manager outside
of the pool of approved transition managers, as necessary, with the approval of the Board. The LABF may also utilize

etc.).
 Report to the Investment Staff during the transition period regarding trade activity from commencement of
the process to its completion.
 Provide Investment Staff with a post-trade analysis report after the completion of the transition that should
include, at a minimum, the actual explicit costs, implicit costs, and full trading/transaction reports.

LABF’s custodian.

Manage the investment of cash collateral in a manner consistent with the guidelines agreed to by contract
and consistent with the risk/return characteristics of the LABF with the predominant focus being capital
preservation.
Provide necessary reporting on a periodic basis (usually monthly or quarterly) to Investment Staff, investment
consultant(s), and the LABF’s custodian.

Responsibilities of Outside Legal Counsel(s)
As it pertains to investment-related matters, the Board’s outside legal counsel has the following responsibilities:
 Proactively provide the Board and Investment Staff with advice regarding compliance with applicable laws
and regulations.
 Review and provide advice with respect to investment management agreements, limited partnership
agreements, side letters, and other contractual agreements with investment managers.
 Review and provide advice with respect to contracts with investment service providers.
 Provide assistance on an as-needed basis with respect to any other legal matters related to investments.

Responsibilities of the City Treasurer
The Treasurer of the City of Chicago shall be ex-officio treasurer and custodian of the LABF. The Board may
supplement the Treasurer’s responsibility by utilizing the services of a master custodian, or another custodian for a
specific investment, for the safekeeping of cash and securities.

RISK MANAGEMENT
All investment decisions have a risk component. The Board, with assistance from the Investment Staff and its investment
consultant(s), shall determine an appropriate risk level for the LABF. Determining the risk tolerance level shall serve as
the first step in crafting an appropriate target asset allocation, setting investment goals and objectives, and making other
investment-related decisions. Understanding that risks evolve over time based on a number of factors including, but not
limited to, changes in the market environment and the LABF’s financial situation, the Investment Staff and investment
consultant(s) shall monitor risks and report any material changes in the LABF’s overall risk profile to the Board.

INVESTMENT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
The Board sets the goals and objectives of the investment portfolio solely in the interest of the LABF’s participants and
their beneficiaries. The performance objectives of the investment program are threefold:
1.

Meet or exceed the actuarial return assumption (see Appendix B: Assumed Investment Rate of Return and Policy
Benchmark), net-of-fees, over time with a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Board while maintaining
liquidity sufficient to cover benefit payments and other financial obligations.

2.

Outperform the policy benchmark (see Appendix B: Assumed Investment Rate of Return and Policy
Benchmark), net of fees, on a risk-adjusted basis over a market cycle (typically a three- to five-year period).

3.

Rank in at least the top half of the peer universe of comparable institutional investors with similar risk/return
parameters consistently over time.

PORTFOLIO EVALUATION AND REPORTING
The investment consultant(s) and Investment Staff will evaluate the investment portfolio on, at least, a quarterly basis.
The investment consultant(s) and Investment Staff will meet with the various investment managers and the Board on a
regular basis to review any changes to the investment guidelines and to analyze the investment performance and structure
of the investment program.
Investment Manager Performance Goals and Objectives:

5

 



Each investment manager is expected to outperform the agreed-upon benchmark, net-of-fees, on a riskadjusted basis over a market cycle (typically a three- to five-year period).
The total net-of-fees return for the mandate should rank above the median within the respective peer universe.
The investment manager shall attempt to achieve its return objectives while maintaining an appropriate level of
risk as specified in the investment manager’s guidelines.

The investment consultant(s) and or Investment Staff will promptly review with the Board any material shortfall in
performance relative to the performance objectives.
The investment managers shall also provide written reports to the Board, Investment Staff, and investment consultant(s)
on a quarterly basis. An investment manager’s quarterly reports shall typically include:












Portfolio and market commentary/outlook
Organizational updates (e.g. changes in personnel, management, ownership, etc.)
Market value of investments
List of all client-directed cash flows in and out of the account since inception (i.e. allocations to and redemptions
from the LABF’s account)
Gross and net-of-fees performance versus the benchmark for the most recent quarterly, year-to-date and relevant
longer-term periods
Calendar year returns (net of fees) versus the benchmark for all periods since inception
Attribution analysis
Investment fees for quarterly, year-to-date and inception-to-date periods
If applicable, brokerage activity data for quarterly and year-to-date periods
If applicable, capital account statement for quarterly, year-to-date and inception-to-date periods
Additional reasonable information as requested by the Board, Investment Staff, or investment consultant

INVESTMENT MANAGER WATCH LIST
When evaluating an investment manager, the Board utilizes a “watch list” process to identify managers that require closer
monitoring. Circumstances that may trigger the Board to place a manager on watch include:
 Poor performance of account relative to stated goals and objectives over a market cycle (typically a three- to fiveyear period)
 Material violations of the investment guidelines
 Failure to comply with the terms of the contract or agreement with the LABF
 Sale or merger of the investment management firm
 Changes in key personnel
 Material changes in investment philosophy, process, or style
 Legal or regulatory action taken against the investment management firm
 Unsatisfactory client service
 Noncompliance with the Board’s M/W/DBE Broker-Dealer Utilization Policy (See: Appendix E: M/W/DBE
Broker-Dealer Utilization Policy)
While on watch, investment managers may be required to meet with the Board and submit regular status reports. Removal
from the watch list usually results from either the manager resolving the issue(s) that led to it being placed on watch or the
Board deciding to terminate the account.
The Board will evaluate investment managers placed on watch for performance-related issues based on the manager’s riskadjusted performance versus their stated benchmark. Investment managers will also be evaluated versus the appropriate
peer universe and are expected to maintain net-of-fees performance above the peer median for three- and five-year time
periods.
Understanding that every situation is unique, the Investment Staff and investment consultant may recommend to the Board
additional criteria and a reasonable period over which to evaluate an investment manager while on the watch list.

6

 INVESTMENT GUIDELINES
The Board retains external investment managers to implement the target asset allocation. The investment guidelines
for a separate account are set at the time the Board retains the manager and are included in the contract or agreement
between the LABF and the investment manager. The Board and the investment manager may amend the guidelines in
writing. No deviation from the investment guidelines and objectives established in the contract or agreement between
the LABF and the investment manager shall occur unless agreed to in writing by the LABF. Each investment manager
must immediately inform the Board, Investment Staff, and the appropriate investment consultant in writing regarding
any deviation from the guidelines in the contract or agreement, as well as any material changes in investment strategy
or portfolio structure.

INVESTMENT MANAGER AND INVESTMENT CONSULTANT SEARCH PROCESS
With respect to an investment manager or investment consultant search, the Board will follow the procedures identified in
Appendix C: Procurement Policy for Investment Advisers and Consultants.
In accordance with Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/1-109.1), the Board has adopted a policy setting forth goals for
utilization of investment management firms that are businesses owned by minorities, women, and persons with
disabilities. The Board’s policy is included in Appendix D: M/W/DBE / Emerging Investment Manager Utilization
Policy.
In consideration of Section 1A-108.5 of the Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/1A-108.5) encouraging pension funds
to promote the economy of the State of Illinois through the use of economic opportunity investments, the LABF will
consider such investments to the greatest extent feasible within the bounds of financial and fiduciary prudence.

ASSET ALLOCATION
The Board shall maintain an appropriate asset allocation. The current target asset allocation is included in this Policy as
Appendix A: Target Asset Allocation. The Board, Investment Staff, and investment consultant(s) will review the asset
allocation at least annually and consider changes as deemed prudent.
Although it is the Board’s intention to maintain an allocation within the long-term allocation target ranges, the Board may
choose to allow the actual allocation to remain outside the target range if it believes market conditions warrant doing so.
The Board recognizes that certain allocations are illiquid in nature (e.g. private equity, real estate, etc.) and may remain
outside the target allocation range for extended periods of time.
In implementing the target asset allocation, the Board may utilize both active and passive management. Active
management is utilized in an attempt to exceed the performance of a certain index by a mutually agreed upon level,
net of fees. Passive management is utilized to mimic the performance of a specific index. Active management is
generally more expensive than passive management. Therefore, the Board utilizes active management when it believes
there is inefficiency in the market or there is a reasonable probability of achieving a net-of-fees return premium over
the associated index. Assets may be held in commingled funds or separate accounts.

LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND PORTFOLIO REBALANCING
The Board delegates to the Executive Director the authority to liquidate assets, as necessary, to cover benefit payments
and other financial obligations, including capital calls pertaining to certain closed-ended investment funds. Liquidity will
be primarily drawn from asset classes that exceed their respective allocation targets to help move the LABF’s overall asset
allocation closer to target allocations specified in Appendix A. The Executive Director will report such liquidity events to
the Board.
Additionally, due to fluctuations in asset values, the investment portfolio may need to be rebalanced occasionally by
shifting assets from one asset class or investment account to another in order to maintain asset allocations that are in line

7

 with the approved target ranges. In these instances, the investment consultant and Investment Staff will bring a rebalancing
plan to the Board for its approval. Upon approval by the Board, the Investment Staff will work to transition the assets.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Proxy Voting
The LABF delegates the responsibility of voting proxies to the investment manager who purchased the security on
its behalf. Each investment manager shall have full discretionary authority to vote the proxies. As fiduciaries,
investment managers shall exercise voting rights solely in the best interest of LABF, its participants and their
beneficiaries. In fulfilling its obligation, the manager will act in a manner deemed to be prudent and diligent, and
which is intended to enhance the economic value of the underlying security held.
On an annual basis (by January 31st of each year), each investment manager shall provide the Investment Staff with a
copy of the manager’s proxy voting policy and a written report detailing each proxy vote made during the prior
calendar year.

Securities Litigation (Class Actions) Policy
The LABF monitors pending and potential securities litigation cases and participates as appropriate to protect its
members’ interests.
Monitoring and reporting of potential litigation is carried out by the LABF’s outside securities litigation firms. The
firms may make recommendations to the LABF and to the LABF’s legal counsel(s) in situations where explicit legal
action may be taken by the LABF, such as petitioning for status as a lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit, bringing a
derivative action against a corporation, or participating in any form of collective litigation related to securities
purchased or sold outside of the United States. Depending on the merits of the recommendation, the matter will be
referred to the Board for consideration. Board approval is required before such action can be taken.
The LABF utilizes class action claim filing services offered by the master custodian. The master custodian will pursue
the LABF’s interest through the claim process and will complete the appropriate forms and provide the proper
supporting documents to protect the LABF’s claims. The LABF’s master custodian will provide periodic reporting
related to the pending and settled class action litigation in which the LABF has an interest.

BOARD AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS
From time-to-time, the Board may establish certain investment restrictions at the overall LABF level that shall be
instituted in addition to mandate-specific restrictions found in individual investment manager contracts. Subject to an
investment manager’s exercise of fiduciary duties, the investment manager shall comply with such restrictions. See
Appendix F: Restrictions on Investment for a current list of such restrictions.

AMENDMENTS TO THE INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT
The Board may amend this Investment Policy Statement at any time. If changes are made to the Investment Policy
Statement, the Board shall file a copy of the new policy with the Illinois Department of Insurance within 30 days as
specified in the Illinois Pension Code. [40 ILCS 5/1-113.6]

portfolio of at least $10,000,000 but less than $10,000,000,000 and is a "minority-owned business", "women-owned business" or
"business owned by a person with a disability" as those terms are defined in the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and

APPENDIX E. M/W/DBE BROKER-DEALER UTILIZATION POLICY
The Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago (‘LABF”) is committed to
providing opportunities for minority owned business entities, women owned business entities, and business entities
owned by a person with a disability as defined in the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with
Disabilities Act (30 ILCS 575/2).
Pursuant to the Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/1-109.1(7)), LABF Board of Trustees (the “Board”) adopted the
following M/W/DBE broker-dealer utilization policy. Where specific minority broker-dealer utilization goals are not
set or do not apply, the Board encourages the investment managers to make a best-efforts attempt to utilize minority
broker-dealers.
Investment managers of separately managed accounts, subject to best execution and their fiduciary duty to LABF in
the management of LABF assets, shall make a best effort to adhere to the following minimum M/W/DBE brokerdealer utilization goals:
Asset Class

As a Percentage of Total Commissions

20%
10%
10%
As a Percentage of Total Par Value Traded
25%

Fixed Income

Investment managers shall not utilize indirect methods, such as “step-out” commissions, to achieve these goals.
Therefore, to meet LABF’s M/W/DBE goals, all trades must be executed directly with the M/W/DBE broker-dealers.
In consideration of Section 1A-108.5 of the Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/1A-108.5), the Board encourages the
utilization of qualified broker-dealers that have an office in Chicago or within the State of Illinois.
Each investment manager shall submit a compliance report to LABF on a quarterly basis in a format as reasonably
requested by LABF. LABF investment staff will report to the Board annually on the utilization of M/W/DBE brokerdealers. If an investment manager fails to comply with the above guidelines on a calendar basis, they may be asked
to appear before the Board and explain why they were unable to achieve the M/W/DBE utilization goals. Failure by
an investment manager to meet the M/W/DBE brokerage goals will be considered a factor when evaluating overall
performance of the investment manager.
This policy will be reviewed annually.

APPENDIX F. RESTRICTIONS ON INVESTMENT
The restrictions set forth below apply to separate accounts holding publicly traded equity and fixed-income securities.
With respect to all other investments, the Board strongly encourages adherence to these restrictions.
Unless the LABF provides its investment managers with a list of specifically restricted investments, it shall be the
responsibility of the investment manager to determine a reasonable basis by which to identify such restricted
investments and make a reasonable effort to adhere to such restrictions.
List of current restrictions:
Assault Weapon Manufacturer
Adopted February 18, 2014

Subject to an investment manager’s exercise of fiduciary duties, investment managers should refrain from
purchasing or holding securities of an assault weapon manufacturer if the manager determines that the same
investment goals concerning risk, return, and diversification can be achieved through the purchase or holding of
another security.
For the purposes of this policy, “assault weapon manufacturer” shall mean any entity that manufactures prohibited
assault weapons for civilian use. “Prohibited assault weapon” shall have the same meaning as the term “assault
weapon” in the Municipal Code of Chicago.
These Assault Weapon Manufacturer restrictions shall expire, by their terms, on May 31, 2020, unless extended by
further Board action.

I am writing on behalf of the Board of Trustees of the Laborers? and Retirement Board Employees?
Annuity and Bene?t Fund of Chicago (the to request that the City of Chicago remit to the LABF the
amount representing the historical shortfalls in employer contributions due to losses associated with property tax
collections. As you are aware, the LABF is required each year to ?certify to the city council the annual amounts
required under this Article [Article 11 of the Illinois Pension Code, 40 ILCS 5/1 1-101 et seq], for which the tax
herein provided shall be levied for the following year? [40 ILCS However, since a portion of the
property taxes that are levied are ultimately never collected and the City failed to levy an amount that takes into
consideration these losses, the LABF has not received the full amount that was certi?ed. The LABF therefore has
absorbed a shortfall in City contributions based on the shortfall associated with the collection of property taxes
levied by the City for many years. The LABF believes it is not obligated to absorb this shortfall.

Based on a recent accounting of estimated losses for tax levy years 2008 through 2017, LABF has
absorbed aggregate losses of approximately $3 million. This data serves only to illustrate the magnitude of the
more recent losses and is not intended to limit the City of Chicago?s obligations to this specific period. For levy
year 2007, the City used sources other than the property tax to finance its contribution to the LABF and the LABF
therefore suffered no loss associated with that specific year. For tax levy years 2000 through 2006 (payment
years 2001 through 2007), the LABF received no employer contributions whatsoever. During this period, the
City erroneously relied on language found in Section 11-178 which specifies that if certain conditions are met,
?the city shall cease to contribute the sum stated in this Section [emphasis added]? as the basis for not making any
contributions. However, Section 1 1-178 is used to determine only one component part of the City?s total required
contribution. If certain conditions are met, the City shall cease making just the contributions specified in 11?178,
but not all other required contributions. Despite not receiving any contributions, the LABF continued to certify
its annual ?nancing requirement to the City. The amount the LABF certi?ed for this seven-year period totaled
approximately $125 million. Additionally, the LABF suffered losses associated with the tax levy collection for
levy years 1970 through 1999.

There are four primary reasons why the LABF believes it should not suffer losses associated with the property
tax collections. They are as follows:

1. Precedent Exists for Levying an Amount in Anticipation of a Loss. At various points between 1945 and
1969, the Fund requested a tax levy amount (not exceeding the maximum authorized tax levy amount per
the Statutes) that anticipated a tax levy loss ranging from 7.5% to 10% depending on the year. This
amount was then levied and budgeted for by the City, demonstrating that the City has long been aware of
and at times anticipated a shortfall in property tax collections.

2. The Plain Language of the Law Accounts for Losses Associated with Property Tax Collections. Public
Act 76?1509 was enacted on September 22, 1969 and changed the tax levy cap calculation methodology,
moving it from a ?at percentage of taxable property to a multiple of the amount employees contributed
two years prior. Prior to 1970, a limit existed with respect to the amount of property tax that could be
levied. The law read that the tax ?shall be not more than? a speci?ed amount. [40 ILCS 
The 1969 Act explicitly changed the methodology going forward. After PA 76?1509, the law clearly read
that beginning in 1970, ?the city shall levy a tax annually at a rate. . .that will produce, when extended, not
to exceed an amount equal to the total amount of contributions by the employees to the fund made in the
calendar year 2 years prior to the year for which the annual applicable tax is levied, multiplied by
[applicable 1nu1tiplier]?. In other words, the limit, starting in 1970, was not on the amount of the tax levy;
rather, the limit was on the amount produced by the tax levy. However, the fact is that the contributions
to the LABF that are derived from the tax levy have been less than the levied amount due to losses and
the cost of collections, which have been absorbed by the LABF up to the present.

3. The Original Drafters Accounted for Challenges Associated with Property Tax Collections. Since June
21, 1935, the date that House Bill 968 was enacted creating the LABF, at least two sources have existed
that have been available to ?nance the City?s employer contributions to the LABF. The ?rst is obviously
the property tax levy. However, presumably anticipating delays or shortfalls in property tax collections,
the original law also stated that the funds available for the purposes of this Act shall be insuf?cient
during any year to meet the requirements of this Act, such city [the City of Chicago] may issue tax
anticipation warrants, as provided by law, against the tax levy herein provided for, for the current year?.
This clearly demonstrates that the general intent was to prevent the LABF from suffering ?nancially
because of funding delays or shortfalls associated with property tax collections.

4. The City is No Longer Limited to Utilizing Property Tax Proceeds. On June 27, 1997, Public Act 90?
0031 was enacted allowing the City ?to use other lawfully available funds in lieu of all or part of the levy?
in order to ?nance contributions to the LABF. If for no other reason, the ability to utilize other sources
should have ended the practice of forcing the LABF to absorb the loss associated with the property tax
collection. The City, however, has not used other funds in lieu of the levy to address the shortfall.

Based on the forgoing, I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how the City of Chicago
will address these shortfalls in contributions to the LABF. I would also be happy to further explain or share
evidence with you substantiating the points made above. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience
