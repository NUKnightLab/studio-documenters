III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, April 19, 2013
Director Michael, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved to accept the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of April 19, 2013. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
With regard to request number 1, John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, provided additional
information. He stated that foreign claims are based on services provided by Federally-Qualified Health
Centers (FQHCs) and other health care facilities to the CountyCare patients. The expense relating to these
claims was budgeted for in the 260 account, and was based on the number of members/months; this request to
increase and amend the contract is due to the fact that this was simply not included in the AHS contract when it

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
was initially negotiated and structured. Director Michael inquired whether this appropriation is to cover actual
claims, so that the System will only pay as much as the services are provided. Mr. Cookinham responded
affirmatively; he stated that the proposed increase is an estimate – if the System does not incur that level of
claims, then the System does not have to pay that money.
It was noted that a correction was needed on the transmittal. According to Ms. Besenhofer, the correct total
contract value, which includes this proposed increase, should be $34,130,286.00.
Mr. Oder inquired regarding the basis for the processing fee. Mr. Cookingham responded that, for the
administrative services the vendor provides, the initial contract was based on a per member/per month basis.
Mr. Oder inquired whether the County reviews any of these claims, or whether they just pay the vendor. Mr.
Cookinham responded that AHS does some review, and the System does a review as well before it submits the
list of claims for funding.
Board Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding the commercially useful purpose or function that the
subcontractor under the contract, Sigma Advanced Solutions, Inc., is providing. Susan Greene, Interim
Director of Managed Care, stated that the individual from Sigma maps all of their processes for all of the
services they provide. He keeps track of the data flow, and does all of the data reporting that is requested by
the System.
Director Michael, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 5. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV
IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports – April 2013 (Attachment #2)
Mr. Cookinham presented the Financial Reports for the period through April 2013. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the information.
With regard to the information regarding Accounts Receivable and days of revenue outstanding, Mr.
Cookinham indicated that this number has been recently reduced to ninety-seven; the goal is one hundred days
or less. Board Chairman Carvalho noted that there is a built-in inherent delay of ninety days, as the System is
required to send three notices thirty days apart to the patient to try to collect. Mr. Cookinham stated that last
year, it was initially calculated that the structural limit was no less than one hundred days; he stated that he
may go back and recalculate that number. He added that the CountyCare Program is going to cause the days to
go up a little bit, because as the application is taken for CountyCare, the self-pay statement is suspended in the
collection cycle while the application is being processed; he believes that if the System can remain around one
hundred days or so of revenue outstanding, that will be good.
During the Committee’s review of the information on the payer mix, a discussion was held regarding the
System’s activities relating to patient experience and enrollment of patients in CountyCare; additionally, the
activities needed to retain these patients in the System was discussed. Director Michael indicated that, at the
recent Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, results of a recent patient satisfaction survey of the
patients of the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN) were reviewed and
discussed; the survey results were not encouraging. Board Chairman Carvalho requested that this information

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports – April 2013 (continued)
be reviewed by Dr. Krishna Das, System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation, at
the May 31st Board Meeting1, in order for the full Board to have a discussion on the subject. He noted that the
data itself is not expected to be discussed; rather, the Board should discuss what is expected to be done in
response to the survey results.
During Mr. Cookinham’s review of the financial reports, it was indicated that the average daily census at
Provident Hospital of Cook County is thirteen. Chairman O’Donnell requested that clarification and further
information be provided. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of Clinical Integration, stated that the number thirteen
refers to those patients who are only ones who meet criteria to be admitted to the hospital. He reminded the
Committee that characteristically, there are approximately seven to ten patients who are in an observation
status, because according to Medicare or Medicaid guidelines, they do not meet full criteria for admission.
Those patients in observation status are receiving stabilization, therapy or diagnostic testing and are discharged
to home, but the System cannot charge for an inpatient day.
During the Committee’s discussion of the information regarding the case mix index and payer mix, Dr.
Shannon noted that a number of the patients that are commercial payers are brought to the System for specialty
care (example: Burn or Trauma services); those patients tend to have a set of skewed diagnoses or conditions
that bring them in. With regard to the information on the case mix index, Dr. Shannon stated that usually an
organization will see an improvement in this when investments are made in concurrent coding; concurrent
coding is essentially coding coachers who can help the medical staff by pointing out complications of chronic
conditions and indicating what is better documentation of those chronic conditions, so that the case mix index
rises. As the case mix rises, it much more accurately reflects the complexity of the patients being served,
which affects reimbursement in many situations. Also, but not unimportantly, that case mix index has a
correcting effect on quality and safety data for the organization, because if it looks like the System’s patients
are not terribly sick, and one looks at the outcomes they have, that is very different than if staff has accurately
described the severity of illness and complexity and co-morbidities of the System’s patients; if there is a
complication it is against a different background of complexity. It usually requires a heavy investment in
concurrent coding staff that are literally in the electronic record, asking the medical staff for a clarification each
day on an ongoing basis; Dr. Shannon noted that, in many cases, that kind of investment pays for itself.
Chairman O’Donnell inquired whether the System is making that investment. Mr. Cookinham responded that
staff is looking at the software that would assist in that process; staff is also looking at acquiring the people for
this purpose in the 2014 budget. Chairman O’Donnell stated that the Committee strongly recommends that the
System make this investment.

B. Update on the following projects:
i. Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare
Ms. Greene provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare.
She stated that to date, 56,000 applications have been initiated. As a reminder, she stated that
approximately 500 applications are initiated per day; it takes about 25 days to submit to the Illinois
Department of Human Services (DHS), on average. In total, the System has submitted over 30,000
applications to DHS. Last month, DHS processed 5,000 applications, although the System submitted 9,000
applications to them for processing. There is concern about the lag in processing; as previously mentioned,
the State has agreed to increase the staffing level to 100 staff members.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on the following projects:
i. Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare (continued)
In terms of processing approvals and denials, the administration hopes that the State’s ability to process the
same amount per day that are submitted by the System will occur around August; this should provide for a
more accurate reflection in the revenue of reality. She noted that, in last month’s approvals, for 54% of the
approvals, the System was paid for 3 months of retroactive per member per month (PMPM) fees, plus for
the current month. For 46% of last month’s approvals, the System was paid for 2 months of retroactive per
member per month (PMPM) fees, plus for the current month.
Ms. Greene stated that one of the services that CountyCare members demand from the System and really
want to come to the County for, even though they have other alternatives, is some specialty care. There is a
real belief in the community that if they come to the System they will be accurately diagnosed and will
receive really good care. That is an area of focus upon which the System should really try to improve. She
indicated that there is a tremendous backlog of requests through the IRIS referral system to get
appointments; Managed Care staff recently worked to take the CountyCare requests out of there, and over
the course of two days called and actually scheduled appointments, instead of sliding people into
appointments and robo-calling them to inform them of their appointment. She stated that she wants to track
this data to see if the no-show rate is reduced as a result of a person actually calling and taking the patient’s
schedule into account.
Ms. Greene stated that the administration is in the process of hiring staff for the Managed Care Department.
Her replacement is being interviewed by leadership; the permanent team should be in place by the end of
June or early July.
Ms. Greene stated that interesting facts are starting to emerge about the CountyCare members. She stated
that 27% of the approved members are completely new to the System and the FQHCs. These are members
whose applications are not coming from the FQHCs - they are either coming through the call center or in
one of the System’s facilities; these patients have no prior experience when staff tries to match them in the
Cerner System, so this shows that the System is continuing to attract new people. Chairman O’Donnell
inquired whether the System can track the data on those patients, to see if they remain in the System and
receive services. Ms. Greene responded affirmatively. Director Michael inquired whether any
demographics are known of this group. He asked whether their health status is comparable to the existing
System patients. Ms. Greene responded that very little is known about them, because the System only has
historical claims data on people who are in the System; these patients are new to the System.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that, in the Finance Committee Meeting Minutes, there was a discussion
about having a future discussion with the full Board about what policy adjustments might be needed to be
made to the CareLink Policy, based on when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rolls out and regarding people
who are eligible but do not sign up – what happens when those people present at System facilities for nonemergency care? Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, stated that the administration is really re-doing
the entire CareLink Policy, because of the changes to the State government rules and the roll-out of the
ACA. Board Chairman Carvalho requested that this be placed on the Agenda for the Board Meeting in
June2. Dr. Raju responded affirmatively.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on the following projects (continued):
ii. Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) contract management/electronic exchange system
Ms. Besenhofer provided a brief update on the implementation of the GHX system. She stated that some
areas are working well as a result of the implementation, while others are still adapting to the new
processes; this represents a total change in culture. Most of the feedback from the departments has been
extremely positive; they have never had this type of visibility, and they are beginning to understand the
value and benefits of not having to order a year’s worth of product at a time, and getting their product
delivered on time. It has been an interesting mix of feedback, but overall it has been fairly positive. Getting
people accustomed to using the online requisitioning has been interesting, and Supply Chain continues to
work with that. Training sessions continue with the Supply Chain staff, as knowledge transfer has not gone
as well as was hoped. Staff augmentation is planned to be gone by the end of June; she noted that she is a
little bit concerned, as she still has open positions that are critical to continue to help keep the System
running like it needs to be run.
Staff is still working through the acceptable procedures and documentation for payment of invoices. The
lack of integration with the JD Edwards System and Lawson System has meant that staff is doing double
work. This is not something that was necessarily foreseen, so staff is trying to keep up with it the best they
can. Work flow changes and possible options to streamline that workflow and paperwork process are being
identified, but it is still a labor-intensive, paper process. With regard to the activities relating to the
County’s ERP system, Ms. Besenhofer stated that right now the County’s plan is to go out with a Countywide RFP in January 2014 for an ERP system. They are planning to award the contract in June 2014, and
they have a two to three year implementation cycle; in the meantime, the administration is going to need to
come up with an interim process and some sort of electronic integration, because on both on the Finance
side and the Supply Chain side, the double work is not sustainable for much longer.
With regard to the Phase II plan for the GHX implementation, the go-live date is set for June 3rd; Phase II is
related specifically to the Operating Room Sterile Processing and Cath Lab. A daily interface will be run
with the Lawson Item Master into the Cerner SurgiNet System; Ms. Besenhofer noted that she has been
working very closely with Tanda Russell, Interim Executive Director of Nursing, and her team, as well as
Dr. Bala Hota, Chief Information Officer, and his team; the hope is that the information will be given
appropriately to the Surgery folks so that they will be able to code appropriately, and the System will be
able to pick up charges. There was a little bit of a hiccup earlier this week, from a database perspective. It
is believed that the go-live will take place as planned; however, if there is a delay, it will only be delayed for
approximately one week.

iii. Meaningful Use
Dr. Hota provided an update on Meaningful Use. He stated that, as of today, the System has received over
$15 million in total subsidies for its Meaningful Use attestation process. The System has attested for
Provident and Stroger Hospitals for Medicaid for two years and for Medicare for last year. Additionally,
the System went through a cycle of attesting for Meaningful Use for the eligible providers; that amounts to
approximately a $2 million subsidy for this year. The System is looking to increase the number of providers
that the System can attest for, moving forward. He stated that the System is very dependent on the
Medicaid payer mix, because the criteria at the provider level is that at least 30% of the provider’s patients
are covered by Medicaid. As more members are enrolled into CountyCare and providers begin to provide
services to them, this should hopefully increase the Medicaid payer mix for the providers.

Report from System Director of Supply Chain Management
A. Report of emergency purchases
There were no emergency purchases to report at this time.

VI. Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
Mr. Cookinham reviewed his report on Patient Utilization Trends. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.
Board Chairman Carvalho indicated that the State has often talked about moving to managed care for many years,
but has never successfully done so; this time, they are actually going to do it. In the past, every single time they
have talked about doing it, the County has had built-in some sort of protection for its Health System. He inquired
whether there any protections built into this program, and if not, he inquired as to the System’s strategy in dealing
with the fact that 50% of the State’s Medicaid population is going to be in managed care.
Dr. Raju stated that the amendment that the State is putting together, that passed in committee but is still on the
General Assembly floor, is an opportunity for a lot of folks to enter the managed care market as a provider (known
as a Managed Care Community Network, or MCCN, and now known as Accountable Care Entities, or ACEs).
There are very high standards - if their organization in Cook County wants to enter as an ACE, they must have a
minimum of 40,000 enrollees in their program. That creates a barrier for some organizations to enter into the ACE
market. Secondly, because of the nature of the number of enrollees in CountyCare, Dr. Raju expects that the
System will be entering into the market very easily because the sheer number of enrollees are there. As to the
question regarding figuring out the auto assignment for those in managed care who do not select their medical
home and are automatically assigned a default location – would the System be the default plan or not? He
indicated that the answer should be yes. He agreed that there is a need to have a good managed care strategy going
forward, because that is what is going to keep the System sustainable.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that there is another issue relating to this subject – for those individuals who are
assigned to a managed care entity other than the System who decide to come to the System anyway for nonemergency situations (for example, to get a second opinion, or because pharmaceuticals are free, or because they
are used to coming to the System’s facility), there needs to be a strategy for dealing with those individuals. Just as
the System needs to confront those individuals who are eligible for ACA but who do not enroll, the System will
need to have a strategy of, frankly, screening out people for non-emergency situations if they are enrolled in
another plan and they are coming to the System.

VII. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman O’Donnell declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended April 30, 2013. This discussion focuses on
the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month. It
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
5
Page 25 of 70

 eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the five months with overall
revenue of $290,792 and overall expenses was $399,712.
Net Patient revenue for the five months was $159,985.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
EHR incentive program revenue was $6,394.
Other revenue was $1,893. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
April-2013 reduced by 22 to 100 days. Additionally, there was a 1 day increase in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including 1115 waiver
and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

6
Page 26 of 70

 Total billed accounts grew by $8.785M (3.0%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure increased by $9.943M (3.4%),
but has declined in eleven (11) out of the last fifteen (15) months. The overall decline in
this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the collection
process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of April-2013 increased by
$2.837M (32.1%), as compared the November 30, 2012 balance and increased by
$2.603M (28.7%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that
fewer inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of April-2013 increased by $20.593M (13.2%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure also grew by $9.953M (6.0%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates less accounts had the collection process completed
than in the previous month and that fewer accounts are being removed from active
accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad debt
write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.

 Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $3.744M (21.6%) by the end of
April-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2012. This
balance, as of the end of this month, was $1.885M (9.8%) larger than the previous
month’s balance. This indicates that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed”
status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of April-2013 fell by $11.809M
(8.5%) over the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is $0.009M (0.0%) less
than last month’s figure.
The decline in this figure indicates that more Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Page 28 of 70

 Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $68.870M
Insurance - $4.929M.
Depreciation - $14.146M
Utilities - $3.228M

Nonoperating Revenue was $122.411M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
sales tax in the amount of $27.986M and property tax in the amount of $33.344M. Sales
tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the underlying
sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois - Sales Tax
represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet received from the
state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales transaction to the
receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

Note: The above accounts (i.e., Inventory, Supplies Expense, etc.) affected by the implementation and installation of the Lawson Inventory/Accounts Payable module,
by the Supply Chain Management group, do not have correct year-to-date balances starting the month of January 2013; related transactions are still in contention
and in the process of getting management approval for posting onto the Lawson general ledger system.

Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" totals are payments to the state for supplemental workers
hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Meaningful Use budget is spread over 12 months, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received. Meaningful Use includes
both the Medicare and Medicaid portions.

 Patient Utilization Trends
Patient Utilization Trends
• A comparison of Fiscal 2012 gross charges by payer to an 
estimate of 2013 gross charges provides some additional 
insight into economic problems of CCHHS.
• The comparison shows that the System will provide over 10 
million dollars of care to patients that come from Cermak.
• The comparison also shows that both managed Medicare 
and Managed Medicaid are growing as a portion of the 
over‐all system activity.  These two payer sources do not 
pay as well as the traditional programs.
• CountyCare
y
through April of 2013 now accounts for 3.6% of 
g p
total charge volume.  In 2012 there were not any 
CountyCare patients.  The portion of revenue from 
CountyCare is expected to continue to grow in 2013.
