In response to Ms. Butts’ inquiry, Jeremiah Swetel,
Chief Operations Officer, stated that these are
additional cameras requested for five branches. The
Library has exterior cameras at some locations that
exceed ten different exterior views.
In response to Mr. Corrigan’s inquiry, Joyce Dodrill,
Chief Legal Officer, stated that if there is a request
to view camera footage regardless of where it comes
from, Safety & Protective Services always forwards the
request to the Legal Department to determine if the
request is about Library patrons, in which case it
requires a subpoena.
Mr. Corrigan stated that it would be good for the
Library to memorialize this process from the Board level
as requests come in, the issue of who has cameras and
what they are doing with them will probably become a
larger issue as we go.

In response to Mr. Hairston’s inquiry, Director Thomas
stated that we could continue to examine the correlation
between employees’ participation, health scores and work
attendance.
Carrie Krenicky, Chief Financial Officer, stated that we
annually submit a report to the Board on employee
screening and points received after their screening. We
are currently screening and data will be collected in
January. Another report will follow.
Mr. Hairston stated that he is interested in the
correlation between employee participation and sick
leave.
Director Thomas stated that a correlation has not been
made to determine if employee participation has caused a
decrease in sick leave.
Ms. Krenicky stated that numbers in productivity have
consistently been around 85%.
Mr. Corrigan stated that we have fewer than 600
employees, it will only take a few employees with severe
health issues to skew the numbers dramatically. In
effect, the averages are affected by catastrophic
illness rather than the overall health of the staff.
Therefore, the numbers may not be helpful without
qualification of that aspect of it.
Director Thomas stated that this may be brought to the
Human Resources Committee as the biometrics used have
been a concern to the union. We need to determine if
this has value one way or the other.

one public employer to another; and accrual rates. With
these revisions all the separate elements that relate to

University Circle Inc.; and
WHEREAS, The Executive Director desires to designate
certain Library employees to serve in his place on the
boards and committees of certain nonprofit organizations

 1132

listed in Exhibit “A”; and
WHEREAS, This Board of Trustees desires to adopts this
Resolution in compliance with the aforementioned
opinions of the Ohio Ethics Commission and Ohio Attorney
General; now therefore be it
RESOLVED, That the Board of Trustees of the Cleveland
Public retroactively approves and formally designates
that the Executive Director, CEO and his designees, as
long as they serve on the boards and committees of those
organizations listed in Exhibit “A” or other nonprofit
organizations in the future, provide those services in
their official capacities as representatives of the
Cleveland Public Library, and further instructs the
Executive Director, CEO and his designees to represent
the interests of the Cleveland Public Library while so
serving.
Mr. Hairston said this resolution indicates that
Director Thomas is heavily woven into the fabric of the
community and asked if the Director would be permitted
to serve on for-profit boards.
Bryan Szalewski, Senior Legal Officer, stated that the
Attorney General opinion applies to nonprofit
corporations specifically because the Library and
certain nonprofit corporations may have related
interests. To the extent that a private for-profit
corporation may have business interests with the
Library, Ohio Ethics Laws would generally preclude the
Director from serving on the board of a for profit
corporation with which the Library does business.

Mr. Seifullah seconded the motion, which passed
unanimously by roll call vote.

as well as the digital versions of the 1968 and 1969
volumes available through Internet Archive and found
the others in an online search using the original
1976 edition in CLGH. The professor also requested a
search of Aristotle’s Poetics for the section that
talked about writing “probable” vs. “possible”
stories. Mr. Boozer utilized the Perseus Digital

Learning Commons/Programs
Cleveland Digital Public Library regularly hosted
classes over the summer. In partnership with DanceUSA,
we hosted a workshop on digitizing and archiving dance
company records. Working with Youth Services, we held
three separate classes teaching papermaking to patrons
and had 21 attendees over the summer. Working with
Special Collections to show off library materials that
reflected the class activity, we held a calligraphy
class with 6 attendees, and a font making class with 5.
Working with CPL FIT, ClevDPL regularly hosted Yoga and
Core Strengthening. Weekly Yoga and Core Strengthening
offerings are regularly attended by over 30 attendees a
week, 90 over a month, and 270 over the summer. About
half of attendees are from downtown offices and half
from library participants in our FIT program. Finally,
we’ve held 12 meetings of the CPL Chess Club with a
total headcount of 27 attendees over the summer.
Exhibits
In terms of media, object registration, and exhibit
preparation ClevDPL continues to support both the John
G. White exhibit and the Library History exhibit that
were planned for sesquicentennial. Before the summer,
staff in ClevDPL collaborated with staff from Graphics,
Archives, and Special Collections to design and install
the “CPL: 150 Years through the Eyes of the Staff” and
the “John G. White” exhibits. During the summer, ClevDPL
continued to help with ongoing tasks and projects
related to Sesquicentennial shows. Support includes
including maintaining the media displays in Brett Hall
and programming and adding content to the Magic Box in
the John G. White Gallery. Also during summer 2019,
ClevDPL staff worked with OPS, revisiting the current
status of the “facilities brief” as a useful document
and collecting and sharing data from temperature and
humidity monitors in the Brett Hall exhibit space.

Magic Box
After a shift in priorities by the puppet curators,
Cleveland Digital Public Library moved the Magic Box
exhibit case to the John G. White Gallery on the third
floor of Main. We refreshed the interactive content for
the John G. White exhibit over the summer.
Touch Wall
The interactive touch wall in the third floor space in
Cleveland Digital Public Library continues to be used by
casual visitors and classes. It had content updates in
over the summer, and we have continued to refine content
to enhance accessibility and use.
Videography and Photography
Before the summer, ClevDPL has finished loading all of
the videos from Sports Research Center, Cleveland
Restoration Society, the Andrew Venable Oral History
Project, Cleveland Growing Strong, and Library
Institutional Oral History interviews onto Internet
Archive and YouTube and, working with CPL’s Internet
Team, has also embedded them in ContentDM records in the
Digital Gallery. During the summer, we leveraged the
automated closed captioning in YouTube to create
searchable transcripts for all of the above oral history
recordings
Working with Langston Hughes Manager William Bradford
and Professor Anne Galletta from CSU, CPL has been
developing exemplary oral history interviews of subjects
who remember the 1964 Freedom Day protests here in
Cleveland. The goal is to produce four sample interviews
and work with professor Galletta to assist her to seek
funding for a larger project. ClevDPL continues to work
with the Cleveland Architecture foundation to support
oral history interviews of prominent Cleveland
architects.

Outreach
ClevDPL continues a collaboration with Dr. Regennia
Williams on an interview project related to the antiapartheid activism in Cleveland during the 1980s. We
have been working with her to produce a sample set of
interviews so that she can pursue funding opportunities.
ClevDPL continues to work with the Cleveland Orchestra
to scan scrapbooks.
Cleveland Digital Public Library continues to work with
local newspapers to provide access to the back files of
member news organizations. We already provide access to
Tremonster, Plain Press, and East Side Daily News. We
have completed work with our vendor to get 1970-2000 of
Cleveland Scene digitized.
Working with the Internet Archive, CDPL is closing out
the grant for curating web-content (part of a 35,000
dollar IMLS grant working with the Internet Archive’s
ArchiveIT project to document local web-content and
local digital resources). ClevDPL has created a
collection in the Digital Gallery (ContentDM) for Web
Archives and has populated the collection. We have done
numerous public presentations on our Web Archiving, and
have presentations planned for the summer. We will be
doing a final training on web archiving this fall.
ClevDPL staff has continued to enhance demonstration
digitization projects with Euclid Library, the Ukrainian
Museum and Archives, Shaker Heights Public Library,
Cleveland Orchestra and the South Brooklyn Historical
Society.
We have arranged with the administrator of the
Literature Collection regarding storing the surveyed,
refoldered, reboxed, and relabeled W. Ward Marsh
collection and will be moving the collection to
Literature in early fall.
We have initiated a project with literature to obtain
physical copies of programs, update and scan programs,

 1177

and capture natively digital programs of theatre
productions from Playhouse Square.
Collection Development
Scene Magazine Digitized. Scene magazine has been rescanned after a quality control glitch, and is currently
in post-production, correction, and revision. This
constitutes well over 40,000 pages of news and has been
converted to METS-ALTO. Upload of the newspaper will
proceed this fall.
Library Staff Does Digitization
ClevDPL team is currently addressing how to better
mediate and manage the large number of scanning
projects that are moving through the unit at this
time. Scan: 235 items, 7,434 files created. Post: 127
items, 6,849 post processed. Upload: 501 items, 716
files.

Preservation
Managing Art Collections
CPL has one of the largest and most significant Art
Collections in any public library in the country.
ClevDPL is currently updating the database listing of
items in the collection, and is currently exploring
collaboration with financial services to add all of
CPL’s art holdings to the real property inventory
maintained in our MUNIS system so CPL’s art will be
audited on a regular schedule.
During the summer, most of the Superman items sent to
Intermuseum Conservation Association were returned to
the library. One item remains to be completed.
Due to renovations at Fleet we have an untitled Clarence
Van Duzer sculpture at Main Library in the

 1178

preservation/conservation lab area. Here is a link to a
picture:
https://cdm16014.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p
4014coll13/id/1974/rec/1 . We anticipate shipping the
sculpture to ICA in September. Staff will need
assistance and training to pack and ship the item, but
should be able to do it effectively with proper
instruction.
Currently, due to renovations at Collinwood, we have the
center panel of Max Bachofen’s Snow and Wind (triptych),
oil on canvas (Left: H 46" x W 36 1/8"; Center: H 46"
x W 59 3/16" ; Right: H 46" x 34 1/8") in storage on a
cart in the basement microfilm area of Main Library. It
came here as result of reductions in wall space out at
the branch. At the moment we are at the very beginning
of developing a plan for how to effectively move and
manage art in the library for the next several years,
and this plan should look to existing expertise in the
library that can effectively manage the process and plan
for developing appropriate skills in staff.
With the goal of developing staff in mind, during August
and into September, ClevDPL contacted the Intermuseum
Conservation Association and received a positive
response to working with ICA to develop workshop
trainings for art moving and packing for staff working
on CPL’s Preservation/Conservation teams. In addition,
ClevDPL has just begun discussing with Property
Management the possibility of developing collaboration
with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame staff to do a workshop
on how to build crates for pictures and sculptures for
CPL carpenters. An additional hope for these workshops
is to involve the student art curation program that
enabled CMSD students to put together the WPA print
exhibit our ML King Branch.
Environmental Monitoring
Working with Property Management, including Oliver
Reyes, ClevDPL continues to monitor from 22 placements
around Main and LSW using PEM II environmental
monitoring devices.
We have upgraded our monitoring subscription with the
Image Permanence Institute.

 1179

As a new development in summer, OPS requested that we
monitor the environment in Brett Hall, and we added
monitoring in 3 cases using Arten monitors, and placed a
PEM II in Brett hall to log temperature and humidity.
Monitoring in Brett Hall should be a year-round
activity.
Stacks and Collections
ClevDPL has completed its work on studying potential
stack options for storing over-sized maps from the maps
collection. We have received appropriate conservation
housings, and have moved forward with wrapping maps on
storage tubes. We have obtained appropriate storage
racks for the rolled maps, but we still have the rolled
maps stored in our 5th floor storage area in Main
Building, there is now foam padding on the storage rack
arms. Moving of maps should happen this fall.
IPM monitoring
ClevDPL has placed insect traps appropriate for
establishing the detection portion of an integrated
pest management (IPM) program in Main, LSW, and
Lakeshore Facility. We are currently monitoring LSW,
Main, and Lakeshore.
Facility Brief
ClevDPL wrote the library’s ‘facility brief’, a
document produced for the Superman exhibit. This
document uses elements of an American Museum
Association facility report. The data previously
collected for the brief is now out of date. Depending
on planned uses for spaces in the library, a document
like the ‘facilities brief’ may sometimes serve as a
de-facto facilities report, and in many cases we may
not need to produce a full facilities report per AMA.
The document needs to be revised, and the process of
gathering data for display areas at the library needs
to reboot.
Exhibits Monitoring and Install
ClevDPL has restarted using PEM II and Arten devices to
monitor temperature and humidity levels in Brett Hall.
ClevDPL continues to use them in the John G. White
Gallery where materials that might need to be monitored
have been installed. These readings are being recorded
and maintained for future reference.

 1180

Metadata Revision
There were 69,377 record touches on metadata in the
digital gallery. This work mostly consisted of additions
to records to link high resolution images in long-term
storage with low resolution access copies presented
through the digital gallery.
ClevDPL continues to engage with DPLA. We continue to
contribute to WorldCat through OCLC’s Digital Collection
Gateway. We are engaging CPL’s cataloging team to
explore how to pull records developed from our ContentDM
collections now in WorldCat into our Sirsi catalog.
ClevDPL has accepted a role on a ContentDM/linked data
project that has emerged from the Metadata Initiatives
Advisory Group. The project will explore possible new,
and more effective routes for delivering metadata,
images, and information using linked data environments.
The project is projected to take a year, and started in
August of 2019.
Partner Engagement
We continue to plan how to engage local partners, large
and small, and are seeking to engage more partners from
the local business community. Our partnerships with
Cleveland Orchestra, Karamu, UMA, Old Brooklyn
Historical, and others need support in the form of
developed plans for the future, and we continue to
discover new partners with whom to work on projects
such as the Cleveland Grays, Crile Archives, and East
Cleveland Public Library.
Digital Collection Gateway
Cleveland Digital Public Library has contributed
ContentDM metadata to international catalogs through
OCLC’s Digital Collection Gateway, and we have been
invited to participate in a pilot project involving
linked data. We will be working with technical services
over the summer to develop a plan for better integrating
into our local OPAC our ContentDM metadata pulled into
WorldCat. The first goal is to hold a meeting to discuss
it.

their puppets as we gear up for our child-led puppet
show. Children learned the basics of puppet creation,
puppet variations and getting comfortable manipulating
the puppets they have created.

OUTREACH & PROGRAMMING SERVICES
The Cleveland Public Library summer reading program,
Summer Lit League (SLL), was thematically aligned with
The World of Puppets: From Stage to Screen, an exhibit
in Brett Hall. Critical aspects of the exhibition
include traditional and modern puppets from around the
world. As it relates to summer programming, The World
of Puppets vital aspects were the foundation for
introducing puppetry to local youth and families.
Programming content focused on puppet making and
performance activities. Throughout the summer program,
participants explored a variety of enrichment activities
that promoted youth –led programming, the arts,
community building, reading, writing and other forms of
creative expression.
With the help of the Youth Services Department, the
Cleveland Public Library Outreach and Programming
Services youth staff developed the summer reading
program content.
All involved parties assisted in
creating weekly canned programs. Additionally, the
Outreach and Programming Services team collectively
provided input on incentives, website and reading log
content.
Outreach and Programming Youth Manager and Coordinators
worked with in the reduced costs budget compared to
2017. Beanstack, an online user platform for families
and children remained the Summer Lit League tracking
tool for reading. The Cleveland Public Library
currently subscribes to the Beanstack database; there is
no additional fee. Furthermore, using common craft

 1203

supplies for the weekly canned programs resulted in the
same supply cost reduction as 2018 at 48%. Youth staff
were allotted a discretionary budget of $150 for each
branch location.
Summer Lit League programming began Monday, June 3,
2019, with the associated programming continuing for
eight weeks. At the conclusion of this year’s SLL,
12,205 students with 7,137 completing.

SPS completed Library Building Security checklists’
for all CPL branches. Branch managers were advised
to submit Hippo tickets to address discrepancies
and issues found at branches. Building contents,
material management, entry and interior space
control, windows, barriers, lights, intrusion and
fire protection, stack access, and security gates
were all evaluated at our locations.
SPS along with Property Management removed the
cylinder locks from the LSW Special Collections and
Map room vault doors in an effort to enhance loss
prevention measures. Access control card readers
are the only means of entering the vault, therefore
an electronic history of access is stored.



SPS filled the following overtime requests: Fleet
coverage (early morning special attention), special
assignments at South Brooklyn after July 23rd, Rice
branch Community Meeting, CPL 150, and Collinwood
fire watch.
SPS and CPD responded to South Brooklyn branch for
a shooting July 23rd. Video provided to CPD led to
the quick apprehension of the two suspects.
A meeting was held June 10, 2019 with all CPL Third
District managers, SPS, CPD’s Third District
Commander Anne Todd, and Mrs. Parks.
Video requests fulfilled for Cleveland Police
Department, Homeland Security, RTA PD, and US
Postal Police.
SPS officers deployed pepper gel on a patron at
Sterling branch who was throwing rocks and swinging
yard tools (stolen from CMHA) at SPS officers. The
male punched a responding CPD officer and was
arrested.
SPS Manager Duncan will attend the Ohio Metro
Libraries Security Meeting September 16th.
SPS participated in CPL Safety Task Force Meetings.
Over 30 new cameras were installed at LSW and
Main’s interior and exterior.

Protective and Fire Systems




Fire and burglar system troubles were addressed at
Rice, Harvard Lee, Fulton, Mt. Pleasant, and
Collinwood.
A new fire alarm panel was installed at Collinwood
branch last month. The intrusion panel will be
installed this month.
Fire drills were completed for the third quarter at
all locations. Cleveland Fire Department’s Fire
Marshal oversaw the LSW and Main fire drill.

 1219



SPS audited all Access Control ID cards in August
and adjusted access levels based on transfers,
resignations, and terminations.

Contract Security
 SPS moved the Memorial Nottingham guard to Rice
branch. The SPS officer posted at Lake Shore and
Royce guard from Lake Shore now patrol and respond
to all requests for service at Memorial Nottingham.
 SPS had the E. 131 guard removed for leaving her
post early, the Rockport guard was removed for
insubordination, Collinwood’s guard was removed
for speaking inappropriately to female staff,
 The Eastside Royce supervisor was replaced per SPS
request for subpar performance.
Administration





SPS Supervisors received white uniform shirts.
This will help clearly identify Safety & Protective
Services Supervisors from Field Officers.
A procedure was developed for non SPS staff to
clarify when it is appropriate to call CPD instead
of SPS. SPS also has proposed changes to how Lost
& Found items are gathered and stored and developed
an Emergency Lockdown protocols. The documents are
with the Knowledge Office for review.
SPS hired three new PTR Officers. One is training
now and the other two start in a couple of weeks.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & CLEVNET
CLEVNET Quarterly Meeting
The CLEVNET Directors held their third quarterly meeting
of 2019 on Friday, July 26, 2019, at the Kelleys Island
Branch of Sandusky Library. Leslie Korenko, an author
and board member of The Kelleys Island Historical
Association, gave a short presentation on the history of
the island and shared her personal perspective as
someone who lives on the island year round and benefits
from the services of CLEVNET.
Lorena Williams, Chair of the Directors Panel and
Director of Hubbard Public Library, welcomed Kara
Cervelli, the new director of Fairport Harbor Public

 1220

Library. Director Williams congratulated Carlos Latimer
on his appointment to director of East Cleveland Public
Library, after serving as interim director. Hilary
Prisbylla, Director of CLEVNET, was also congratulated
on her appointment to the board of OPLIN (Ohio Public
Library Information Network) for a three-year term that
began July 1, 2019.
Tim Diamond, CPL’s Special Assistant to the Director and
liaison to CLEVNET, provided a brief update on CLEVNET’s
strategic plan with a focus on governance. The West
Region has a vacancy on the CLEVNET Executive Panel due
to Stephanie Buchanan’s departure from Bellevue Public
Library. (Ms. Buchanan is now the director of Bucyrus
Public Library.) Two directors volunteered to put their
names on the ballot. The East Region has two seats with
terms ending in December 2019, which will have to be
filled by the end of the year.
Mr. Diamond discussed CLEVNET’s 2019 priorities and
goals (distributed at the meeting as a handout) and how,
any suggested changes or additions to this list must be
brought to the Executive Panel for vetting. A strategic
framework for the Panel to use when evaluating proposed
projects and initiatives is described in CLEVNET’s
operating procedures. Mr. Diamond explained that the
list is being used to report back to the membership, in
a systematic and consistent fashion, on the status of
the many projects underway.
The next part of the meeting focused on the work of the
Library Systems and Applications Team headed by Hilary
Prisbylla. Ms. Prisbylla updated the CLEVNET directors
on the new mobile app templates; credit card
transactions; how OverDrive Advantage Plus accounts for
each library system could provide better circulation
data than the current structure; additional periodical
offerings purchased from OverDrive with funds previously
used for support services that are now part of the
platform costs; LibCal, the event management and room
booking software available as a service to member
libraries; and the “go green” campaign to reduce paper
notices.
Ms. Prisbylla also announced that she would be sending
out a survey regarding the databases purchased by
CLEVNET to get feedback from the member libraries on

 1221

what should be kept and what should possibly be dropped
and/or added. Finally, Ms. Prisbylla explained the
upcoming ILS cleanup on August 8, 2019, and what impact
the work would have on circulation operations and
technical services.
Larry Finnegan, Director of IT, updated the CLEVNET
directors on special projects and initiatives,
including: expanding capacity of the data center in
Columbus; updating access points as part of the network
infrastructure; SharePoint Office 365 successful
transitions at Wayne County and Sandusky; VoIP
installations at Twinsburg and Norwalk; purchasing
licenses through TechSoup; the remote monitoring and
management solution from ConnectWise Automate now used
by all member libraries; computer and print management;
Rubrik backup and recovery services; InformaCast mass
notification of staff; and ConnectWise Manage, the help
desk software product. As always, security remains a top
concern and priority for his team.
Don Yarman, Executive Director of OPLIN, attended the
meeting along with Karl Jendretzky, OPLIN’s Technology
Project Manager. Mr. Yarman expressed his thanks to Ms.
Prisbylla for her willingness to serve on OPLIN’s board,
especially at this time, as it faces difficult
challenges with Lynda.com, a provider of online classes
and one of the most popular services purchased by OPLIN
for Ohio’s public libraries. Lynda.com is now LinkedIn
Learning and the acquisition has created a host of
privacy and accessibility issues with the new owner. The
OPLIN Board will grapple with the question of what to do
with the contract at their August meeting.
The meeting ended but the networking continued over
lunch and the ferry ride back to Marblehead. The next
quarterly meeting of the CLEVNET Directors will be held
on Friday, October 25, 2019, at Cleveland Public
Library, in the Louis Stokes Wing Learning Commons at
10:00 am.
In other news this summer, staff re-encoded the Sirsi
database in Unicode format and re-indexed all of the
existing data. The new format went live on August 12.
Unicode is a universal encoding scheme adopted by the
computer industry which is designed to support the
worldwide interchange, processing, and display of

 1222

diverse languages. The format of the catalog data had
been ASCII; ASCII was originally designed for English
only. Unicode, on the other hand, allows for better
visual representation, and searching of international
language records in the catalog. It is also the modern
standard for record processing and encoding. In addition
the browse index had not been fully re-indexed in many
years due to processing time. The full re-index will
improve searching for all records. Staff had originally
planned to upgrade to Unicode in 2006, but costs and
downtime required to migrate (over a week) made it
prohibitive. Technology upgrades in recent years have
made the process much easier.
CPL’s VMware environment was successfully moved to the
SOCC (State of Ohio Computer Center) in Columbus, with
no down time. The only servers left to move are Munis
and those for Property Management. The vendor will move
Munis to the SOCC VMware environment in September.
Seimens will install their software for Property
Management on a server already stood up on CPL’s VMware
environment. When these moves are completed, the server
room at Main Library will have four cages, down from 16.
The Network Team was also busy throughout the summer
moving CPL branch circuits from the head end at Main
Library to the new AT&T head end at the SOCC. Nearby, at
the SOCC, all 200+ CLEVNET servers are now on the latest
version of VMware, 6.7. Both datacenters are up and
running, managed by VMware vCenter Server.
The new CLEVNET mobile app was released on August 20,
2019. There was nothing new for patrons to download. The
existing CLEVNET app began displaying library profiles
and assumed the functionality of the testing app. The
testing app no longer worked.
Staff replaced and configured all CPL printers; group
policy settings were revamped to improve the user
experience and uniformity. Staff also installed seven
access points in the Eastman Reading Garden and reimaged
89 public PCs in Tech Central, upgrading from Windows 7
to Windows 10.
Hilary Prisbylla, Larry Finnegan, and Tim Diamond
visited Kara Cervelli, the new director of Fairport
Harbor Public Library, on August 2, 2019, for her
orientation to CLEVNET.

 1223

Ms. Rodriguez adjourned the Regular Board Meeting at
1:38 p.m.

Leaders Risk Protector. With this new form included in the definition of damages is front and back pay. For
your reference we have included a coverage analysis table that AIG has provided that addresses the changes
in coverage to their new form. With this change in form EEOC Hearing Coverage is now included and there is
no longer a need for a specific endorsement providing coverage.

Ohio Gas Choice Customer Contract

Energy

General Terms and Conditions (v. 2016-09-27)

·

Large Commercial

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms and Conditions") shall be read together with the Gas Choice Customer Contract ­
Large Commercial (> 500 Men and any exhibits thereto (collectively, the "Contract") and explain the terms and
conditions that govern your purchase of commercial natural gas service from CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. ("Seller"
or "CenterPoint"). CenterPoint is licensed as a Competitive Retail Natural Gas Supplier ("CRNGS") by the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio ("PUCO"). Your Contract with CenterPoint for natural gas service includes these terms and
conditions. By accepting natural gas service from CenterPoint, you have agreed to be bound by the terms of your
Contract.
In these Terms and Conditions, "Buyer", "Customer", "you'', "I" and "your" mean the account holder who completes and
signs your Contract or a person expressly authorized to do so by the account holder. "Premises" mean the address
specified in your Contract, and any future addresses that the account holder may move to during the term of your
Contract, which are located in Ohio and to which CenterPoint has the ability and capacity to supply gas. If you move to a
new location other than the Premises, you agree to notify CenterPoint as soon as possible prior to any such move, in
order to determine whether such new location is served by CenterPoint or whether other arrangements must be made.
Your Contract is for the supply of natural gas. This does not include natural gas delivery service, which will be provided
by your utility. You will receive one bill from your utility that will include (i) CenterPoint's charges for the supply of natural
gas and (ii) your utility's charges for natural gas delivery service. The obligation of CenterPoint to sell and schedule
natural gas for delivery to you and your obligation to purchase natural gas from CenterPoint is contingent upon (a) your
eligibility and successful enrollment, as determined by your utility, to take supply from an CRNGS, and (b) the accuracy
and completeness of information provided by you during the enrollment process.

2. PRICING AND FEES: Your monthly natural gas bill will be calculated by multiplying the price of natural gas per usage
unit (e.g., Therm, Ccf, Men by the amount of natural gas used during the billing cycle, as measured or estimated by your
utility. Your price under this Contract does not include, and you are required to pay, your utility's delivery service
charges, customer charges, and all other applicable charges and taxes. For the term of this Contract, you agree to pay
all amounts that are charged by CenterPoint consistent with this Contract. We may charge a fee for early cancellation of
your Contract ("Early Termination Fee"). Such Early Termination Fee is set forth in Section 5, "Early Termination By
Customers".

3. BILLING AND PAYMENT: Bills you receive from your utility for natural gas delivery charges will also include

CenterPoint's charges pursuant to this Contract, and you will remit payment for CenterPoint's charges directly to your
utility. Your utility will determine the rules governing your billing and payment. Failure to pay the natural gas utility
charges may result in disconnection of your natural gas service in accordance with the applicable natural gas utility tariff.
CenterPoint early termination fees will be billed to you directly by CenterPoint. You have the right to request up to
twenty-four months of your payment history for services rendered by a CRNGS without any charge to you.

4. CONTRACT TERM AND CONTINUATION : The Initial Term of your Contract Is Indicated in the "Contract Facts"

section on the first page of the Gas Choice Customer Contract. CenterPoint may deny enrollment for any reason.
Service under this Contract will begin on the first available date, no earlier than the start date of the Initial Term, as
determined by your Utility, and after successful enrollment with CenterPoint. A delay in the start of service may occur for
reasons beyond CenterPoint's control, such as a delay by the Customer's Gas Utility in providing CenterPoint with
requested information or in processing your Contract. You agree that you will not purchase natural gas for the Premises
identified on Exhibit A from any other supplier (including any Gas Utility) during the Initial Term of your Contract. For
fixed-term products, CenterPoint will provide a written notice of Contract expiration between 45 and 90 days prior to
Contract expiration. Unless you authorize a new contract with CenterPoint or your service with CenterPoint is
terminated, at the expiration of your Contract your natural gas service will continue with CenterPoint on a market-based
month-to-month variable rate, cancellable at any time without penalty. This market-based month-to-month variable rate
may remain the same or may change based on CenterPoint's assessment of gas supply costs including, but not limited
to, applicable market conditions, risk factors, historical costs, actual costs, and future cost projections. Specific costs
that may be considered include, but are not limited to, transportation, fuel, storage, pooling fees, balancing, and basis.
For example: If CenterPoint purchases gas at $3.50 per Mcf and creates an adder of $0.70 per Mcf (based on factors
similar to the factors identified above), then the cost to you would be $4.20 per Mcf. If the adder is $1 .00 per Mel, then
the cost to you would be $4.50 per Mcf.
5. EARLY TERMINATION BY CUSTOMERS : If Buyer is under a fixed-term Contract and terminates the Contract before
the end of the Contract term, Buyer agrees to pay the Early Termination Fee. The Early Termination Fee shall be the
greater of $1 00/monthlmeter for every month remaining on the contract, or Liquidated Damages (as defined below) on
any volumes purchased or secured by CenterPoint on the Customer's behalf and not delivered to Customer due to
Customer's early termination of Contract. "Liquidated Damages" are an amount determined by CenterPoint by
multiplying the Projected Future Volume (as defined below) by the difference in the per Unit price in this Contract (the
"Contract Price") and the market wholesale price (the "Market Price"), where the Market Price shall be the average of the
NYMEX plus Basis cost for each month remaining on this Contract, plus any losses incurred on the sale of gas in
storage purchased for the Customer and not consumed by the Customer due to early termination of Contract. Projected
Future Volume is CenterPoint's forecasted volume for Customer's accounts in this Contract. After providing notice of
termination of your Contract, your utility will perform a final meter read. You will be responsible for all charges incurred
through the date your utility performs the final meter read. CenterPoint's obligations will end after the final meter read
when CenterPoint is no longer designated as your CRNGS. Termination of your Contract does not excuse your
obligation to pay outstanding balance or the Early Termination Fee or any other charges or fees incurred under this
Contract prior to the date that termination becomes effective. Customer has the right to terminate Contract without
penalty if Customer moves outside of Utility's service area or within the Utility's service area that does not permit
portability of contract.
6; TERMINATION BY CENTERPOINT: CenterPoint may terminate this Contract upon 45 days written notice if we are no

Technical Proposal for:
The New Cleveland Public Lib rary Hough Branch
Submitted to:
Mr. Jeremiah Swetel, Chief Operations Officer
Moody Nolan Project Number 19240.01
September 20, 2019
The following generally defines the work to be provided by the architectural-engineering team for the new
Cleveland Public Library Hough Branch, as proposed by Moody Nolan, Inc. This proposal is to demonstrate
the architects' u nderstanding of the project scope and the design process. This technical proposal is
submitted by Anne M. Hartman, AIA, Project Executive for the Prime Consultant/Architect of Record firm,
Moody Nolan, Inc. The Federal Tax ID number for our firm is 311256984.

1. Understanding of Project Scope:
The new Hough Branch library is anticipated to be a single-story, 10,000 square foot building at the
southwest corner of the intersection of Lexington Avenue and East 661h Street. The site proposed for the
new library is currently Land Bank parcels owned by the City of Cleveland and a street needing to be
vacated by the City. Although the parcels are owned by the Land Bank and were formerly developed, the
parcels are not registered as brownfield sites with the Ohio EPA. Documentation and permitting of the
demolition of structures is not anticipated. EPA Phase I assessment and requirements for any bat surveys
shall be the responsibility of the Owner.
Project phases with duration and deliverables have been proposed for consideration by Cleveland Public
Library. The duration and deliverables per phase may be adjusted or revised if deemed necessary by
Cleveland Public Library.
Standards developed by Cleveland Public Library shall be incorporated into the Project. CPL shall provide
their standards for review and use by the design team including requirements of CPL's insurance
underwriter.
Though not in scope, this proposal includes a separate fee for LEED Certification and required
documentation.
Moody Nolan will perform services for Project Phases as described in the State of Ohio contract documents.
This would will also include, but not be limited to, the following:

Project Understanding and Scope of Services - Exhibit A
Proposal for Professional Services
Jefferson Branch Renovation and Addition Project
850 Jefferson Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44113

Dear Jeremiah On behalf of the Wanix Architects + Williams Architects Team, Williams Architects is pleased to present this proposal for
professional services in connections with the Cleveland Public Library Jefferson Branch Renovation and Addition Project. We
look forward to working with the Library to implement your vision for this Project!
PROJECT BACKGROU ND / UN DERSTANDING
In 2019, the Cleveland Public Library completed a comprehensive Master Plan for the Library system that honors the past
while creating a view of the bright future that is ahead. It is the third major facilities/building program in the 150-year life of
the Library. Bialosky Cleveland worked with the Library to gather input from the community, establish design principles,
address programmatic needs, respond to and evaluate the emerging trends in libraries, and create a vision and path forward
for this significant undertaking. As part of the Master Plan, Bialosky developed preliminary project definitions which included
potential scopes of work and design concepts for each branch. Regency Construction Services worked with Bialosky Cleveland
and the Library to classify levels of renovation and establish probable square foot costs for the implementation and deferred
maintenance costs. These preliminary project definitions are somewhat fluid and may change as part of the program
verification process.

The Jefferson Branch is a well-liked branch that is too small to adequately serve its patrons. As noted on the Library's web
site and/or the Master Plan, it is an historic Carnegie Library building which was constructed in 1918 and renovated in 1981.
It is a red brick building with a flat roof and multiple sawtooth skylights. The building maintains its historic character and is
located on a tight site in the historic Tremont neighborhood. The backyard space and some land adjacent to the existing 14space parking lot may allow for a modern expansion. The site includes a bio swale/rain garden between the parking lot and
the library building.
In its early history, Cleveland Public Library constructed several branch libraries that could be easily adapted into a store or
business as the local population and l ibrary service needs fluctuated. Jefferson is an example of this convertible-type building
as evidenced by its plain brick, factory-type skylights, and the fact that it is semi-fireproof.
The 6,900 square foot library currently includes a meeting room, collections, reading area, a computer area, and children's
reading area. There is a basement level mechanical room and a small second floor that are not open to the public. The
relatively open interior layout lends itself to renovation. The Future Vision for the Project in the Master Plan includes:
•
Create a small addition to give the building a n i mproved entry from the parking lot, while potentially improving
visibility from Jefferson Avenue;
•
Maintain existing historic entry on Jefferson Avenue;
•
Renovate branch to make more efficient use of the space; create a defined teen space;

A BIM Implementation Plan is defined prior to the commencement of work defining
project schedule, model exchange schedule, model element authoring and
coordination of shared devices.

Exceptions to LOO 300 are as follows:
1 ) The LOO will correlate to the ·detail expected per associated project deliverables
described in the schematic design, design development, and construction documents
secflons.
2) Our engineering model is to be considered diagrammatic due to graphic limitations,
such as actual spacing of piping or true scaling of devices, which may need to be altered
to allow for legibly printed documents. Final routing of all systems and services is the

 1348

responsibility of the Contractors and must be evaluated by the Contractors prior lo
fabrication and installation.
3) The engineering model will only account for the manufacturers used as the basis of
design. If another manufactu rer is provided, the alternate dimensions and clearanc;e
requirements for that equipment is the responsibility of the Contractors.
4) The engineering model is not lo be considered as reflecting as-built conditions for
existing areas. The design information identifies general points of connection to existing
installations and approximate pathways of existing services. Contractors are required to
field verify pathways and dimensional constraints to accommodate existing conditions.
d.

The coordinated engineering model submitted with Construction Documents is not intended to
be a clash free model.
It is assumed that a Construction Manager or the Architect will be the administrator of
clash detection reports and meetings to facilitate the construction model.
2) A physical clash detection report generated by Karpinski Engineering (using a BIM
management software such as Navisworks) can be provided as an additional service.
3) Coordination of the engineering model beyond the level described will be considered
an additional service.

1)

e.

Engineering model elements will be populated with data to coordinate construction
documentation annotation such as schedu l es, tags, and notes.
1)

Incorporation of additional data into engineering model elements beyond Karpinski
Engineering's customized Revit standards can be provided as an additional service.

Attempts to coordinate installation details beyond what was agreed to during initial BIM planning,
that will not affect bidding, and which is not consistent with construction means and methods,
will be considered an additional service.
g. The engineering model is not intended for use by Contractors as a construction and/or
coordination model. Exact placement of equipment and devices are dependent on and affected
by construction field conditions and therefore is the responsibility of the Contractors.
h. We have included one BIM model exchange every two weeks. Should the client post model
updates more frequently, we cannot guarantee they will be utilized. More frequent model
exchanges will be considered an additional service.

f.

Re: Construction Supplier Diversity - Proposal #8 Engagement thru January 30 2019
-

Dear Jeremiah,
Thank you for the opportunity to present the below proposal, presented in response to our conversation
from yesterday; and your follow-up email.
The basis for the proposal is the scope of work detailed in your email of 9/23/19 and all remaining,
uninvoiced work. Please note the following; the costs included below are supplemental to invoices
previously submitted for payment; proposed work for the CMR selection process is based on actuals fo r
the AE selection process; and estimates of mileage are only applicable when I travel to the CPL offices
from another location. If I am scheduled in my downtown office, there is no mileage charge to CPL.

STAFF WELFARE AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS · 400
Fleet Vehicle and Transportation · 430
431 · Fleet Vehicles

Employees needing transportation for business or other purposes related to
Cleveland Public Library activities may use one of the Library's vehicles.
431 . 1 Requests fo r the use of a Library car for out of town travel are to be made
on Form 070 and must include the expected times of pick-up and return;
local travel requests are made via phone or email to the Property
Management department.
All requests must be approved by a
department or agency head and forwarded to the Property Management
Department well in advance of the need fo r the car.
431 .2 Except in unusual or emergency circumstances and with prior approval of
a department or agency head, a Library employee must be the d river of
the car. Any person d riving a Library car must have a valid driver's
license. Article 23 of the Local 860 Union Agreement and Article XXl l a of
the SEIU District 1 1 99 Union Agreement govern the Library's driver's
record check procedures fo r union employees.
431 .3 Library fleet vehicles must not be utilized by Li brary employees for any
personal use without permission of a department or agency head. All
usage of Library fleet vehicles must be substantiated on the "IRS Mileage
Log Sheet," maintained in each fleet vehicle.
Each time a Library
employee utilizes a fleet vehicle, he/she must document the travel date(s),
his/her name, destination, business purpose for use of the vehicle, and
beginning and ending odometer readings on the mileage log sheet.
Additionally, no Library employee is permitted to take a fleet vehicle home
for overnight use (e.g., borrow a fleet vehicle at the end of the day to take
home and utilize fo r travel the fo llowing day). This usage would be
considered personal, and, therefore, taxable to the employee.
43 1 .4 Personal use of a Library fleet vehicle is taxable to the employee as a
fringe benefit under the IRS's "cents-per-mile" rule. Personal use is any
use of the Library vehicle other than use for Library business. Under the
"cents-per-mile" rule, the Library must determine the value of a vehicle
that the Library provides to an employee for personal use by multiplying
the standard mileage rate by the total miles the employee drives the
vehicle for personal purposes. This amount must be included in the
employee's wages or reimbursed by the employee.

Employee-Provided Transportation (Personal Vehicle and Public
Transportation)

Employees authorized by their department heads to use their personal vehicles
for Library purposes are entitled to a mileage allowance equal to the I nternal
Revenue Service's standard mileage rate. Employees always have the option of
calculating the actual fuel costs of using their vehicle rather than using the
standard mileage rates.
432.1 If an employee utilizes his/her own vehicle fo r Library business, he/she
must possess a valid driver's license and must carry insurance coverage
on said vehicle. The employee's vehicle must be in safe working order
and good repair. The Library will not be held responsible for or pay fo r
any damages, necessary repairs, or malfunctions that occur to an
employee's vehicle while in use on Library business. In the event of an
accident, vandalism, or similar occurrence, the employee's personal auto
insu rance policy would be the primary coverage, and the Library's auto
Whenever possible,
insu rance policy would be excess coverage.
employees are encouraged to carpool or arrange for the use of a Library
vehicle.
432.2 Employees needing transportation from one assignment to another within
the Library system will be entitled to receive bus fare to and from the
second assignment unless it completes a day's schedule, in which case
transportation will be paid only one way.
432.3 Employees will not be reimbursed for commuting, which is travel between
an employee's personal residence and the first/last place of work within
the Library system. This includes mileage, bus fare, parking, tolls, etc.
Reim bursements fo r transportation expenses for traveling from one work
location to another for Library business will be reimbursed in accordance
with the guidelines stated in this policy.
432.4 Employees will not be reimbursed for both vehicle mileage costs and bus
fare on the same day. If an employee claims both vehicle mileage and
bus fare on the same day, the employee will be reimbursed fo r the lesser
of vehicle mileage costs or bus fare for that entire day's travel (up to the
maximum all-day bus pass amount currently in effect at the time of travel).
432.5 I n no instance will the Library reimburse costs incurred by an employee for
ride-sharing services (e.g., Uber, Lyft, taxis, etc.) for transportation
between branches unless the use of ride-sharing services is in the best
interest of the Library and is approved in advance by the employee's
supervisor.

 1527

432.6 Reimbursement Procedures
432.6.1 Claims for reimbursement for employee-provided transportation
must be made on Form 024, "Claim for Mileage/Transport
Reimbursement," through Employee Self Service (ESS).
For
vehicle mileage, employees must include a route map printout or
similar support as a receipt to substantiate the reimbursement
request. Employees are to utilize Form 023, Mileage Matrix, to
substantiate mileage between Library facilities. For all-day bus
fare requests, employees must include the all-day pass. Other
expenses, such as parking or tolls, must be accompanied by a
receipt.
432.6.2 Employees must submit claims on a monthly basis in ESS.
Claims for reimbursement must be submitted by the end of the
following month (e.g., travel for the month of June must be
subm itted in ESS by July 3 1 81). Reimbursements will not be made
if claims are submitted past this date.
432.6.3 Any personal tax implications related to fleet vehicles and/or
employee-provided transportation a re the sole responsibility of the
employee, not the Cleveland Public Library.
