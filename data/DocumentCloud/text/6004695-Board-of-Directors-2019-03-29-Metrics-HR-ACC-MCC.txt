*1 The 3rd Quarter S-FY 18 was significant for CountyCare Compliance. Evolent, CountyCare’s TPA for medical and behavioral health hired
two (2) local investigators dedicated solely to program integrity efforts. This dedicated team partnered with a data analytics firm to review
claims for anomalies. The result of this activity is apparent in the metrics above.
*2 The Overpayments Identified column indicates the total amount paid to the provider for the identified inaccurate codes. These amounts
may be offset if a provider elects to bill a corrected claim.
Example: The highest level clinic visit is billed to the health plan, reimbursement is $48, the medical record is reviewed and the
documentation validates a lower level. The “Overpayment Identified” is $48, however the provider may rebill a lower level and
expect corresponding reimbursement of $28.35. This category does not account for the net recovery of $19.65.
