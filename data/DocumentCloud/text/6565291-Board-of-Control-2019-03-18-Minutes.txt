V – OTHER BUSINESS
Item of Clarification
On December 17, 2018 the Board approved the following item. The Fiscal Officer asked during the
Executive Review Meeting and then again via e-mail if any of the 25k being requested will be used to pay
invoices for services provided in 2018 or is it all for services to be provided in 2019. Jeanelle Greene
responded on both occasions by stating the expenses were for 2019 only.
The Department used $9,000.00 to pay for invoices for 2018.
The Fiscal Officer would like the Department to clarify to the Board that expenses were for 2018 and 2019,
as it is important for the Departments to be clear on what additional funds are being used for when the
Board is considering items for approval.
BC2018-914
Department of Information Technology, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1200571 with iData
Consulting Services, Inc., for maintenance and support services on the Synapse Publisher Web Content
Management System for the period 8/20/2012 - 8/19/2019 for additional funds in the amount not-toexceed $25,000.00.
Funding Source: General Fund

 Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology, presented. Joseph Nanni asked if remaining
unspent funds for this amendment will cover services through 2019 and if another contract will be
submitted upon contract expiration. Nan Baker asked for clarification on the amounts paid in 2018 and
2019, as the materials provided to Board members indicate that $9,000.00 was used for 2018 expenses,
not $6,000.00 as stated in Ms. Greene’s presentation. Matt Carroll confirmed that the statement
regarding 2018 funds, provided to the Board members, reads $9,000.00, not $6,000.00. Joseph Nanni
asked for confirmation if 2019 funds were being used to pay 2018 invoices and asked Ms. Greene to review
and confirm whether the document detailing the expenses given to the Board was accurate or not.
Ms. Greene indicated these numbers were not accurate and restated that approximately $6,000.00 was
paid for 2018 services and the remaining balance of $19,000.00 would be used for 2019 costs; however
other funds may have been encumbered for 2018 services separate from the $25,000.00 amendment.
Matt Carroll stated that the materials say that the $25,000.00 was to be used for 2019 and that further
discussions may be held outside of the meeting since this item does not require a vote. Joseph Nanni
stated for the record, that the document provided to the Board members, appears to be incorrect and
conflicts with what was being stated in Ms. Greene’s presentation.
Mr. Carroll asked for further review of this matter and asked the department to provide a response to the
Board members confirming actual payment amounts made for 2018 and 2019 expenses. Andria
Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control, indicated that the amount listed in the materials provided to
the Board, which lists the 2018 amount as $9,000.00, was provided by the Fiscal Officer.
This item did not require a vote.
