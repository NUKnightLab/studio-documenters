Summary: The Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Forest Preserves”) recently concluded
negotiations for the sale of a Surplus Parcel that has been approved for sale by the State Legislature,
Surplus Parcel A, consisting of approximately 0.208 acres (the “Surplus Parcel”). The Surplus Parcel is
not contiguous with or connected to any other Forest Preserves property. The Surplus Parcel is
immediately adjacent to, and completely surrounded by, the neighboring property, 5035 North River
Road, Schiller Park, Illinois.During the mid-1980’s, Forest Preserves staff undertook a comprehensive
study of all Forest Preserves holdings, resulting in a list of 30 parcels being considered for disposal.
Subsequently, the Forest Preserves sought and obtained permission, on 9/23/1985 via Public Act 84-867,
from the State Legislature to offer 27 of the 30 aforementioned parcels for sale with the monies to accrue
to the Forest Preserves Real Estate Acquisition Fund. On 8/16/2001, via Public Act 92-0403, the State
Legislature authorized the sale of an additional 5 surplus parcels including the Surplus Parcel.
The adjacent property owner, 5035 N. River Road, LLC (the “Buyer”), has agreed to buy the Surplus
Parcel from the Forest Preserves for the sum of NINETY-THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND
00/100 ($93,000.00). The purchase price is consistent with M.A.I. certified appraisals obtained by the
Forest Preserves.
