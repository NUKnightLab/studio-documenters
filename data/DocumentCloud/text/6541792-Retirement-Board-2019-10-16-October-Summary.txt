CONGRATULATIONS TO BC JOSE MORENO
On behalf of the entire FABF membership, I would like to congratulate Battalion Chief Jose
Moreno on his retirement. As anyone who has been promoted in the last 10 to 15 years
would agree, I, especially, want to thank him for all the outstanding work he did in publishing
the CFD Officer Guides and for generously donating a portion of the proceeds to the EMWQ
Widows and Children Fund. Chief Moreno, thank you for your time and your service, we
all wish you a long and healthy retirement.

Fund Secretary,
Captain Anthony Martin
