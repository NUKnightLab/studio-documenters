BOARD REPORT 
AND ADOPT A NEW VOLUNTEER POLICY

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Board rescind Board Report and adopt a new Volunteer Policy effective at the
start of the 2014-2015 school year.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to promote and encourage volunteerism in the Chicago Public
Schools and to expand and enhance parental, community, civic and business invoivement with schools
while also ensuring appropriate levels of safety and security.

POLICY TEXT:

School Code ("Enumerated Offense") shall be ineligible to be a voiunteer. .An individual who has
been convicted of an offense that requires him/her to appear on a sex offender registry in anyjurisdiction
