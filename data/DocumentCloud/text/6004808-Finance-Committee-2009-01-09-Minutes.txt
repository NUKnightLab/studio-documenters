Summag;
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System year to date ?nancial

results ?nished the eleventh month of the ?scal year behind the
budget by 19%. The poorer than planned ?nancial performance was
due to lower Patient Service Revenue, IGT Revenue, and Non?
Operating Revenue. The overall revenue shortfall at the end of the
eleventh month was $68,716,038 below the budget for the same
period in time. Expenses were also below budget by $54,667,788.
The favorable level of expenses was not enough to offset the shortfall
in revenue.

Qperating Revenue

Fees at the end of October collected from patient services were below
budget year to date by 12.3%. It is eXpected that by the end of ?scal
year there will be an improvement in collected fees as compared to
the budget. Patient fees are expected to fall short of the budget by
approximately 7% or $21 million dollars by the end of the ?scal year.
The largest source of unfavorable patient service revenue is from the
shortfall of Medicaid patient fees.

The Intergovernmental Transfer Revenue continues to be short of the
budget due to the phase out of one federal program. The System has
been working with the of?cials of the State Medicaid program to
offset the loss of IGT revenue. The 2008 loss of IGT is $15,004,000.
The efforts of the System management and the consultants have
arranged for the System to receive approximately $11,697,000 by the
end of the ?scal year. IGT revenue will by the end of the ?scal year
still be below the budget by approximately $3,300,000.

Other Revenue at the end of October is in excess of the budget by
$1,732,114 or 33.5%. If this trend continues through the end of the
?scal year Other Revenue will be in excess of the budget by
approximately 1.9 million dollars.

Total Operating Revenue at the end of the ?scal year may be below
budget by approximately 30 million dollars.

15

Querating?xpenses

Operating Expenses at the end of October were below budget by .
5.7% or $54,667,788. This favorable expense performance was due
to positive variances for Supplies, Purchased Services, and Utilities.
Salaries and Employee Bene?ts were over the budget by relatively
small amdunts year to date.

Salaries and Wages ($8,637,963 or 

Salaries and wages continue to exceed the budget at the end of
October. The use of overtime and replacement time for the holiday in
October contributed to this unfavorable variance. Overtime is being
monitored by the System management and is used to ?ll staf?ng
needs. There are a large number of staff positions that remain
un?lled and these vacancies create the need to use overtime.

Stroger and Provident Hospitals are over budget year to date for
salaries and wages, while Oak Forest Hospital is below budget.

Bene?ts - ($1,546,195 or 

The level of Benefit expense is directly related to salary and wage
expense. Bene?ts for employees are over budget because salaries and
wages are also in excess of budget.

Supplies $26,976,270 or 20% .

Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget
year to date. The System is still using the accrual convention to
measure supply expense based on the actual expenditures at the end
of the period plus 40%.

Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $34,792,188 or 25.2%
The year to date level expenses for the System for this category
continues to be signi?cantly below the budget. The method used to
estimate expense is the same for purchased services as is used for
supplies. 

16

Utilities - $3,083,488 or 16%

The estimated System year to date expense for utilities in total is
below the budget. The most favorable utility expense performance as
compared to the budget is for Stroger Hospital. Expenses for utilities
at Stroger are below the budget by $2,922,889 or 20.9%. Oak
Forest?s utility expense is below the budget by $236,602 or 
Provident HOSpital?s utility expense is in excess of the budget by
$76,002 or 

System Expenses per Adjusted Patient Day
A comparison of year to date expenses per adjusted patient day to the
budget is as follows:

Institution Budget Actual Variance
Stroger $5,583 .02 $5,295.77 5.1%
Oak Forest $5,143.84 $3,676.86 28.52%
Provident $5,221.59 $3 ,841 .3 6 26.4%

Non Operating Revenue

Non operating revenue at the end of September was below budget by
4.8% or $22,618,476. The largest shortfall from budget is for sales

tax. It is still expected that the receipts for sales tax will increase in
October and November. The increased receipts for the last two
months of the ?scal year will be the result of the increase in the rate
of sales tax that occurred on July .1, 2008. The actual receipts from
the increase will begin to be recorded in the last two months of the
fiscal year.

The decline in the level of cigarette tax revenue from the level
expected in the budget is not expected to increase in the remaining
two months of the ?scal year- The decline could be a combinationof
factors causing the reduced revenue such as fewer people are
smokers, a decline in the population, and the poor economic
conditions in Illinois.
