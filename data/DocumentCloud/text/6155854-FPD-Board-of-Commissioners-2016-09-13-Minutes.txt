pleasure, and recreation of the public now and in the future; and

other alliance members to better protect nature, engage people, implement green infrastructure, and
communicate with a united voice the importance of protecting the natural and cultural heritage of this
region; and

and working groups. The District’s General Superintendent, Arnold Randall, has served as the Chair of
the Chicago Wilderness Executive Council since 2012; and
WHEREAS, the District looks forward to continuing its participation in the Chicago Wilderness alliance
to share expertise and leverage resources effectively for the benefit of all who call this regionhome; and

Summary: Camp Reinberg opened in June 2015 without approval by the Palatine Fire Department to
occupy the four (4) unheated cabins without year-round fire sprinkler protection, even though they would
be unoccupied during the winter. The cost to winterize the sprinkler system was significant, so the Forest
Preserves requested a waiver to leave the cabins unprotected last winter and explore the feasibility of
heating the cabins to allow for winter use. The cost to heat the cabins and meet the County and local
codes proved to be unfeasible, and additional time is needed to revert to the original plans to winterize the
sprinkler system only.

Summary: A contract extension is required to provide additional time to complete custom engraved
stone elements for outdoor interpretive areas. Prior to the July contract end date, Forest Preserve staff sent
notice of default to CCC for failing to complete work as specified, including the stone elements. The
Forest Preserves did not wish to extend the contract while default was pending. As a result of
discussions involving CCC’s surety, CCC committed to a plan and timeline for completing stone element
work under the contract. The contract period must be extended to allow for completion of work. Due to
long fabrication times for some stone elements, installation may not occur until next spring.

Summary: A contract extension is required to provide additional time to complete custom engraved
stone elements for outdoor interpretive areas. In June, Forest Preserve staff sent notice of default to CCC
for failing to complete work as specified, including the stone elements. As a result of discussions
involving CCC’s surety, CCC committed to a plan and timeline for completing stone element work under
the contract. The contract period must be extended to allow for completion of work. Due to long
fabrication times for some stone elements, installation may not occur until next spring.
