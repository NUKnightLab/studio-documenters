RESOLUTION TO AMEND RESOLUTION NO. 2014-CHA-5 AND
THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
WHEREAS,

the Chicago Housing Authority (the “Authority”) has been created by, and
exists under, the Housing Authorities Act, 310 ILCS 10/1 et seq., as amended
(the “Act”); and

WHEREAS,

pursuant to the Act, the management and control of the Authority is vested in ten
commissioners (herein after referred to as the "Board of Commissioners" or the
“Board”); and

WHEREAS,

Section 8 of the Act provides that the Authority shall have “all the powers
necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions”
of the Act, 310 ILCS 10/8; and

WHEREAS,

Section 1 of the By-Laws of the Authority provides, inter alia, that:
The commissioners may by resolution make any delegation of discretionary
powers or ministerial duties, to be exercised in accordance with the standards,
limitations, and controls which shall be set up in such resolution and which shall
not be inconsistent with the “Act in Relation to Housing Authorities” to any
committee or committees of one or more chosen from among their number. Any
action taken in the name of the Authority by a person or persons to whom such
powers or duties have been delegated shall be the action of the Authority and
binding upon it, provided such action is pursuant to and within the scope of the
delegation resolution, and consistent with “An Act in Relation to Housing
Authorities”; and

WHEREAS,

the Board has determined that it is in the Authority's best interest to amend the
first sentence of Section 2 of Resolution No. 2014-CHA-5, which established an
Audit Committee and adopted the CHA's Audit Committee Charter and amend
the Audit Committee Charter both with respect to the number of members to be
appointed to the Audit Committee.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the recitals set forth above are incorporated in their entirety as if fully set forth in
this Section 1; and

 THAT

the Board hereby adopts this Resolution, which amends the "COMPOSITION OF
COMMITTEE AND SELECTION OF MEMBERS" section of the Audit Committee
Charter on page 2 by deleing the first sentence and restating it as follows:
"The audit committee shall consist of five (5) members,
including four (4) members of the Board of Commissioners and
one (1) outside member chosen from the general community, all
of whom must be independent of Chicago Housing Authority
operations",
and which amends Section 2 of Resolution No. 2014-CHA-5 by deleting the first
sentence of Section 2 of the Resolution and restating it as follows:
"In accordance with the Audit Committee Charter, which is
attached to this Resolution and hereby adopted by the Board of
Commissioners, there is hereby established an Audit Committee
which shall be comprised of five (5) members, including four (4)
members selected from the Board of Commissioners and one (1)
member selected from the general community (the "Audit
Committee", or "Committee"), all of whom must be
independent of Chicago Housing Authority operations."

THAT

the Board reaffirms the adoption of the Audit Committee Charter and the
establishment of the Audit Committee by Resolution No. 2014-CHA-5, as
hereby amended by this Resolution:

THAT

Effective date: This Resolution shall be in full force and effect after its passage as
provided by law, and any other resolutions or parts thereof in conflict herewith are
hereby repealed to the extent of such conflict.
