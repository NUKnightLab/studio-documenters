PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
JOSEPH MARIO MORENO, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION PROPOSING FINANCIAL AND IMPACT REPORTING
FOR ORGANIZATIONS FUNDED WHOLLY OR IN PART BY COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Cook County government is charged with presenting a balanced budget each fiscal year, as
mandated by the Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, the budget process and the budget itself should be transparent so as to allow for proper
scrutiny by the public, whose tax dollars help fund it; and
WHEREAS, a transparent budget allows the Cook County Board of Commissioners to also properly
scrutinize and adjust it if necessary, through the amendment process, to help identify and eliminate
wasteful spending, as well as improve efficiencies; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government has an approximately $3 billion budget and allocates portions of
it to fund independent organizations, either directly or through one of its various departments; and
WHEREAS, currently these allocations appear simply as a line item in the annual appropriation bill or
not at all if funded by a governmental department; and
WHEREAS, it is this government’s obligation to ensure that monies are spent judiciously by funding
programs that have the highest return on investment via cost savings to the County and benefits to its
citizens; and
WHEREAS, it is difficult, if not impossible, to properly analyze the value of the return on investment of
these various organizations from a line item budget entry; and
WHEREAS, in order to determine which programs are effective and financially sound and worthy of
continued funding, it is necessary to have a tool documenting its effectiveness and cost savings.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request that any organization funded wholly or in part by the government of Cook County directly
or via one of its departments present an annual financial and impact report to this Honorable Body, so as
to properly document the associated cost savings, economic impact and effectiveness of the County
funded programs provided by these organizations.

JOSEPH MARIO MORENO, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE SET ASIDE OF HOME FUNDS
FOR THE TOWN OF CICERO
WHEREAS, according to the 1990 U.S. Census, Cicero was reported to have 23,179 occupied housing
units with a population of 67,436; and
WHEREAS, over the next ten years, Cicero’s population increased to 85,616, but with an accompanying
drop in the number of occupied housing units to 23,115; and
WHEREAS, presently, Cicero’s population is estimated to be over 100,000, a forty percent increase from
1990 or 23,000 additional people living in the same number of housing units that were available in 1990;
and
WHEREAS, the age of Cicero’s housing units, over 95% were constructed prior to 1970, has led to a
large number of health and safety hazards, such as structural deficiencies in heating, plumbing, and
electrical systems as well as the fact that the majority of these homes contain lead paint; and
WHEREAS, the unfortunate result of these deficiencies is a large number of families in need of
rehabilitating their homes and a disproportionate number of Cicero children under the age of six being
effected by lead poisoning; and
WHEREAS, the need for housing rehabilitation in Cicero has outgrown it’s available financial resources,
with over three hundred families on a waiting list requesting funds to rehabilitate their homes; and
WHEREAS, during the last two years the town has used a portion of its CDBG allocation to fund an
Emergency Assistance Program, providing funds up to $4,999 to repair a hazardous condition requiring
immediate action to protect the health and safety of residents; and
WHEREAS, the town’s Home Repair Program will be reinstated this year with a cap of $4,999 to assist
homeowners who do not qualify for the Emergency Assistance Program; and
WHEREAS, this cap results from the requirement to provide Lead Abatement in any residential
rehabilitation project costing more than $5,000, and the lack of available local funding coupled with the
large number of units in need of rehabilitation; and
WHEREAS, the age of Cicero’s housing array, and the fact that many of the occupied housing units are
severely overcrowded, has had a negative impact on the safety and livability of these units; and

4584

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007
WHEREAS, complicating this significant problem is the fact that Cicero is a minority community, made
up of approximately 85% Hispanics, and nearly 20% of its residents have incomes at or below the poverty
level, greatly limiting their ability to afford needed housing repairs; and
WHEREAS, since 1991, the Town of Cicero has been an integral part of the Cook County Consortium
related to the HOME and American Dream Down Payment Initiative; and
WHEREAS, as part of the Consortium, Cicero contributes 11.1% of the total dollar amount received by
Cook County for these programs or about $650,000 to $700,000 annually; and
WHEREAS, although many communities in Cook County have benefited from these housing funds, the
Town of Cicero, with a need as great as any other community, has yet to receive any funding under these
programs, a potential loss of some $10 million; and
WHEREAS, Cicero is not able to keep up with the demand and need for housing rehabilitation, it is
calling upon the County of Cook to set aside $1.5 million in HOME funds annually to the Town of Cicero
over the next ten years, and $750 thousand thereafter; and
WHEREAS, Cicero intends to use these dollars to increase the number of Cicero residents in need of
housing rehabilitation to be able to do so.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request the Cook County Department of Planning and Development set aside HOME funds for the
Town of Cicero for the purpose of improving the housing conditions of its residents; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Honorable Body thanks the Town of Cicero for their
continuing contributions to these worthwhile causes and wholeheartedly encourages their efforts at
improving the safety and well being of its citizens.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
THE SUPPORT HOMEOWNERS OF COOK COUNTY ACT
WHEREAS, the foreclosure rate of homes in Cook County and across America is rapidly increasing; and
WHEREAS, the foreclosure rate for the United States has hit the highest rate since 1986 in the Third
Quarter, and subprime loans are the highest group of loans in foreclosure with 4.72% of the subprime
loans in foreclosure; and
WHEREAS, the rate of foreclosures in some Cook County neighborhoods has increased over 100% from
2006 according to a report from the National Training and Information Center; and
WHEREAS, the federal government is taking steps to encourage a freeze of current subprime interest
rates, but the freeze only applies to individuals who meet specific criteria with a current subprime loan,
and the relief is only for people who entered into a subprime loan between January 1, 2005 and July 31,
2007, are not currently delinquent on their loan, have less than 3% equity in their property, and could not
afford a higher interest rate; and
WHEREAS, the larger issue of fraudulent loans, and loans issued to people who can not repay loans “reset” at dramatically higher rates, is not addressed; and
WHEREAS, a bill has been introduced into Congress, the Stop Fraud Act, which specifically addresses
the issue of mortgage fraud and subprime loans:
1. Establishes guidelines and both criminal and civil penalties for mortgage professionals who
knowingly issue fraudulent loans.
2. Creates a free, searchable database for consumers to search mortgage professionals.
3. Sets specific guidelines for lenders to follow in informing people of the details of their
potential loan.
4. Provides $25 million dollars in funding for local agencies and organizations to provide
assistance to consumers or potential consumer or loans.
WHEREAS, the Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act of 2007 has also been
introduced to Congress, the bill will update the current bankruptcy law to help more people save their
home. The Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act of 2007, amends the current
Bankruptcy law to:
1. Allow modification to the debtor’s primary residence loan.
2. Waives counseling for debtor’s who foreclosure sale on their primary residence has been
scheduled.
3. Supports long-term mortgage restructuring that gives debtor’s a longer amount of time to
repay.
4. Provides extra protection of homeowners 55 and older.
WHEREAS, in addition to the “Stop Fraud Act” and the “Helping Families Save Their Homes in
Bankruptcy Act of 2007” the Cook County Board of Commissioners also encourages Congress to enact a
freeze on foreclosures for homeowners who have been victimized by misleading and fraudulent loans
from mortgage companies.

4586

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners supports
the passage of the “Stop Fraud Act” and the “Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act of
2007” by the United States Congress; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution be sent to each member of the Illinois
Congressional delegation.

address the issue of the constitutionality of the proposed substitute ordinances (Communication Nos.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007
Mr. Prinzi responded that based upon their review, it was believed that the Board’s authority to pass these
ordinances was well grounded under Home Rule authority established by the 1970 Constitution, and
under the Counties Code. He added that a position had been prepared by the Office of the State’s
Attorney in writing, and that he would get back to Commissioner Peraica on that point.
Commissioner Beavers, seconded by Vice Chairman Sims, moved that the Substitute Ordinance
(Communication No. 289098) be approved and adopted. Commissioner Peraica called for a Roll
Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

Commissioner Maldonado moved the approval of the Proposed Ordinance (Communication No.
290563). The motion died for lack of a second.
A lengthy discussion ensued related to the ongoing Fiscal Year 2008 Budget deliberations.
Chairman Daley noted that there had been an interest expressed by members to bring in the elected
officials of Cook County and bureau chiefs/department heads under the President to further review the
proposed budget recommendations for their departments. He indicated that if it was the will of the
Committee to do so, he would call a meeting for such purpose.
After the members were provided with a report which listed Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007 appropriations
by department, highlighting the percent change from year to year, Commissioner Gorman requested a
more detailed breakdown of the reductions made by Commissioners to their individual office budgets;
Commissioner Schneider requested a more detailed breakdown of reductions made by business unit.
Jarese Wilson, Director of the Department of Budget and Management Services, responded that she
would provide the information to the Committee.
Recognizing the lack of new revenue, Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Goslin,
moved to direct all separately elected officials and bureaus and agencies under the President to
prepare and submit a 10% budget reduction contingency plan, exempting the Sheriff’s Department
of Corrections and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, and reducing the plan to 3% for the
Treasurer’s Office and 5% for the Recorder of Deeds’ Office. Each separately elected official and
office shall also submit revenue enhancement plans to increase revenues and such plans shall be
credited towards the individual office’s proposed reduction. The plans shall be submitted to the
Director of the Department of Budget and Management Services and the Office of the Chief
Financial Officer on or before Monday, December 17, 2007.
Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to amend the main motion to
exempt the Bureau of Health Services from submitting a 10% budget reduction contingency plan.
The motion to amend carried unanimously.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007
Having voted on the prevailing side, Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Claypool,
moved to reconsider the vote by which the amendment to exempt the Bureau of Health Services
from submitting a 10% budget reduction contingency plan was approved. The motion to
reconsider carried. Vice Chairman Sims and Commissioners Beavers, Butler and Maldonado
voted no.
Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to amend the main motion by
removing all exemptions. Commissioner Gorman called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays
being as follows:

separately elected officials and bureaus and agencies under the President to prepare and submit a
10% budget reduction contingency plan, exempting the Sheriff’s Department of Corrections and
the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, and reducing the plan to 3% for the Treasurer’s Office
and 5% for the Recorder of Deeds’ Office. Each separately elected official and office shall also

SHERIFF OF COOK COUNTY, Thomas J. Dart, by David S. Devane, Executive Director,
Department of Community Supervision and Intervention:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for twelve (12) months, Contract
No. 05-73-561 with HEALTHCARE ALTERNATIVE SERVICES, INC. (HAS),
Chicago, Illinois, for a substance abuse treatment program for the Sheriff’s Department of
Community Supervision and Intervention, Day Reporting Center.
Reason:

The Sheriff’s Office is exercising a one-year extension option as per contract
documents. Healthcare Alternative Systems, Inc. (HAS) has seven (7) staff
serving the population of the Day Reporting Program. Most of the staff are
Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselors who provide classroom-size counseling
or cognitive instruction focused on substance abuse education and treatment,
relapse prevention, drug dependency education, and cognitive-behavioral
restructuring. HAS staff also provided limited individual counseling, case
management, community referrals for ancillary services, and on-site drug testing.
The expiration date of the current contract is January 8, 2008.

COOK COUNTY ASSESSOR, James M. Houlihan, by John M. Fallon, Special Assistant to
the Assessor, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ACS
GOVERNMENT RECORDS MANAGEMENT, Dallas, Texas, for enhancements to the
Recorder of Deeds indexing module of the 20/20 Perfect Vision System and two (2) years of
maintenance and technical support for the Assessor’s Scanning and Document Imaging
System. These enhancements will give the Recorder of Deeds the ability to capture the
additional data from the IL PTAX-203 Transfer Declaration Form. This data is currently
being captured by the Assessor’s Office and is needed to support the Illinois Department of
Revenue’s Sales Ration Study and the Assessor’s Office Assessment Cycle. The
enhancements to the Recorder’s 20/20 System will eliminate the duplicative data entry efforts
being made by the Recorder of Deeds and the Assessor’s Office, and give the Recorder of
Deeds the ability to capture all of the data needed by the agencies.
Reason:

ACS Government Records Management (ACS) is the original vendor for the
Recorder of Deeds 20/20 Perfect Vision System and the Assessor’s Scanning and
Document Imaging System. The Recorder of Deeds and the Assessor’s Office
Imaging Systems contain ACS proprietary software or software customized
exclusively by ACS to meet business needs. To have another vendor undertake
these enhancements and have them enter our environments to learn our systems
and business processes would be very costly and timely. ACS fully understands
the Recorder of Deeds and Assessor’s Office Imaging Systems and the related
business functions that will be implemented, making this the best way to achieve
our goals in a cost efficient manner.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $61,500.00. Contract period: December 1, 2007 through
November 30, 2009. (040-441 Account). Requisition No. 70400037.

ACCURATE POSITION TITLES AND SALARY GRADES REPORT (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Deborah Sims, County
Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ACCURATE POSITION TITLES AND SALARY GRADES REPORT
WHEREAS, Cook County government is in a challenging budget year and is working on
passing a balanced fiscal year 2008 budget by finding an appropriate balance between cutting
expenses and generating additional revenues; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government is making concentrated efforts to cut expenses by
streamlining operations through the elimination of duplicity in various government
departments through consolidation, increasing revenue collection efforts and improving
efficiencies; and
WHEREAS, it is nearly impossible for the Board of Commissioners to make thoughtful
decisions as to whether various positions are necessary to the operation and core missions of
County departments, when many budget titles and salary grades contained in the County
budget do not accurately describe the work being performed by people in those budgeted
positions; and
WHEREAS, arbitrarily cutting positions is neither conducive to providing core services for
which this government is responsible and upon which our citizens rely, nor to streamlining
operations to run effectively and efficiently; and
WHEREAS, there is a long history of not updating position titles in the County budget as
those positions and the duties of people in those budgeted positions have evolved over the
years; and
WHEREAS, it is the desire of this Honorable Body to receive the most accurate information
available to make the necessary changes and decisions to ensure this government will be
financially viable and responsible to the taxpayers it represents and efficiently provide the
services for which it is mandated; and
WHEREAS, having the necessary information to make informed decisions on where to make
cuts if necessary, is essential to running an effective organization.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby request that the Bureau of Human Resources provide the County Board, no later
than September 1, 2008, with a list of all positions in the County, by department, which show
position titles and salary grades that accurately reflect the work being performed by people in
those positions; and

4673

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007

REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON HOSPITAL GOVERNANCE

The Board of Commissioners of Cook County

Chairman Goslin and Vice Chairman Murphy, Commissioners Butler, Collins, Daley,
Moreno and Silvestri (7)

Also Present:

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Task Force on Hospital Governance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Tuesday, December 11, 2007 at the hour of 9:15 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
The purpose of the meeting was to take testimony from various representatives of the Civic Federation,
the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council and the National Public Hospital Association.
Chairman Goslin called the meeting to order, and called upon Mr. Kevin Scanlan, President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council.

4703

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007
Mr. Scanlan testified on behalf of the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council, which is an organization
representing one hundred forty hospitals and healthcare organizations in the metropolitan Chicagoland
area. He stated that Oak Forest, Provident and Stroger Hospitals of Cook County have been members for
decades and have utilized member services provided by the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council
such as unemployment compensation administration, group purchasing, compensation surveys and
revenue cycle consulting.
Mr. Scanlan stated that the Bureau of Health Services has a critical role in the regional health care safety
net. The financial viability of all hospitals and the regional health care safety net continues to be
challenged through increasing numbers of uninsured; significant and ongoing under-funding from the
state and federal government for the Medicaid and Medicare programs; coupled with an aging population
and demands for enhanced technology. Approximately seventy percent of the more than fifty private
hospitals located in Cook County report negative care margins. These same hospitals provided $2.3
billion in annual charitable care, which includes $1.6 billion in free care. When combined with the
Bureau of Health Services’ Fiscal Year 2007 budget, all hospitals in Cook County provided more than $3
billion in free care and other charitable care services.
On the issue of governance, Mr. Scanlan stated that while the Board is contemplating future governance
structures, the focus should be on the future of the Bureau of Health Services. He did not indicate
preference to any particular governance structure; he believed that the Bureau of Health Services’
governance decisions should be considered and made by the Board of Commissioners.
Chairman Goslin asked Mr. Scanlan how the patient load would be absorbed if the Bureau of Health
Services were to be dissolved or services provided were to be significantly reduced.
Mr. Scanlan replied that they could not be absorbed, and the result might mean the closure of other
institutions.
Chairman Goslin asked Mr. Scanlan for information on the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council
members’ percentage of “self-pay” patients by institution.
Mr. Scanlan responded that he would supply the information to him.
Commissioner Daley asked Mr. Scanlan for a breakdown of the $3 billion in annual charitable care.
Mr. Scanlan responded that he could provide Commissioner Daley with a breakdown of the $2.3 billion
in charitable care provided by the more than fifty private hospitals.
Commissioner Daley stated that some suggestions had been made to resolve the Bureau of Health
Services’ financial position. These suggestions include the closure of Provident Hospital of Cook County
and the removal of tax exempt status for some private hospitals who are not providing a certain amount of
charitable care. He asked Mr. Scanlan what would be the impact of such measures.
Mr. Scanlan replied that the closure of Provident Hospital of Cook County would have patients turning to
local hospitals. Taking away tax exempt status from the private hospitals would put some of these
institutions at the brink of closure. There would be significant cuts in services and it would increase the
patient load at Stroger Hospital of Cook County.

4704

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007
Chairman Goslin called upon the next public speaker.
Ms. Lise Valentine, Vice President and Director of Research of the Civic Federation read into the record a
statement provided by Mr. Lawrence Msall, President of the Civic Federation. (The referenced
documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Daley stated that a truly independent board needs taxing authority and needs to be totally
separate from the Board of Commissioners. He believed that if the Board chose to implement a
temporary independent governing structure, the Board would continue to approve the budget until such
time a permanent independent governing structure with taxing authority was functioning. In order to
effect such change in Springfield, a collective effort from the elected officials and community leaders
must be made.
Commissioner Butler was concerned with the perceived lack of understanding of the mission of the
Bureau of Health Services. He believed that the Bureau of Health Services was never given adequate
funds and questioned how the Board would pay the costs associated with independent governance.
Commissioner Silvestri opined that if the Board of Commissioners has to approve a budget for an
independent governance board, then it is not truly independent. He believed that an interim period for
independent governance should be ten years; interim periods of one or three years are too short to achieve
meaningful successes.
Chairman Goslin called upon the next public speaker.
The next speaker was Reverend Alexander Sharp, Executive Director of Protestants for the Common
Good, and Vice Chairman of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability. He spoke in support of an
interim independent governing board, and if possible, a permanent independent governing board. He
referenced portions of the Goodman Report and challenged that the Bureau’s revenue uncollectables were
overstated in the report. He believed that they were in the range of $40 million to $140 million, not $200
million.
Commissioner Daley remarked that the County Commissioners have received audit reports every year
that detail problems at the institutions under the Bureau of Health Services. He added that the Bureau of
Health Services has improved in recent times, pointing out that the rejection rate for Medicaid eligibility
intake forms has decreased from 76% to 15%. Furthermore, he stated that the Goodman Report
recommended hiring one hundred forty-four people for finance related matters and seventy people to
work on information technology matters.
Commissioner Silvestri reminded the Task Force members that a recent bill to shift $100 million in
subsidies to the Cook County Bureau of Health Services failed to pass in Springfield.
Commissioner Collins stated that a coalition should be organized to lobby in Springfield. Additionally,
she questioned why Cook County is the only county in Illinois that recognizes their responsibility for
providing healthcare to their indigent.
Commissioner Sims stated her opposition to independent governance. She envisioned irreconcilable
conflict over budgetary matters between an independent governance board and the Board of
Commissioners. She believed that the Board should instead give the President the same amount of time
proposed for the temporary trusteeship to turn around the Bureau’s financial position. A national search
should be conducted to find an expert to run the hospitals under the current governance structure.

4705

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007
Commissioner Maldonado stated that he agreed with Commissioner Sims in principle, as he was opposed
to privatization of the Bureau of Health Services. He was also concerned that there may be transparency
issues related to adding another layer of government through an independent governance board. The
temporary trusteeship is the only option at this time that he supports.
Chairman Goslin called upon the next public speaker.
Quentin Young, M.D., Chairman of the Health and Medicine Policy Research Group, spoke on behalf of
the establishment of a temporary trusteeship. He believes that it is impossible to solve the Bureau of
Health Services’ financial problems without new taxes.
Commissioner Daley pointed out that a temporary trusteeship would still need to come to the Board for
revenue.
Chairman Goslin called upon the next public speaker.
Lynne Johnson, Director of the Chicago Foundation for Women, spoke in favor of a temporary
trusteeship and submitted a statement from Mary Morten, Acting Executive Director of the Chicago
Foundation for Women. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Goslin called upon the next public speaker.
George Blakemore, a concerned citizen, spoke in favor of an interim trusteeship.
Commissioner Moreno asked Robert R. Simon, M.D., Interim Chief of the Bureau of Health Services,
whether an independent board would solve the Bureau of Health Services’ revenue problems.
Dr. Simon responded that it would not; most institutions across the country are experiencing huge
financial problems regardless of the type of governance. As he had mentioned at the meeting of the Task
Force on Hospital Governance on November 13, 2007, Dr. Simon again recommended that the Board of
Commissioners bring in Larry Gage, President of the National Association of Public Hospitals. Mr. Gage
has helped a number of other boards develop independent governance boards and has indicated his
willingness to assist the County.
Chairman Goslin responded that efforts to have Mr. Gage attend a Task Force meeting had been
unsuccessful due to scheduling problems.
Dr. Simon responded that he would assist in the efforts to engage the assistance of Mr. Gage.
Dr. Simon requested to clarify an earlier statement regarding loss of employees. He stated that the
Bureau had 1,049 employees in the entire clinic system in 2002. However, in 2007 there was a total
number of 552 employees in the entire clinic system. The clinic system cannot function at that level; for
Fiscal Year 2008 a request was made for 425 new positions.
At the request of Chairman Goslin, Dr. Simon addressed remarks made by Commissioner Peraica with
regard to clinic closures that occurred in 2007 and the subsequent effects of such closures. It was alleged
that emergency room visits increased as a result of the clinic closures.
Dr. Simon replied that the statement was inaccurate. There was no increase at the Bureau of Health
Services’ emergency rooms; he verified that the surrounding hospitals experienced minimal increases in
emergency room visits.

4706

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2007
Commissioner Schneider indicated that he was in favor of an independent governing board. However, he
questioned who would ultimately provide financial oversight over an independent governing board with
taxing authority.
Chairman Goslin stated that the intent was to retain financial oversight by the Board of Commissioners.
He added that any transfer to an independent governing board would have strings attached, allowing for
ultimate oversight by the Board of Commissioners.
Commissioner Butler cited an article in Healthcare IT News, which ranked Stroger Hospital of Cook
County number one in the category of “Major Teaching Hospitals” in completeness and accuracy of their
medical coding practices used to bill Medicare for inpatient medical services.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to adjourn. The motion carried
and the meeting was adjourned.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY
AGREEMENT AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 20, 2007 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
Transmitted herewith is a request for your approval of an Amended Settlement Agreement and Mutual
Release between the County of Cook and XL Specialty Insurance Company. Provisions in this agreement
will provide for the completion of Contract No. 03-53-868. It is respectfully requested that this
Honorable Body approve this request.
The Cook County Board of Commissioners approved a public improvement contract with UBM, Inc. on
December 16, 2003 for the Hektoen Building Renovation Project - Phase 2A. XL Specialty Insurance
Company was the Surety for the contract providing performance Bond No. SB0087401. Before
completing the contract, UBM, Inc. defaulted and the County demanded performance from XL Specialty
Insurance Company under the Bond. A settlement was reached with this Surety Company to bring closure
to this project.
On July 31, the County Board approved a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release. As part of the
Settlement Agreement, XL agreed to perform all of the remaining “disputed” work on the punch list, and
the County agreed not to seek liquidated damages. Of the $646,658.27 that remains in the Contract, the
parties agreed that the County was entitled to a credit of $320,000 for the work it performed. That left
$326,658.27 in the Contract, which, under the Settlement Agreement, would be deposited with the Clerk
of the Circuit Court, pursuant to a court order, one half of which would not be released to XL until Capital
Planning has approved the “disputed” work and the extended warranty (attached to the Settlement
Agreement) began to run.
Because of XL’s delays in performing the work agreed upon in the Settlement Agreement, Capital
Planning took it upon itself to accomplish some of the work and to acquire a warranty agreement that
included the work under the Contract. Therefore, the terms of the Settlement Agreement are no longer
viable.
In the copy of the Amended Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (“Amended Settlement
Agreement”), XL has agreed to complete the remaining work on the Contract within the time-frame set
forth in the Amended Settlement Agreement. XL has also agreed that it is now entitled to only
$173,767.22 from the Contract funds (as opposed to $326,658.27 under the terms of the original
Settlement Agreement).
Fiscal Impact: None.
Approval of this settlement agreement is recommended by the State’s Attorney’s Office and the Office of
Capital Planning & Policy.

$9,901,507.00

Infusion pump models for two (2) of the major suppliers of infusion pumps and infusion
pump disposables (Baxter and Alaris) have several alerts and recalls respectively in past for
their products. As a result, an attempt by Cook County to solicit a bid for infusion pump
administration sets with new pumps in this reduced competitive environment would certainly
result in increased costs. The expiration date of the current contract is December 31, 2007.
The Cook County Bureau of Health Services estimates that the extension of this contract with
the existing infusion pumps provided by the vendor will result in cost savings of $914,486.00
(24%) to Cook County for this two-year extension.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,329,710.00 ($1,664,855.00 per year) [$19,272.00 ($9,636.00 per year) (240-362 Account); $707,932.00 ($353,966.00 per year) - (891-362 Account); $2,296,548.00

Account)]. Contract extension: January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 and future year funds.
