RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
February 14th was “Ohio Loves Transit” Day. AMATS Executive Director Curtis Baker, Valerie
Shea and I, along with other transit systems from across the state, gathered in Columbus to meet
with our representatives to talk about the need for a dedicated state funding source for public
transportation. Did you know that Ohio ranks 47th in the nation for providing public transportation
funding in our communities? We’re behind Pennsylvania and Michigan, and even worse, we’re
behind states like Alaska and Utah. Representatives Galonski and Weinstein pledged their
support, and Leader Emilia Sykes spoke passionately about the need for a level playing field
when it comes to public transit and the mobility solutions we provide. Our ridership is slowly
climbing, and the need for our service will continue to grow. Together we must show a strong
commitment to raising the bar on public transportation investments in Ohio.
Yours in accessible transportation,
Dawn Distler
Executive Director

 JANUARY 2019 OPERATIONS REPORT
The following Operator was recognized for 20 Years of Safe Driving: Betsy Blazsik
The training hours for the month of January 2019 totaled 1,234. The training consisted of New Hire Training,
Refresher Training, Line-Service training, Specialty Training and mandatory training per the Preventable Accident
Policy.
The Winter Sign-Up was conducted January 7-9, 2019. Operators had the opportunity to select their routes based on
seniority for the following ten weeks. A special Sign-Up was conducted January 10-14, 2019 for Operators who were
required to work on Monday, January 21, 2019 (Martin Luther King Jr. Day).
The Operation’s Department held its Quarterly Staff Meeting on Sunday, January 27, 2019.
METRO provided complimentary service from various Warming Stations throughout the City of Akron to Mason
Community Learning Center. This service was provided as a courtesy from Tuesday, January 29 through Friday,
February 1, 2019. The purpose was to aid individuals who may have been without heat or shelter during the
inclement weather.
METRO also provided complimentary service to all Federal employees from January 22 through February 15, to aid
individuals who may have been under a financial hardship due to the partial government shutdown.
JANUARY 2019 CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PARATRANSIT REPORT
PARATRANSIT PASSENGERS – 20,327 passengers transported in January 2019
While in the grip of an arctic blast, even with free fare, we had many cancellations amongst our paratransit population
throughout the last week of the month. Even with lower than normal trip counts in the last week, we ended the
month serving 20,327 passengers over 21.5 weekdays and eight weekends. We remain steady, looking at trip counts
from Januarys in 2012 through 2019; with a high of 22,877 passengers transported in 2012 and a low of 18,651
passengers transported in 2014. Our service miles increased this month, as the overall average per trip increased, due
to Cleveland Clinic policy changes and sending patients to outlying satellite offices for appointments.
NON EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION (NET) – DEPARTMENT OF JOB AND FAMILY SERVICES (DJFS):
We transported 2,283 passengers under the DJFS NET program to medical appointments in January. We have
experienced a severe decline in trips over the last several months, as has one of the other three providers. We
continue to work closely with DJFS personnel to ensure all clients are provided with transportation for their medical
needs under Medicaid.
TRAINING, MOBILITY, ELIGIBILTY AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT:
Twenty-two people came in for mobility device assessments, internal functional assessments, and outreach to
community events. 64 courtesy calls were made to new clients and 152 applications were processed, including 13
new Reduced Fare applicants.
As a group, Customer Service attended meetings, gave presentations or worked at several events in the community in
January, including: community activist, Stephanie Leonardi, Department of Jobs & Family Services/NET Medicaid
transportation; International Institute Group Training; NOGC; NET call with SARTA; Ohio Means Jobs Center; Mayor
Horrigan’s Senior Commission; Fowler Apartments; ADA Training for new SSO Operators; Akron Blind Center; Project
Search; Kenmore Community Center; Patterson Community Center; Summa Western Reserve Functional Assessments;
ASCA Pathways HUB Staff Training; Infant Vitality Strategic Planning Retreat #3; Ontario Apartments; Easter Seals
Transportation Bootcamp; Direction Home Annual Meeting; ASCA HeadStart; and the Akron Recreation Bureau’s
Active Adults Staff Training.

 February 2019 Update
 10 Paratransit Buses are currently in production in Canton, Michigan – pictured below. The
buses will start arriving in three weeks and are expected to be in service in April.
 January proved to be a challenging month for the METRO fleet with the on-set of the polar
vortex; as a result we finished the month with 23 road calls more than our average.

burden they may have had during the shutdown.
Ms. Distler recognized Operators Amanda Jones and Sandra Guess, and Sergeant Robert Horvath
for the roles they played in bringing a child out of harm’s way on a busy street. A video was

8

 shown of the event as seen from METRO bus surveillance cameras, and it highlighted the quick
actions taken to protect the child and return her to her mother. All those involved were applauded

February. Ms. Shea expressed her appreciation for Mr. Buie’s fine service with METRO.

most outstanding mid-sized transit centers in the country.
Mr. DeJournett reminded everyone that the Board Retreat would be held Monday, February 25th
in the Greystone building where the Downtown Akron Partnership’s offices are located. He
hoped that a better strategy could be developed going forward for things like the structure of the
Board Committees, both in their meeting times, and the selection of chairs. He indicated that the
Board would meet at RKPTC and ride to the Greystone, and that it would be good if the Board
members would make a habit of riding a METRO bus periodically and reporting back of their
experience.
