the strict application of the following sections of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances:

not permitted in a Local Retail Business District but first permitted in a General Retail Business
District.

is nonconforming in required landscaping, a determination by the Board of Zoning Appeals is
required to maintain the landscaping non-conformity. Property is non-conforming in that a six
foot wide landscaped frontage strip is required separating parking lot from street. Some
frontage landscaping of less than six feet with no plantings is proposed. (Filed March 25,
