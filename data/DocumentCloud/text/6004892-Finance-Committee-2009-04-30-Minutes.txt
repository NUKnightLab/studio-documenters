Operating Revenue

Fees at the end of Febmary collected from patient services were below
budget year to date by $5,077,365 or 7. The largest source of

year to date by 347, 411 or 4. -

expense. Bene?ts for employees are below the budget because salaries

to date. The System is using the accrual convention to measure supply
expense based on the budgeted expenditures minus any documented
