HACP JULY 26, 2018 MEETING MINUTES

1

 1. Rich Johnston - Allegheny Dwellings, who owns a home across from Allegheny Dwellings, asked
for a meeting with Mr. Binion. He stated that he spoke to Yasmin Shaheed numerous times. Mr.
Binion set up a meeting for August 1, 2019. After the meeting Amy Shaffer will contact Ms.
Johnston to set a time regarding repairing the bullet holes in his house.
2. Joanne Mosley - is a neighbor of Rich Johnston and speaking to the board to support Mr. Johnston.
Re: negligent landlord; responsible property managers for Allegheny Dwellings.
3. Ronell Guy - Member of the Landless Peoples Alliance and Tenant Union. She proclamied that
HACP should not follow national policy. HACP needs to stop demolishing buildings/units; creating
a moratorium on demolition and find efficient and effective means to managing public housing. The
private/public partnerships are not working.
4. Lisa Gonzalez – She asked for a moratorium on the issuing of Section 8 vouchers to give people,
currently on the program, more time to find a Section 8 acceptable unit.
5. Adrian Crummell – She said she was in “h.e.l.l.” and that KBK not in compliance at Larimer Pointe.
She asked who protects tenant? HACP needs to mediate between landlords and tenants. Is there a
self-sufficiency program at Larimer Point – such as the escrow program?
Her PBV counselor has not had her account right in 3 years. She paid $2,000.00 to KBK and
shouldn’t have (as she is a zero renter). How does she get her money back? She went to
Washington, D.C. to express her frustration.
6. Randall Taylor said there has to be a new way of doing things and dealing with low income folks
with housing issues. Mr. Taylor also advocated for the stoppage of destruction of NVH and Bedford
Dwellings.
7. Steve Capri – Affordable housing in Pittsburgh is at a very low point and that instead of demolishing
existing properties, HACP should look into renovating the properties instead or find some other
solution besides demolition for example, he said, Penn Plaza. Peter Kaplan spoke up and said that
Penn Plaza was not HACP’s project.
8. Sherman Hopson – Bedford – spoke about Choice Neighborhoods is going to push folks to the
suburbs and they will have to choose between utilities and food. AMI is constantly going up and
something needs to be done. Also when is Bedford going to have a proper council? The aborigines
were also tenants kicked out for they are the indigenous population.
9. Craig Stevens – North Point Breeze – Landless Peoples Alliance and Tenant Union. There should
be more low income/mixed income communities. Nothing should be demolished and asked that
Rev. Burgess support a true mixed-income community.
10. Carmen Brown – last of public comments. Ms. Brown said she was there to support everything
everyone said about the tearing down of properties and that we should stop demolition.
There were no more public comments.
