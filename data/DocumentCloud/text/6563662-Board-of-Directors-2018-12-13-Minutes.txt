MARITIME COMMITTEE
A gentle Item 4 (B) (2) Operating A greemem? for Logistec USA Inc.

Mr. Gutheil addressed the Board and introduced Mr. Rodney Corrigan and Mr. Tripp Bailey from
Logistec. He then referred to a presentation attached hereto as ?Exhibit Mr. Gutheil thanked
FMT and edNav for their service to the Port. FMT has been the sole terminal operator to the Port
since 1997 and the relationship has been good. When looking forward to where we?d like to see
the Port in the future, this change is important for the ?Jture success of the Port and for the
diversi?cation of cargo. The Port of Cleveland would like to continue to serve the FedNav vessels
in the future.

Mr. Friedman invited Mr. Rodney Corrigan to address the Board. Mr. Corrigan stated that
Logistec has been working with the port for 2 years and operates in 37 ports and has 61 terminals
in the US. and Canada. He noted that there is much synergy with Logistec?s skill set and the
Port?s needs. It matches up quite nicely and they are excited about the opportunity. Mr. Friedman
noted that Logistec is an independent terminal operator and their bread and butter is marketing and
finding cargo and generating more cargo. This is different from FMT being a small part ofa vessel
operating company and the goals aren?t always aligned with the Port. The Port is focused on
diversifying cargo while keeping our existing customers. Mr. Gutheil stated that there is a specific
noti?cation process that will be implemented with the Port?s current customers. Face?to-face
meetings will be scheduled with each customer. Director Ronayne asked whether there would be
timely access to information from the Logistec staff. Mr. Gutheil replied yes. Director Applegate
stated that FMT is the employer of the International Longshoreman on the Port?s docks and asked
whether Logistec would now become the employer. Mr. Gutheil stated yes, that Logistec will
become a signatory to the current contract. Mr. Friedman stated that many discussions have taken
place and Logistec is committed to the workforce at the Port. Director Applegate asked if Logistec
works with the at other ports. Mr. Corrigan replied yes, and that he looks forward to a
seamless transition. Mr. Gutheil stated that the workforce on the docks has been injury free for
almost two years which is a testament to the ILA and how safely they operate. We expect that this
will continue with Lo gistec as the operator. Director Roller asked whether there is any concern of
FedNav ships avoiding Cleveland. Mr. Gutheil stated that it?s always a risk when making a
change. The Port and Logistec will do everything possible to maintain the relationships with
FedNav and FMT. It?s important to note that Logistec has a very good relationship with FedNav
as well and operates their ships in various ports. The Port will tell FedNav that the decision to
change operators was based on a terminal operating standpoint, not based upon who is moving the
cargo. This is an extremely important distinction and it is our hope that they will see it that way
also. Director Roller asked whether the customer or the shipper decides what Port?s they call. Mr.
Gutheil said it?s based upon contracts. Director Applegate asked whether there is a record of
relationships with Logistec and FedNav in other ports. Mr. Corrigan replied that Logistec took
over business in a Montreal port, and the transition occurred seamlessly. Logistec works
with FedNav in four ports in Ontario and also the three Rivers Port as well as other ports.

Mr. Carl Naso addressed the Board of Directors and referred to pages 21?22 of the Agenda.

management system. Mr. Naso added that the Port can only recover 25% of capital costs related
to the CDF. Director Applegate asked about the purpose of the $200,000 grant. Mr. Naso replied
