Originally, the department appropriated funds for professional services to assist in real estate transfer tax

early in the year as our auditors assisted in finalizing our ITPS design and requirements for Release 2. Our
Salary/Wages have an unanticipated surplus due to terminations and higher than expected turnover
experienced this year.

Summary: The Alsip Mini Mill manufacturing facility’s use of HUD Section 108 funds will assist in the
generation of approximately $70 million in private capital investment and the creation of 85 jobs related to
the acquisition and conversion of a formerly shuttered paper mill facility that has been closed since 2014
due to economic reasons as the coated paper industry has been on a decline for several years due to
consumers moving from print to electronic media consumption. The closure has negatively impacted local
community residents and commerce in the Village of Alsip and the surrounding area in southern Cook
County. Thus, the HUD Section 108 loan program will serve as a key economic development tool within
Cook County economic development portfolio to support projects such as Alsip Mini Mill to significantly
grow jobs at a faster rate for residents in the southern suburbs of the County.

Accounts: Not applicable
Concurrences:
Budget and Management Services has received all requisite documents, and determined the fiscal impact

on Cook County, if any.
Summary:

The Cook County North Suburban Municipal Districts Drug Court Service Enhancement

Program builds upon the court’s capacity to help program participants: assessing needs, offering practical
recovery supports, reducing financial and access barriers to treatment through integration of clinical case
management with health literacy and health insurance assistance, and strengthening client outcomes
through

targeted

evidence-based

medication-assisted

and

residential

treatment

services.

Enhancement

programs were implemented last year in three suburban drug treatment courts in Cook County: the Fourth
Municipal

District

(Maywood),

Fifth

Municipal

District

(Bridgeview),

and

Sixth

Municipal

District

(Markham). This program expands enhancements to the Second Municipal District (Skokie) and the Third
Municipal District (Rolling Meadows). All five of the suburban Cook County drug courts are now
supported by Federal SAMHSA program grants.
The purpose of the program is to increase the number of suburban drug court participants who graduate
successfully and achieve stable recovery and affect the long-term health and safety needs of these
individuals and their communities. Participants in the program will include adult men and women (age 18
and older) who are arrested/charged with new non-violent, drug-related felony offenses and are diagnosed
with substance use disorders.
Project funds are dedicated mostly for community-based case management and treatment services. The
remainder is used for staff, fringe benefits, supplies, training and travel.
