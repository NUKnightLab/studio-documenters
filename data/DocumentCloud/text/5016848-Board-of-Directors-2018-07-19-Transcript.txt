MS. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. President.

22

The tragic death of Mr. Agustus last Saturday

23

in South Shore has raised many legitimate

24

questions.

And as the lead investigative body

 Report of Proceedings - July 19, 2018

in all fatal shootings by members of the

Chicago Police Department, the Civilian Office

3

of Police Accountability recognizes and

4

acknowledges the public's interest to know all

5

the circumstances that led to the death of

6

Mr. Agustus.

7

First and foremost, I again send

8

my condolences to the family of Mr. Agustus.

9

And would like to say that this is an open and

10

ongoing investigation.

of this investigation.

22

Many unanswered questions

Many facts are still unknown,

I appreciate and empathize with
the community's desire for more information.
And as the Chief Administrator,

23

it is my duty to balance that need against the

24

duty to ensure that actions are not taken that
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 Report of Proceedings - July 19, 2018

1

may compromise the integrity of this

2

investigation.

3

Publicly, on numerous occasions,

4

we have stated that protecting the integrity of

5

our investigation is paramount and must never

6

be compromised.

7

To that end, COPA must ensure

8

that witnesses, civilian or sworn, do not

9

intentionally or otherwise comport their

10

interview statement to what they observed on

11

video rather than their independent

12

recollection.

13

Further audio and video released

14

prior to the interview of key witnesses creates

15

substantial risk to the integrity of this

16

investigation.

17

COPA is committed to

18

investigating this incident and all matters

19

under its jurisdiction in a fair, competent and

20

thorough manner, independent of outside

21

influence, bias or prejudice.

22

COPA is equally committed to

23

transparency.

To that end, we will release all

24

video, audio, and 911 communications at the

earliest point, while still preserving the

integrity of the investigation, on no later

3

than September 12th, 2018, which is 60 days

4

from the date of the incident as reflected in

5

the City's transparency policy.

6

In addition, in accordance with

7

the municipal ordinance, we will publicly post

8

on our website a summary of this investigation.

9

I note, given the history of

10

police oversight in Chicago, asking for your

11

patience and trust is a lot to ask, but as the

12

new Chief Administrator, I am asking just that.

13

The recently released video has

14

not caused COPA to reach a conclusion in this

15

case.

16

A substantive investigation is

17

currently underway, and COPA will reach its

18

findings based on the facts of that

19

investigation without influence or interference

20

by any individual or institution.

21

I ask that COPA, given the

22

opportunity to do what we have been tasked to

23

do, and that anyone with information in this

24

case to contact our office at 312-716-3609.

 Report of Proceedings - July 19, 2018

1

problem, and it starts at the top with that

2

culture.

3

So let me quickly hit four items.

4

With Mr. Agustus, my concern is, Superintendent

5

Johnson, you released that tape because you

6

wanted to show him with a gun, and you feel

7

that that's a justified shooting.

8

you released the tape.

9

community asked for, but if that tape had in

That's why

I understand what the

10

any way been to the detriment of any of those

11

officers, in your opinion, you wouldn't have

12

released it.

13

So my concern is, this

14

investigation, they're going to find that

15

shooting justified.

16

my time with that.

17

So I'm not going to waste

But let me tell you, I looked at

18

that tape 20 times.

The initial tape, the

19

first five, six seconds, Mr. Agustus, he was

20

engaged with the officer.

21

media and everybody to look at that.

22

23

3

the other two officers, specifically the female

5

reach for his gun.

Now, it sent a very bad message.

When you start meeting with -- behind closed

doors with so-called community leaders, one of

19

them Jedidiah Brown, and I come to these

20

meetings fairly often, I have never seen him at

21

this address in a Police Board meeting, but

22

that's who they had before the cameras.

leaders -- I don't know how you get your

I'd like disclosure on what went
on in those meetings.

Number two, Jeffrey -- on Monday,

10

I wanted to go to the rally.

Police officers

11

had yellow tape from 67th and Jeffrey to 71st

This is the component of the

16

is some type of protocol where there will be no

17

interference with the private securement of the

18

body.

19

just Michael the Archangel, of all the people

what's called the main core list.

9

FBI from claiming under supremacy clause, or

10

any other putative legal authority, the

11

authority to require local policing entities,

12

City of Chicago, Cook County, or State of

13

Illinois to depart the situation and leave the

14

investigation to the FBI.

17

secure the body and to get a private autopsy

18

and also secure the crime scene.

19

So what do I have to do to

20
