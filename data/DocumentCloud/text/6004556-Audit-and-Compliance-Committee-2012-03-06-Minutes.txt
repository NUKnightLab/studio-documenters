Board Action:

Review and File

Summary
 Identified through numerous regulatory references including the Department of Health and Human
Services, Office of Inspector General, as an important component of a compliance program and a
compliant organization.


It is the policy of CCHHS to refrain from employing, contracting with, accepting orders, or purchasing
items or services from sanctioned individuals or entities, identified through the sanction screening
process.



A sanction screening process applies consistent and reliable procedures to achieve compliance with
Federal and State health care programs’ prohibition on billing for any items or services provided,
ordered, or prescribed by individuals or entities that are excluded from participation in such programs.



The CCHHS process follows,
– All employees and vendors are assessed during the on-boarding process.
– Corporate Compliance, on a monthly basis, forwards a list of new employees to our external
vendor, John Sterling Associates. New employees are added to the existing employee list and are
screened against the OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities and the GSA Excluded Party List
System which also includes the U.S. Department of the Treasury Specially Designated Nationals
(SDN) List. The employees are also matched against the State of Illinois Provider Sanctions list.
Each month, Corporate Compliance receives the results of the screenings.
– On an annual basis a formal process occurs using a fresh download of all employees and CCHHS
vendors. The executive summary of the results of the formal process are included in this report.



Annual checks are necessary to exhibit due diligence to avoid harm to CCHHS.

 February 8, 2012
Cathy Bodnar, MS, RN, CHC
Chief Compliance Officer
Cook County Health & Hospitals System
1900 West Polk, Suite 123 Rm 118
Chicago, IL 60612
Dear Cathy:
A review of Cook County Health & Hospital System employees was conducted by
our office on February 7-8, 2012. These individuals were reviewed by checking
for name matches against the OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities and the
GSA Excluded Party List System which also includes the U.S. Department of the
Treasury Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List. As described below, they
also were matched against the State of Illinois Provider Sanctions list.
Based on data we received on February 7, 2012, we reviewed 6,105 employees
(after removing exact duplicates) for possible sanctions which could affect federal
or state healthcare funding.
Disclaimer
Results may be affected by inaccuracies in the data you provide to us. Since the
heart of the review is alphabetical matching, typographical errors, misspellings or
omissions in your data can result in match failure. Errors of a similar nature occur
in the federal or state databases as well. Federal or state databases also can
insert records retroactively after our review is completed. Errors in record layouts
of your data or federal or state data can negatively affect results. All these
irregularities cause match failure and are beyond our control.
It is our policy that the client bears responsibility to provide us with data that is
accurate with regard to spelling, date of birth, start date and other related
information. We make no effort to review the accuracy of your data.
Accordingly, we do not accept responsibility for any matching failures resulting
from erroneous data provided us by the client or by the federal or state
government databases.
Review Techniques
Social Security Numbers were not requested for each employee to preclude any
identity theft concerns. They are only requested on a case-by-case basis when
absolutely necessary to confirm or clear a possible exclusion.

Page 22 of 45

 We utilize proprietary computer-assisted techniques comparing your data to the
databases referenced below to generate possible matches to excluded parties.
The federal and sources of these data are described below. Recent copies of
each list were downloaded from the internet and were prepared for matching
using proprietary methods.
The OIG database contains names of over 48,000 persons sanctioned and
excluded from federal healthcare reimbursement.
The GSA system is comprised of Procurement/NonProcurement and Reciprocal
databases. Information on sanctions imposed on individuals and businesses by
53 other federal agencies is compiled in one location. This combined database is
the source of non-healthcare exclusions which must also be taken into account by
compliance programs. The GSA system lists over 9,000 individuals for nonhealthcare exclusions.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Controls, maintains
the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. This list contains individuals and
companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted
countries. It also contains non-country specific individuals, groups and entities
such as known terrorists and narcotics traffickers. Under Executive Order (EO)
13224 issued by the President in 2001, there are certain prohibitions from doing
business of any kind with over 4,000 people, organizations, and other entities that
appear on this list. While we check your data for any possible matches to this list,
we do not believe OIG has any real interest in this screening.
The State of Illinois Provider Sanctions list contained over 1,000 sanctioned
persons and businesses. You may access this list online at
http://www.state.il.us/agency/oig/download.asp .
When no match occurs, we assess that individual to be not excluded from federal
or state healthcare programs.
When a possible match does occur, our analysts then review each possible match
and perform any additional research as necessary to resolve each of these
matches. We utilize various logical tests and inferences to assess the validity of
the tentative match. The use of tests including comparisons of middle
initials/names, dates of birth, Social Security Numbers (when requested), start
dates, prior residence and other inferences permit us to assess whether or not
those individuals are excluded from federal or state healthcare programs.
Findings
Our research developed 795 possible matches to employees affiliated with Cook
County Health & Hospital System. After further review, we determined that none
of these matches were positive.

Page 23 of 45

 The file, Cook County Health & Hospital System Employee Screening Audit
Trial, shows our final assessments for all these employees. A CD hard copy of
the Audit Trail is being mailed to you along with a signed original of this Executive
Summary.
This Executive Summary has been emailed to you for early review.
Opinion Of Reviewer
Based on all the above information, procedures and techniques, and subject to
the limitations discussed above, it is my professional opinion that there are no
exclusions for all reviewed employees affiliated with Cook County Health &
Hospital System.
These employees will continue to be screened for any new exclusions through our
ContinueCheck® monthly rechecking service for the next 11 months as specified
in our contract. Cook County Health & Hospital System also may send us a list of
newly-hired employees each month to be included in this monthly rechecking.
This service is included, at no extra charge, in our annual screening service fees.
Sincerely,

Brady Ballman
Vice President

Cook County Health & Hospitals System
1900 West Polk, Suite 123 Rm 118
Chicago, IL 60612
Dear Cathy:
A review of Cook County Health & Hospitals System vendors was conducted by
our office on February 2-3, 2012. These vendors were reviewed by checking for
name matches against the OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities and the GSA
Excluded Party List System, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury Specially
Designated Nationals (SDN) List. They also were matched against the State of
Illinois Provider Sanctions list.
Based on the data we received on February 2, 2012, we reviewed 1,005 vendors
(after removing exact duplicates) for possible sanctions which could affect federal
or state healthcare funding.
Disclaimer
Results may be affected by inaccuracies in the data you provide to us. Since the
heart of the review is alphabetical matching, typographical errors, misspellings or
omissions in your data can result in match failure. Errors of a similar nature occur
in the federal and state databases as well. Federal and state databases also can
insert records retroactively after our review is completed. Errors in record layouts
of your data or federal and state data can negatively affect results. All these
irregularities can cause match failure and are beyond our control.
Therefore, we do not accept responsibility for any matching failures resulting from
erroneous data provided us by the federal and state government databases.
While we attempt to compensate for misspellings, truncations and other errors in
the data you give us, we also do not accept responsibility for any matching
failures resulting from errors in your data.
Review Techniques
We utilize proprietary computer-assisted techniques comparing your data to the
databases referenced below to generate possible matches to excluded parties.

Page 25 of 45

 The federal and state sources of these data are described below. Recent copies
of each list were downloaded from the internet and were prepared for matching
using proprietary methods.
The OIG database contains names of over 48,000 persons and over 2,100
organizations sanctioned and excluded from federal healthcare reimbursement.
The GSA system is comprised of Procurement/NonProcurement and Reciprocal
databases. Information on sanctions imposed on individuals and businesses by
53 other federal agencies is compiled in one location. This combined database is
the source of non-healthcare exclusions which must also be taken into account by
compliance programs. The GSA system lists over 9,000 persons and over 3,000

companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted
countries. It also contains non-country specific individuals, groups and entities
such as known terrorists and narcotics traffickers. Under Executive Order (EO)

business of any kind with over 4,000 people, organizations, and other entities that
appear on this list. While we check your data for any possible matches to this list,
we do not believe OIG has any real interest in this screening.
The State of Illinois Provider Sanctions list contained over 1,200 sanctioned
persons and businesses. You may access this list online at
http://www.state.il.us/agency/oig/download.asp .
When no match occurs, we assess that vendor to be not excluded from federal or
state healthcare programs.
When a possible match does occur, our analysts then review each possible match
and perform any additional research as necessary to resolve each of these
matches. While some of these matches are close in name, if through our
research it is clear that the two vendors are distinctively different, we assess them
as "Similar yet distinctively different. Not Excluded" and can be found in our Audit
Trail file. Matches that share the exact name or shortened form which need
further commenting are listed below.
Our review developed the following matches to Cook County Health & Hospitals
System vendors requiring further discussion:

Page 26 of 45

 Companies
Alliance Health Services Inc of Chicago, IL has a nearly identical name to a
listed company, Alliance HealthCare Services and Med of Glen Ellyn, IL. An
internet check indicates no connection between the two. Your vendor offers
consulting services while the excluded party is a DME. We assess that this is not
your vendor.
Phoenix Metal Products Inc of Freeport, NY has a name similar to a listed
company, Phoenix Products Co of Terryville, CT. Your vendor is a manufacturing
company of metal fabrication products for the medical and laboratory industries.
The excluded party sell pool chemicals. We assess that this is not your vendor.
Universal Medical Inc of Foxboro, MA has a name nearly identical to two listed
companies named Universal Medical, Inc. in Miami, FL and in Atlanta, GA. An
internet check indicates no connection to either. Many unrelated companies have
similar or even identical names. Further, a phone record search indicates the
excluded Miami DME is no longer in business. For all these reasons, we assess
that your vendor is not excluded.
One Word Vendors
There were a number of vendors in your data which are only one word.
Generally, these are contractions of vendor names or acronyms of professional
organizations. Among your “One Word Vendors”, ComEd was identified as
possible match. We performed internet checks on each vendor’s address and
determined the type of goods or services they provide Cook County Health &
Hospitals System. In each case there is a clear difference between your vendor
and the excluded party, so we assess that your vendor is not excluded.
Persons
Some of the possible matches were to individual persons. Whenever possible,
we assess them based on comparisons of middle initials, tax numbers and other
information available to us.
The remaining matches are to persons with addresses which differ from those of
the excluded parties. When there is no other means of clearing these persons
and there is no specific reason to believe they are actually excluded parties, it is
our policy to characterize them as "Not Excluded".
We found no excluded persons in your vendor data.
The file, Cook County Health & Hospitals System Vendor Audit Trail, shows
our assessments for each vendor. A CD hard copy of the Results file is being
sent to you by U.S. Postal Service along with a signed original of this summary
report.
This Executive Summary has been emailed to you for early review.

No action required – awareness

Summary
 Corporate Compliance education is recognized as a significant element of a Compliance Program. In
February 1998, the federal government, through the Department of Health and Human Services, Office
of Inspector General, published Compliance Program Guidance for Hospitals.1 In the Guidance, the
OIG identified “Effective Training and Education” as a key element to an effective compliance program.
Appropriate training and education was reiterated in the OIG’s Supplemental Compliance Program
Guidance for Hospitals in January, 2005.2


Implementation of Corporate Compliance and Patient Privacy (HIPAA) education through an electronic
learning management platform has commenced.



The use of an electronic learning management platform will provide, for the first time, clear monitoring
and tracking of not only Corporate Compliance and HIPAA education but all County Curriculum.

Audit and Compliance Committee
Cook County Health and Hospitals System
1900 West Polk Street
Chicago, Illinois 60612
Attention: Dr. Luis Munoz, Chairman
This letter is intended to communicate certain matters related to the planned scope and timing of our
audit of Cook County Health and Hospitals System’s (CCHHS) financial statements as of and for the year
ended November 30, 2011.
Communication
Effective two-way communication between our Firm and the Audit and Compliance Committee is
important to understanding matters related to the audit and in developing a constructive working
relationship.
Your insights may assist us in understanding CCHHS and its environment, in identifying appropriate
sources of audit evidence, and in providing information about specific transactions or events. We will
discuss with you your oversight of the effectiveness of internal control and any areas where you request
additional procedures to be undertaken. We expect that you will timely communicate with us any matters
you consider relevant to the audit. Such matters might include strategic decisions that may significantly
affect the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures, your suspicion or detection of fraud, or any
concerns you may have about the integrity or competence of senior management.
We will timely communicate to you any fraud involving senior management and other fraud that causes a
material misstatement of the financial statements, illegal acts that come to our attention (unless they are
clearly inconsequential), and disagreements with management and other serious difficulties encountered
in performing the audit. We also will communicate to you and to management any significant deficiencies
or material weaknesses in internal control that become known to us during the course of the audit. Other
matters arising from the audit that are, in our professional judgment, significant and relevant to you in
your oversight of the financial reporting process will be communicated to you in writing after the audit.
Independence
Our independence policies and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our firm
and its personnel comply with applicable professional independence standards. Our policies address
financial interests, business and family relationships, and non-audit services that may be thought to bear
on independence. For example, without our permission no partner or professional employee of
McGladrey & Pullen, LLP is permitted to own any direct financial interest or a material indirect financial
interest in a client or any affiliates of a client. Also, if an immediate family member or close relative of a
partner or professional employee is employed by a client in a key position, the incident must be reported
and resolved in accordance with Firm policy. In addition, our policies restrict certain non-audit services
that may be provided by McGladrey & Pullen, LLP and require audit clients to accept certain
responsibilities in connection with the provision of permitted non-attest services.

 The Audit Planning Process
Our audit approach places a strong emphasis on obtaining an understanding of how CCHHS functions.
This enables us to identify key audit components and tailor our procedures to the unique aspects of
CCHHS. The development of a specific audit plan will begin by meeting with you and with management
to obtain an understanding of CCHHS’s objectives, strategies, risks, and performance.
We will obtain an understanding of internal control to assess the impact of internal control on determining
the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures, and we will establish an overall materiality limit for audit
purposes. We will conduct formal discussions among engagement team members to consider how and
where your financial statements might be susceptible to material misstatement due to fraud or error.
We will use this knowledge and understanding, together with other factors, to first assess the risk that
errors or fraud may cause a material misstatement at the financial statement level. The assessment of
the risks of material misstatement at the financial statement level provides us with parameters within
which to design the audit procedures for specific account balances and classes of transactions. Our risk
assessment process at the account-balance or class-of-transactions level consists of:
An assessment of inherent risk (the susceptibility of an assertion relating to an account balance or
class of transactions to a material misstatement, assuming there are no related controls); and
An evaluation of the design effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and our
assessment of control risk (the risk that a material misstatement could occur in an assertion and
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by CCHHS’s internal control).
We will then determine the nature, timing and extent of tests of controls and substantive procedures
necessary given the risks identified and the controls as we understand them.
The Concept of Materiality in Planning and Executing the Audit
In planning the audit, the materiality limit is viewed as the maximum aggregate amount of misstatements,
which if detected and not corrected, would cause us to modify our opinion on the financial statements.
The materiality limit is an allowance not only for misstatements that will be detected and not corrected but
also for misstatements that may not be detected by the audit. Our assessment of materiality throughout
the audit will be based on both quantitative and qualitative considerations. Because of the interaction of
quantitative and qualitative considerations, misstatements of a relatively small amount could have a
material effect on the current financial statements as well as financial statements of future periods. At the
end of the audit, we will inform you of all individual unrecorded misstatements aggregated by us in
connection with our evaluation of our audit test results.
Our Approach to Internal Control Relevant to the Audit
Our audit of the financial statements will include obtaining an understanding of internal control sufficient to
plan the audit and to determine the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures to be performed. An
audit is not designed to provide assurance on internal control or to identify significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses. Our review and understanding of CCHHS’s internal control is not undertaken for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.
We will issue a report on internal control related to the financial statements. This report describes the
scope of testing of internal control and the results of our tests of internal controls. Our report on internal
control will include any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the system of which we
become aware as a result of obtaining an understanding of internal control and performing tests of
internal control consistent with the requirements of the Government Auditing Standards issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States.

 Using the Work of Internal Auditors
As part of our understanding of internal control, we will obtain and document an understanding of your
internal audit function. We will read relevant internal audit reports issued during the year to determine
whether such reports indicate a source of potential error or fraud that would require a response when
designing our audit procedures. Because internal auditors are employees, they are not independent and
their work can never be substituted for the work of the external auditor. We may, however, alter the
nature, timing, and extent of our audit procedures, based upon the results of the internal auditor's work or
use them to provide direct assistance to us during the performance of our audit.
Timing of the Audit
We have scheduled preliminary audit field work in February 2012 with final fieldwork commencing the
week of February 27, 2012. Management's adherence to its closing schedule and timely completion of
information used by us in performance of the audit is essential to timely completion of the audit.
Closing
We will be pleased to respond to any questions you have about the foregoing. We appreciate the
opportunity to be of service to Cook County Health and Hospitals System.
