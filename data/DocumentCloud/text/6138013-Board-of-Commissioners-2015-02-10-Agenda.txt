poses an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others; and (2) whether the subject is actively resisting
arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.
(b)
After gaining control of a subject, members of the Cook County Sheriff’s Department and Cook
County police officers as well as any private security personnel employed by Cook County shall:
(1) Avoid sitting, kneeling, or standing on a subject’s chest, which may result in

feasible, avoid placing the subject on his or her stomach;
(3) Monitor an arrestee until transported to a secure location; and,
(4) Seek medical attention for an arrestee who has injuries or illnesses
consistent with Sheriff’s Department Policy Directives.

employed by Cook County shall apply a choke hold in the performance of his or her duties unless faced
with a situation in which the use of deadly force is justified under applicable law. A choke hold shall
include but is not limited to, any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or hinder breathing
or reduce intake of air.
(d)
For purposes of this section the following terms shall have the following meaning: “Police officer”
