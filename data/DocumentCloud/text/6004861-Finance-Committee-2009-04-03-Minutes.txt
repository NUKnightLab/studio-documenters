From: Noe? G. Reyes
Management Analyst 

RE: Medassets Invoice

Please note that I have reviewed the amount of the invoice and have traced all of the supporting
amounts to the original source. These source documents consist of the individual Cash Reports
and Medicaid patient fee revenue spread sheets from the three different facilities namer John H.
Su'oger Jr. Hospital, Oak Forest Heapital, and Provident Hospital.

The methodology also incorporates and reduces the Medicaid receipts by an 8 million dollar
Fund Balance Reconciliation, for which I have a reference letter for, so it is incorporated on the
calculation. It is my opinion that based on the documents reviewed, Invoice number 075729

from Medassets, it is properly calculated.

Pitt, should you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to call me at extension 41956 or
to see me in person.

Sincerely,

Dear Bill:

Thanks for updating me regarding the System Board?s discussion as it relates to moving
forward with ICS in the strategic planning process. Pursuant to our conversation and as an
addendum to our March 31 Letter of Understanding (LOU). wish to con?rm the following as
it pertains to process scope: 

. We understand the importance of having community input at key junctures in the
process. and are highly supportive of the suggestion to expand on the number of
Town Hall meetings beyond the 4-5 meetings as identi?ed in our LOU. Accordingly,
we will commit to facilitating an additional 4?5 meetings, and will do so within our
original budget. (As we discussed, it may be determined that the number of meetings
should be extended beyond even this expanded number, in which case we would be
pleased to revise the scope of our agreement andIor work closely with your team to
provide support in having your management team members lead the facilitation in
certain instances as appropriate.)

- At the same time, we strongly support the suggestion that an interactive Website
could serve to enhance communications with key stakeholders throughout the
process. We will support the development of such a Website and the processing of
information thereby obtained within our agreed-upon scope of effort.

Our team concurs that both of these initiatives will result in bene?cial two?way
communications between the System and its constituencies as the process evolves.

We are delighted to have this opportunity to serve Cook County Health and Hospitals
System! I look forward to our meeting next Friday.

Sincerely,
INTEGRATED CLINICAL SOLUTIONS, INC.

(F) MINIMUM ANNUAL PAYMENTS.

(1) Pursuant to Section 15-10 of the Illinois Public Aid Code, the provisions of this Section become operative
only if all of the following conditions are satis?ed:

The federal government has approved a State plan amendment that permits disproportionate share
hospital adjustment payments to be made to hospitals operated by the SYSTEM.

Limitations driven by the federal government negatively impact the net revenues realized by the
PROVIDERS ?om the FUND during a State ?scal year by more than 15%, as measured by the aggregate
average net payment received by the county providers from the FUND from July 2007 through
May 2008.

The PROVIDERS have in good faith submitted timely, complete, and accurate cost reports and
supplemental documents as required by the DEPARTMENT.

The PROVIDERS maintain and bill for service volumes to individuals eligible for medical assistance
under this the PablicAid Code that are no lower than 35% of the volumes provided by and
billed to the DEPARTMENT by the PROVIDERS associated with payments received by the county 
providers from July 200':" through May 2003.

An appropriation, or other binding, is made available to the DEPARTMENT for the purpose of making a
payment, or otherwise making funds available, under this section to the hosPitaIs Operated by the
SYSTEM.

(2) Process by which the conditions in (I) are evaluated.

Approval of an amendinent to the Illinois Title XIX State plan to provide for disproportionate share
hospital adjustment payments to the hospitals operated by the SYSTEM.

The DEPARTMENT secured federal approval of State plan amendment transmittal number 08-06 on
December 4, 2008. 

Limitations immsed by the federal government through implementation or enforcement of a federal
regulation that negatively impacts net revenues realized by the PROVIDERS from the FUND.

The aggregate average net payment received by the PROVIDERS from the FUND from July 2007
through May 2008, was $17,549,353. The 35% benchmark is $14,916,950.

The 85% benchmark shall be compared to the quotient of the sum the net payments made by the
DEPARTMENT ?'om the FUND to the PROVIDERS during the State ?scal year for which the evaluation of
the condition is being made, divided by (ii) the integer 12 (months).

The PROVIDERS submit timely, complete, and accurate cost reports and supplemental documents as
required by the DEPARTMENT.

The number of services provided and billed to the DEPARTMENT by the PROVIDERS associated with
payments received by the PROVIDERS from July 200? through May 2008, for medical assistance under
the Illinois Public Aid Code-was 438,132. The 85% benchmark to be applied to State ?scal year 2009,
and subsequent State ?scal years, is 372,416 services.

The 85% benchmark shall be compared to the count of services provided and billed to the
DEPARTMENT by the PROVIDERS from the FUND, for medical assistance under the Public Aid
Code, during the State ?scal year for which the evaluation of the condition is being made.

The availability of appropriation authority to the DEPARTMENT for this purpose shall be determined
from a review of the annual and supplemental appropriations made to the DEPARTMENT for a given
State ?scal year by the General Assembly.

(3) if the conditions of subsection (1) are met, the DEPARTMENT shall, during the lapse period, make a payment
or otherwise make funds available to the hospitals operated by the SYSTEM that provides for total payments
to the PROVIDERS to be at least at a level that is equivalent to the total fee-for?service payments received by
the PROVIDERS that are enrolled with the DEPARTMENT to provide services during the ?scal year of the
payment from the FUND ?'om July 2007 through May 2003 multiplied by twelve-elevenths.

Addendum 1
Narrative of hospital inpatient rate calculation

Pursuant to the federally-approved Title XIX State plan, effective for services provided on after July 1, 2008,
hospital inpatient services shall be reimbursed using a per diam rate methodology. The per diam rate for each
hospital operated by the SYSTEM shall be calculated as follows:

(1)

(2)



(4)



The base period from which actual costs incurred and reported 15 the hospital ?scal year ending during the
calendar year that' is four years prior to the calendar year during which the payment period begins a, hospital
?scal year 2005 cost reports, as recorded' 111 the federal Healthcare Cost Report Information System and paid
claim data on record with the 

A base period cost for each hospital is determined as the sum, across all claims that were submitted by the
hospital for Medicaid covered services provided during hospital ?scal year 2005 and paid by the DEPARTMENT,
of the product resulting from multiplying each of the routine and ancillary charges on claimS by (ii) their
reapective cost-to-charge ratios from the cost report covering that hospital ?scal year

The resulting cost of Medicaid services is then adjusted by subtracting an amount that is the sum of all periodic
(weekly, quarterly, etc.) supplemental payments speci?ed in the Title XIX State plan, with the
exception of any payment that is classi?ed as a disproportionate share hospital adjustment payment, that are
expected to be made during the State ?scal year to which the rate applies. More: At this time, this adjustment
applies only to quarterly payments from ?re County Trauma Fund made to Stroger Hospital only.)

The resulting adjusted cost of Medicaid services is further adjusted to re?ect the change, from the midpoint of
base period hospital ?scal year to the midpoint of the State ?scal year to which the rate applies, in the CMS
(Medicare) hospital input price index.

The per diem rate is the quotient resulting from dividing the adjusted cost of Medicaid services by the number
of patient days on claims that were submitted by the hospital for Medicaid covered services provided during
hospital ?scal year 2005 and paid by the DEPARTMENT.

Addendum 2
Narrative of hospital outpatient rate calculation

Pursuant to the federally-approved Title XIX State plan, effective for services provided on a?er'JuJy 1, 2008,
heapital outpatient services shall be reimbursed using the DEPARTMENTS Ambulatory Procedure Group (APL) rates
and a hospital-speci?c cost-based multiplier for each group. The hoSpitalispeci?c cost-based multiplier for each
group shall be calculated as follows:

(1)

(2)

(6)

The base period ?'om which actual costs incurred and reported is the hospital ?scal year ending during the
calendar year that is four years prior to the calendar year during which the payment period begins hospital
?scal year 2005 cost reports, as recorded in the federal Healthcare Cost Report Information System, and paid
claim data on record with the DEPARTMENT).

A base period cost for each APL group is determined as the sum, across all claims that were submitted by the
hospital for Medicaid covered services provided during hospital ?scal year 2005 and paid by the DEPARTMENT,
of the product resulting from multiplying each of the routine and ancillary charges on claims by (ii) their
respective cost-to-charge ratios from the cost report covering that hospital ?scal year.

The resulting cost of Medicaid services is then adjusted by subtracting an amount that is the sum of all periodic
(weekly, quarterly, etc.) supplemental payments speci?ed in the Title XIX State plan, with the
exception of any payment that is classi?ed as a disproportionate share hospital adjustment payment, that are
expected to be made during the State fiscal year to which the rate applies. Wore: At this time, there are no
oppiicebiepaymeais to any of the hospitals operated by the SYSTEM.)

The resulting adjusted cost of Medicaid services is further adjusted to re?ect the change, from the midpoint of
base period hospital fiscal year to the midpoint of the State ?scal year to which the multiplier applies, in the
CMS (Medicare) hospital input price index.

The adjusted cost per APL service is the quotient resulting from dividing the adjusted cost of Medicaid services
by the number of claims that were submitted by the hospital for Medicaid covered services provided during

Addendum 3
Narrative of disproportionate share hospital adjustment payment calculation

Pursuant to the federally-approved Title XIX State plan, effective for services provided on after July I, 2008, the
hospitals operated by the SYSTEM shall receive disproportionate share hospital adjustment (DSH) payments. These
payments are intended to assist the PROVIDERS in covering the cost of services to uninsured individuals. They are
calculated as followsannual (federal ?scal year) basis, the DEPARTMENT will determine the amount of Illinois' DSH allocation
that is available to the hospitals operated by the SYSTEM. That amount is the difference between the federal
allocation for that period divided by the applicable federal medical assistance percentage and (ii) the sum of the
following, as estimated by the DEPARTMENT at the beginning of each annual period:

I The maximum amount allowed under federal law and the Title XIX State plan that may be paid to the
hospitals operated by the Department of Human Services.

. The maximum amount allowed under federal law and the Title XIX State plan that may be paid to the
hospital operated by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

I The maximum amount allowed under federal law and the Title XIX State plan that may be paid to the
hospitals operated by Illinois local governments other than the County of Cook.

. The amount to be paid to all other (non-public) hospitals that qualify of disproportionate share hospital
adjustment payments under 89 131'. Adm. Code the $5,000,000 pool).

The DEPARTMENT will determine the maximum amount allowed under federal law and the Title XIX State plan
that may be paid to the hDSpiials operated by the SYSTEM as a group and (ii) hospital-speci?c.

The lesser of the annual amount determined in step (1) and the maximum amount determined in step is the
DSH available to be paid to the hospitals operated by the SYSTEM.

Each of the hospitals operated by the SYSTEM will receive a DSH payment that is one-twelfth of the
product of the amount available from step (3) multiplied by (ii) the ratio of the hospital-speci?c maximum
DSH amount from step to the maximum group DSH amount from step 

At the beginning of the second federal ?scal year following the annual period for which the payments are made,
the DEPARTMENT will reconcile all DSH payments against the federal allocation for the payment period.
Payments to the hospitals operated by the SYSTEM may be adjusted to ensure that the entire federal allocation
is expended, (ii) DSH payments to the hospitals operated by the SYSTEM are maximized and all payments
are made in compliance with the federal law and the Title XIX State plan.

payments that were due prior to execution of the AGREEMENT will be paid subsequent to execution.

Notes on Implications of Federal Approval of Dis ro ortionate Share Fundin and New Rates
Methodolo for the Cook Conn Health Hos itals stem

 

- After months of System close collaboration with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services, the approval by CMS on December 4th of Illinois? Medicaid State Plan Amendment provides
for estimated (annualized) payments to of $133.8 million in state ?scal year 2009, and $150.0
million in state ?scal 2010;

I Offsetting these gains are the negative effects of lower inpatient per diem payment rates due to the
simultaneous implementation of a new ?cost limited? Upper Payment Limit (UPL) methodology the
net effect is assumed to be about $60?$70 million in a ?re-pricing? that will be conducted in April or
May; I

I Assuming SFY09 YTD actual Medicaid utilization growth the System?s net improvement in
revenues from these two offsetting factors is estimated at $70 million in 

I The new rate structure is retroactive to July 1, 2008; Also, a likely retroactive (one-time) opportunity
exists for DSH eligibility prior to July 1, 2008;

I Net per diem inpatient rates, excluding DSH, will change from a System global rate of $2,834 per day
to $1,457 (Stroger), $1,199 (Provident), and $1,014 (Oak Forest);

0 Certain Medicaid ambulatory services reimbursement rates, for services such as high tech diagnostics,
observation stays, and outpatient surgeries will increase; For example, the least complex outpatient
surgical procedure at Stroger HOSpital now will be reimbursed at $709 (net), whereas formerly the
payment was $390.

0 The System and the County currently are advocating for increased DSH cap for Illinois, and for
possible changes to the Medicaid Upper Payment limit for public, non?state hospitals;

An Overview the New Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) Governing
Medicaid Payments and Disproportionate Share (DSH) Payments to
Hospitals of the Cook County Health 8: Hospitals System

90



Background

0

In March, 2007, the Illinois Hospital Association convened its Medicaid Taskforee in order to prepare
recommendations to Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (I-IFS) on a proposed
renewal of the Illinois Hespital Assessment Program, then scheduled to expire June, 2003;

Cook County Hospitals had not participated in the previous Illinois Assessment program, but, with
support from allies of the System, the Taskforce Recommendations included a provision that assistance
to the Cook County System be part of the ?nal plan;

Over a period of months, and with the collaboration of HFS, the Of?ce of the President and the Board

of Commissioners, the Illinois Hospital Association, System consultanm, and others, a new Assessment

plan was recommended that contained provisions for Cook County Hospitals to realize available
monies in the federal DSH allocation for Illinois; 

Following rounds of negotiation, and technical discussions, in April, 2008, HFS submitted for approval
to CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) a State Plan Amendment (SPA) to implement
the new proposed Hospital Assessment plan, and the new plan re distribution of DSH monies to Cook
County; 

As required of I-IFS- by CMS, the State Plan Amendment proposed new limitations on aggregate
reimbursements to private and public hospitals through resnuctmed Upper Payment Limit 
methodologies; For public hospitals, the modi?ed would limit reimbursements for Medicaid
services to costs;

In May, 2008, the Illinois General Assembly approved the enabling legislation (8132857) supporting
enactment of the provisions of the 

91



On December 4, approved Illinois? Medicaid State Plan Amendment effective retroactively
to July 1, for a term of ?ve years;

0 Since December, CCI-IHS has worked with HFS to ?nalize the IGA necessary to implement the SPA, to

model the magnitude and timing of payment ?ows, and to design the mechanics of implementation of
the IGA, once it is executed;

Key features 04f the new (the ?Agreement?)

0 The Agreement amends the longstanding 1? governing fee-for?service payments for Medicaid
services to System Hospitals:

0 Reimbursements for hospital inpatient services, outpatient procedures, and emergency room
services are based upon actual costs, adjusted forward from a base year by a yearly in?ation index
(Addenda land 2 describe the methods of rate calculation);

0 Reimbursement methodology and rates for clinic encounters are unchanged;

0 The Agreement provides for DSH payments to System Hospitals from the Illinois federal 
allocation:

0 A ?oor of annual payments DSH payments to the System of approximately per year;

0 A variable, maximum of annual payments based upon the residual in the Illinois DSH allocation
after payments to Illinois DHS hospitals, (ii) University of Illinois hospitals, 
other public, non-state, local government hospitals, and other hospitals that are a ?xed
amount of aggregate payments to other hospitals;

92



0 Maximum DSH payment to each System Hospital is limited by its hospital speci?c cap.
And to the System by its system-wide cap;

0 DSH payments will be paid DSH payments are subject-to retrospective reconciliation;

Transition and Reconciliation

0 Following execution of the Agreement, I-IFS will re-price all System Medicaid claims since July 1,
2008, at the new reimbursement rates, creating a System debitto 

HFS will pay System Hospitals DSH monies accrued since July 1, 2008, less the debit from the
claims reconciliation; The agreement requires this process be completed by]une 30, 2009;

Execution of the Agreement Will trigger FMAP (Federal Matching Assistance Percentage)
adjustments, mandated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, retroactive to October
1, 2008, that will be factored into the re-pricing described above;

0 Execution of the Agreement will permit drawdown of retroactive DSH payments for the period
October 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008; HFS intends that these monies he ?ed issues
concerning clinic payments and the 3403 program;
