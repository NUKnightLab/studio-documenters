 MEETING MINUTES
PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on September 7, 2017, at 2:23 p.m. The
meeting was held at 121 N. LaSalle St., in Room 201-A.
Present:

Gabriel Ignacio Dziekiewicz
James Houlihan
Juan Moreno
Ernest Wong, Chair

Staff: Dijana Cuvalo
Kandalyn Hahn
Cindy Roubik
Larry Shure
The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 820 S. Michigan
4th Ward
Proposed Johnson Publishing Company Building
Proposed adaptive reuse of vacant commercial building into 150 dwelling units
including a new light well on the north (side) elevation, window replacement,
ground-floor retail space, and a 1-story rooftop addition and rooftop deck
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed butt-glazed window replacement system with new fullheight operable windows to meet natural ventilation code requirement
is approved as proposed. A glazing sample mock-up shall be provided
for staff review and approval as part of the permit application and
window shop drawings shall be provided for staff review and approval
prior to order and installation;
2. The new windows proposed for the 10th and 11th terrace levels are
approved to match the windows proposed for the other floors.
Although the recessed terraces are original features of the front facade,
these levels are so high up and creating a uniform front façade is not
an adverse effect on the building;
3. The new double-hung windows and light well on the north façade to
provide code-required natural light and ventilation for the residential
units is approved as proposed;
4. For the south facade, any unnecessary remnants are to be removed to
create a relatively flat surface for a substantial coating application over
the exposed concrete masonry unit portions that were left open when
the adjacent building was demolished due to public safety. The coating

 product information shall be included with the permit plans and the
color shall match the finished wall surface;
5. The 1-story rooftop addition proposed behind the existing rooftop sign
wall is approved as proposed; and,
6. The rooftop deck set back from the parapets per plans dated 8/8/17 is
approved with the condition that the railings be minimized as much as
possible by using clear glass or wire mesh paneling.
2. 1638 N. Sedgwick
2nd Ward
Old Town Triangle District
Proposed new construction of a 3 ½-story, multi-family, masonry building with a roof
deck and garage
Action:

Item was deferred by applicant; no action was taken by the Committee.

3. 855 N. Wolcott
1st Ward
East Village District
Proposed new construction of a 3 ½-story, multi-family, masonry building with a roof
deck and garage
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed standard and utility-sized dark red brick (Merlot Velour
Ironspot brick produced by Glen-Gery Brick) is approved. The
mortar color shall be changed to match the color of the face brick
rather than the proposed Pewter No.1319-06 grey mortar. Brick and
mortar samples shall be submitted with the permit application;
2. The cladding of the rooftop enclosure shall have a dark color;
3. In order to be more compatible with similar buildings types on the
block the front yard setback shall be increased to approximately 11’0”;
4. The side walls of the concrete front entrance stairs shall be clad with
face brick to be more compatible with historic stairs within the district;
and,
5. Proposed window and door details shall be submitted with the permit
application.
