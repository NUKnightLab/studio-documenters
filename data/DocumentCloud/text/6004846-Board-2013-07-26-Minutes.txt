Report from Chairman of the Board
A. Discussion of Committee Assignments and Board and Committee meetings times
Chairman Carvalho stated that he has received indications of interests from all of the Board Members with
respect to Committee assignments; he plans to contact the Directors over the weekend to make sure everyone
is comfortable with the tentative assignments that he has put together. The assignments do not require the
approval of the Board, so once he has had a chance to speak with everyone, the assignments can be made and
will be in effect immediately after they are announced.
With respect to Board and Committee meeting times, he stated that, as is required under the Open Meetings
Act, last year in December the Board adopted a schedule of meeting times and dates for 2013; this is done
before the beginning of each calendar year. He suggested that, for the month of August, the Board and
Committees should meet according to that schedule - each Committee at their August meeting can discuss
whether the same date and time should be kept or whether something different might be desirable for the
remainder of the 2013 schedule, starting in September. At the next Board Meeting, a report can be given from
each Committee regarding whether they want to continue to meet according to the schedule previously
adopted, or if they would like the Board to adopt a new schedule for their 2013 meetings.
Chairman Carvalho stated that one of the other matters that the Committees should discuss, and be prepared to
discuss as a Board at the next meeting, is the 2014 Board schedule and Committee scheduling options. He
asked that the Board be prepared to discuss whether Friday mornings at 8:00 A.M. will continue to be an
appropriate time for the Board to meet; additionally, the Board can discuss options for scheduling Committee
meetings. Some of those options include identifying opportunities for scheduling some meetings back-to-back
on the same day, or having the Committees and the Board all meet on the same day.
Chairman Carvalho encouraged any of the Directors to make suggestions for any other options. Director
Lerner noted that the Board needs to strike a balance between paying attention to the fact that it operates under
the Open Meetings Act, while also minimizing the hassle factor and the work of the staff. He stated that one
of the reasons why many other organizations have gone to a consolidated schedule is because it really focuses
the staff’s attention to one or two days, instead of being spread out over a series of days in a month - having
staff attend so many different functions takes their eyes off the ball on the other things they need to get done.
During the presentation of the Chairman’s report, Letty Close, Chief of Staff to the Chief Executive Officer,
introduced and welcomed individuals who were present who are participating in a fellowship program
operated through the President’s office and sponsored by the Civic Consulting Alliance.

B. Board Education - Set Targets Achieve Results (STAR) Report (Attachment #2)
Dr. Krishna Das, System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation, provided an
overview of the information contained in the STAR Report. The Board reviewed and discussed the
information.

Report from Chairman of the Board
B.

Board Education - Set Targets Achieve Results (STAR) Report (continued)
With regard to wait times, Director Collens inquired whether the wait time in the emergency room for patients
who are non-emergent is dramatically different from the wait time of a patient who is in the emergency room
for a true emergency. Dr. Das responded that staff reviews the data on wait times for patients who are
admitted versus those patients who are discharged. For patients who are discharged, the wait times are longer;
the implication is that the patients who are admitted are the sickest of the population, and their wait times are
shorter. To more specifically answer whether staff has a true sense of the wait times for patients who are only
seeking primary care, Dr. Das stated that she will refer that question to the Emergency Department and see if
they separate that data out1.
Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding the development of measures, targets and format for the STAR Report;
it was noted that the STAR Report is compiled and issued through the President’s Office. Chairman Carvalho
stated that, in prior meetings, Dr. Das has presented a quality dashboard. The first iteration of that did not have
national benchmarks, so it was hard to put it into context; later, when some of the percentile measures were
included in the more recent dashboards, it dramatically put things into context. He stated that in the absence of
some benchmark or understanding as to how the targets are set, the Board does not have a way to see if they
are ambitious targets. Dr. Das stated that the System is at liberty to set its own choice of metrics for the STAR
Report; with input from the Board and Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, the administration can make
those choices. With regard to the more general question about how these metrics and targets are selected, she
stated that there is an immense amount of quality and benchmark data, so the STAR Report is really a highlevel presentation of specific benchmarks that the System has chosen.
Chairman Carvalho stated that he wanted to introduce this as a topic so the Board has some understanding of
how to respond to this report, and also to suggest that the appropriate committees might want to go into that in
some more detail, inasmuch as this is not an internal document. Dr. Das stated that the System’s quality data
can be presented in more detail to the Committees and Board.
Director Lerner stated that his presumption is that this data is vetted by the Quality and Patient Safety
Committee; however, this Report takes it a step further, where it starts to link quality and finance, in a way that
most places have not done. Additionally, with regard to CountyCare and any type of managed care, how one
measures the quality and financial indicators of managing a population is going to be very different, and really
crosses over to two committees.
Chairman Carvalho agreed. Independent of this Report, in the Quality and Patient Safety Committee there has
been the development of the dashboard and measures that go into greater detail than this; in the Finance
Committee it is less well developed, but the Finance Committee has been working towards a dashboard and
financial measures that also go beyond, but obviously derived from the same data as this report. He stated that
this report brings it all together, but there is more in-depth work done at the committee level.
In response to a question from Director Collens regarding a reference in the report relating to the Department
of Justice (DOJ) and Cermak Health Services, Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, stated that the
County of Cook is subject to a Consent Decree - both the Cook County Department of Corrections under the
Sheriff, as well as Cermak Health Services, which is the health facility within the Department of Corrections,
are involved. Staff routinely comes before this Board for the Cermak part of it, to give an update on the status
of monitoring. This matter is before the Federal District Court. Mainly on the System’s end, it is in
compliance, except with regard for the staffing plan, but efforts are being made to quickly come into
compliance.

Report from Chairman of the Board
B.

Board Education - Set Targets Achieve Results (STAR) Report (continued)
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr. Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the Office of the State’s Attorney, provided
additional information. He stated that the Consent Decree was entered into by agreement in June 2010,
following a two-year negotiation period with the DOJ. A lot of progress has been made; many areas are in
substantial compliance, and other areas are in partial compliance. He noted that the medical monitor recently
submitted his seventh report, and then resigned, so there will be a replacement of the medical monitor in the
next month or two.
With regard to the data on patients who leave the emergency room without being seen, Director Butler noted
that the percentage of people leaving without being seen is just about the same at Stroger Hospital as it is at
Provident Hospital. He inquired whether data is available regarding how long those patients wait before
leaving. Dr. Das indicated that she will get that data for him from the Emergency Department2.
With regard to the data on patient satisfaction, Director Lerner stated that, he would like to congratulate the
staff because for a public safety net institution, these are astronomically high numbers compared to most other
safety net institutions; he noted that most people who go to a safety net institution do not want to be there
compared to other places that they might want to be. However, he stated that when the System moves toward
pay-for-performance, and payment is linked to patient satisfaction, this is another indicator where quality and
finance come together, so more and more attention will need to be paid to patient satisfaction. Discussions
have been held in other arenas to try to get the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to change
its standards and recognize that safety net institutions should be evaluated under a different basis than, for
example, suburban institutions; the System will need to be diligent in working towards improving patient
satisfaction because regulations and payment policies are not expected to change anytime soon.
Dr. Raju stated that the data shows that there is a lot of work to be done to improve the patient experience
component of this. The two factors that come into play are: 1) adequate staff is needed to take care of the
patients to make their experience better; and 2) the culture of the staff needs to change so that the patients feel
listened to and welcomed. Because this is so important to the System’s transformation, a new position of
Patient Satisfaction Officer has been created; that person will be responsible for monitoring patient
satisfaction. The position will report to Strategic leadership, so there will be an independent view of what is
happening. He added that recruitment for the position is active.
Director Muñoz inquired as to how this information is being shared with those who can affect change. Dr. Das
responded that, in the last year, the administration has made a very big effort to get this data out in a variety of
forms, to management across the System, as well as to all of the staff. Besides presenting it here, it has been
presented it to the Executive Medical Staffs (EMS), because the administration feels that EMS needs to take
ownership of this data; therefore, it has been presented in great detail to the physicians in the Ambulatory
Network and at Provident and Stroger Hospitals. It has been presented to nursing leadership – nursing takes
their unit-specific data, posts it on the unit, nursing managers on the unit discuss the scores with their staff
during their regular meetings, and they have prioritized improvement within all the units at Stroger Hospital.
In addition, Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of Clinical Integration, has presented this at System leadership
meetings, so it has reached all of the different levels.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #3)
Dr. Raju provided an update on the following subjects: CountyCare; Joint Commission Accreditation; Legislation;
FY2014 Budget; Oral Health; and Recognition of Employees.
Dr. Raju provided additional information on the update on CountyCare. He stated that the System just passed its
six-month mark with CountyCare; 80,679 applications have been initiated, so the System is quickly approaching the
goal of 115,000. The System has done very well with the help of a lot of folks - there was enormous media
outreach and community support; he thanked his staff, as well as the community leaders and a lot of people who
worked to make this happen. He noted that his written report (Attachment #3) states the number of applications that
have been initiated as 76,000; he sends a newsletter every month, and when it went to press there were 76,000
applications initiated, but now that number has reached over 80,000.
In response to a question from Director Velasquez regarding the initiated applications that have been approved, Dr.
Raju responded that some of that information was included at the Finance Committee Meeting. The State has
increased the number of people who are going to validate applications to 103 people. These people are all located
in the space leased by the System, which is very close to Stroger Hospital. They have started turning over more
applications, and there is a little bit of lag time in catching up, but he was assured by the State that they will do
everything possible to get the applications together. He added that there has been significant improvement in the
last couple of weeks.
With regard to the update on the FY2014 Budget, Chairman Carvalho stated that, at the Finance Committee
Meeting, there was a preliminary conversation about a timeline that involved the Finance Committee getting the
Preliminary Budget at one meeting and the Board adopting it a week later; however, he stated that it looks like this
was revised to now allow for a more stretched-out process. He stated that it is nonetheless an aggressive schedule,
just by its nature. He provided an overview of the process. The System’s Finance Committee reviews and
recommends adoption of the budget, and submits it to the System Board for adoption. Upon System Board
adoption, it is submitted to the Cook County Board for them to adopt it in totality or not, without amendment. If
the Cook County Board adopts it, it is then submitted to the County Board President, who wraps her entire budget
for Cook County around the System’s budget and submits it back to the Cook County Board. The Cook County
Board considers that entire proposed County Budget, which includes the System’s budget - at that time, if they
choose, they may consider amendments to any components of the proposed County budget, and when that budget is
adopted it becomes the budget of the County. The County’s fiscal year starts December 1st, and many of these steps
have timelines written in ordinance or statute. If the President and the Cook County Board want the budget to be
adopted before the fiscal year begins, then they have to start that process by a certain date. He noted that there are
pressures built into the system for each step of the way to be done with some dispatch, and appreciated that Dr. Raju
has developed this timeline that is going to allow the System Board a little more time to look over the budget.

RAM RAJU, MD, MBA, FACHE, FACS 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM 
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
July 26, 2013 
 
 
COUNTYCARE UPDATE 
 
We just passed the six month mark of enrolling eligible adults in CountyCare, a program designed to 
expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I am happy to report that our hard work, dedication to 
our patients and the larger community is paying off. 
 
To date, we have more than 76,000 applications initiated and we continue to work closely with the State 
of Illinois on getting people enrolled into the program. 
 
CountyCare is a critical step in the massive transformation of our system. We must adapt to the new 
way of providing care to ensure that the public health system, a critical player in the health of our 
communities, remains a viable and valued partner.   
 
 
 
JOINT COMMISSION ACCREDITATION UPDATE 
 
Stroger Hospital underwent an unannounced accreditation survey by the Joint Commission on 
November 3rd, 2012.  As often happens, the surveyors identified several areas for improvement.  The 
required improvements were made and the results monitored for 4 months.  We received notification 
on 9th July that we had received a designation of ‘Accredited’ by the Joint Commission with a certificate 
valid for 3 years from the original survey, or until November 2015. 
 
Provident Hospital will not be up for accreditation until October of 2014. 
 
The Ambulatory Health Network is now eligible for their triennial survey.  The last ACHN survey was in 
April of 2011, and typically a survey will take place anywhere between 27 and 36 months following the 
previous survey.  These are unannounced surveys and we emphasize continual readiness. At the same 
time, we plan to give extra attention to areas which surveyors are usually interested in, such as the 
building safety systems and infection control, and we will be reassessing all our policies and procedures 
to ensure they comply with current law and regulation. We also review reports of previous surveys to 
ensure that corrective measures required from previous surveys were implemented completely and are 
showing sustained results.  
 

Page 51 of 54

 The Joint Commission has deeming authority from CMS, and this means that being accredited by Joint 
Commission signifies that we are in compliance with all of the Medicare hospitals conditions of 
participation. 
 
 
LEGISLATIVE UPDATE 
 
nd
On Monday, July 22 , I joined Governor Quinn as he signed SB26 into law and had the opportunity to 
speak about the importance of the legislation to the transformation of the Cook County Health and 
Hospitals System.  SB26, commonly referred to as the Medicaid Expansion bill, enacted a critical part of 
the Affordable Care Act by expanding Medicaid coverage to a new population of eligible adults in Illinois.  
Attending the press conference were bill sponsors Senator Heather Steans and State Representative 
Sara Feigenholtz, along with Senator Jackie Collins, Senator Iris Martinez and State Representative 
Barbara Flynn Curie.  Also in attendance were Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services 
Director, Julie Hamos, Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, Illinois 
Hospital Association President/CEO Maryjane Wurth and SEIU Healthcare President Keith Kelleher.  
 
 
FY2014 BUDGET UPDATE 
 
Budget Director Aaron Galeener and his staff have been meeting internally for several weeks with 
CCHHS Departments and evaluating our needs for the coming fiscal year.  CCHHS’s Budget Department 
recently began discussions with the County Budget Office on the FY 2014 budget.  Those discussions are 
on‐going and we expect to finalize our budget by early August.  The proposed FY2014 CCHHS Budget will 
be presented to the CCHHS Board of Directors for review and consideration and then to the Cook 
County Board for consideration and approval.  Below is the anticipated Budget timeline:

 ORAL HEALTH UPDATE 
 
CCHHS provides general dental services at the CORE Center, Cermak Health Services and at the Juvenile 
Temporary Detention Center (JTDC).  General dental services are also provided at the Bridgeview and 
Rolling Meadows courthouses, the Ford Heights‐ACHN Cottage Grove Clinic and at Community Health’s 
West Town Clinic.  Oral Surgery is performed at Stoger Hospital. 
 
In 2012, CCHHS entered into a collaborative agreement with Community Health to expand and enhance 
dental services for Cook County residents through utilization of Community Health’s two Chicago dental 
clinics located in West Town and Englewood.   
 
In July 2013, CCHHS relocated services from Maywood to Community Health’s West Town location.  This 
move created access to oral health services for Chicago residents as well as west suburban Cook 
residents.  Prior to this change, access to comprehensive dental services was provided by CCHHS only at 
locations suburban Cook County. 
 
Renovation of Community Health’s Englewood Clinic is expected to complete by January 2014 and will 
further expand oral health care services provided by CCHHS. 
 
CCHHS’s collaboration with Community Health expands community‐based preventive and 
comprehensive oral health services in Cook County and maximizes existing provider capacity.  Creation 
of these type public‐private partnerships help to strengthen and enhance the dental care delivery 
system for our patients. 
 
 
RECOGNITION 
 
This  month  I  would  like  to  recognize  four  members  of  our  Human  Resources  Staff.    The  following 
individuals played a critical role in the annual on‐boarding of our House Staff earlier this month.   
 
Sandra Hernandez – Human Resources Specialist, started her career with CCHHS on June 17, 2013 in 
the middle of House Staff processing.   She did not hesitate to jump right in and assist where and 
when she could.  She brings eight years of Human Resources experience to the organization and has 
already proven to be an asset to the team. 
 
 
Jasmaine Ison – Human Resources Specialist, has been with the Human Resources Department since 
November 8, 2010.  Ms. Ison started her career as a Receptionist and quickly proved to be an 
outstanding employee.  After completing one year of service, the opportunity to apply for a Human 
Resources Specialist position became available.  Ms. Ison applied and was promoted into the 
position.  This year, her role in House Staff processing ensured that our new physicians records were 
complete allowing for them to be on‐boarded by July 1st. 
 
Ermis Maldonado – Human Resources Receptionist, began her employment as a temporary 
employee and immediately proved to be the type of person the HR department needed at the Front 
Desk to welcome and interact with both internal and external customers.  When the position 
became available on a full time basis, Ms. Maldonado applied and on April 23, 2013 she became a 
permanent member of the HR team.  Referred to, by some staff, as “Mama Ermis”, she is attentive 
to the needs of employees and customers alike.  She is professional and adept at multi‐tasking in a 
3   P a g e  
 

Page 53 of 54

 very busy environment.  Ermis was an intergral member of the HR team during House Staff 
processing, lending support by providing up‐to‐the minute reports on the status of the processing 
operation. 
 
Kamini Patel – Human Resources Specialist, has been employed with the County since April 8, 1991.  
She began her career in the Labs and in 1995 transferred to the Human Resources Department.  In 
2010 when the HR Department was restructured, she applied for and was promoted into her current 
position of HR Specialist.  Ms. Patel is detailed oriented and like her co‐workers is an important 
member of the HR team.   Ms. Patel worked quickly and efficiently during the processing of the 
incoming House Staff and made sure that all required documents were submitted and processed. 
 
 
I  thank  them  for  their  hard  work  and  their  commitment  to  the  Cook  County  Health  and  Hospitals 
System.
