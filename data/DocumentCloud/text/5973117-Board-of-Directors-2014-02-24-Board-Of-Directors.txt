 Energy Initiative #1, Municipal Retrofit

Municipal Retrofit
Initiative
Description

• Design and fund a comprehensive municipal energy efficiency program. Raise ~$1B in
private capital to save >10% energy in public facilities, reduce long-term City energy
costs, create jobs, and make Chicago the greenest city in the world

Catalyst

• City is looking to make critical infrastructure upgrades to aging building systems, but
does not want to threaten credit rating by using bonding capacity for projects with strong
energy efficiency ROI

• City is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as related pollutant
emissions from stationary (i.e., building) usage
• Researching and developing optimal financing options

CIT’s Value

• Extending City’s borrowing capacity through off-credit, off-balance sheet transactions
that do not monopolize bonding capacity
• Using a single, emerging financial instrument to reduce barriers and finance municipal,
not-for-profit/cultural institution and home energy efficiency projects
• Aggregating retrofit projects across the City to increase scale, improve economics,
quicken pace, and heighten impact

Impact

• Achieves Mayor’s 2015 Sustainability Goal #4 – Improve overall energy efficiency in
municipal buildings by 10%
• Leads by example in use of off-credit, off-balance sheet financing mechanisms wellsuited for use in other sectors across the City

 Energy Initiative #1, Municipal Retrofit

Retrofit 2.0 LED Street Light Energy Efficiency Replacement
Program: Request for Information (RFI)
Program
description

• Replace Chicago’s 317,000+ Street Lights with high efficiency white light LEDs
• Create a Smart Network Lighting System, which will serve as a platform to provide
operational efficiencies and revenue opportunities

BEFORE

• Privately finance the project; costs are repaid through energy and O&M savings
• City seeks to reduce structural costs, energy consumption and pollution emissions

Catalyst

• The cost and quality of LED lights have improved dramatically in recent years
• LED lighting conversion has generated a return on investment, but upfront capital is a
barrier
• CDOT sponsored a “White Light LED” pilot and requested equipment demonstrations

CIT’s
Value

AFTER

• CIT will pursue a new model construct - Lighting As A Service Performance
Agreement which involves a Build Operate Manage (BOM) arrangement
• CIT will negotiate with LED and network control firms to provide all of the upfront
capital, manage the installation process and monitor the street light system network
• Program participants will be selected via a competitive, technology-neutral
procurement process and will be paid through project savings

• CIT will investigate potential for citywide digital signage for multi-use purposes
• Achieve energy and cost savings between 50% and 80% and improve ambient lighting

Impact

• Create jobs and reduce the impact of greenhouse gases

• LEDs last longer than incumbent units (10-15 years versus 4-6 years) and fail at a
lesser rate than incumbent technologies, reducing maintenance costs
• The street light network will have adaptive controls with wireless links to the fixtures,
which can adjust light levels and provide maintenance feedback
• Street lights as a platform can create a smart network that provides revenue and
operational opportunities

STREET LIGHT AS A
PLATFORM
• Video
• Sound
• Security
• Meter-reading
• Etc.

CONFIDENTIAL DRAFT

18

 Energy Initiative #1, Municipal Retrofit

Retrofit 2.0 RFI: Street Lights as a Platform
• Historically, street lights have been static pieces of infrastructure with one dimension

Overview

Platform
Opportunities

• Street lights are unique in that they cover almost every portion of the City and can
network into a smart grid that is interactive and provides additional operational and
revenue opportunities
• Communication. Digital display and audio connections can be used for advertising
to generate revenue streams and also enable mass public announcements and
displays regarding safety, events, alerts, traffic, weather, navigation, etc.
• Big data potential. Real time data collection and storage can provide the city with
unprecedented information at the street level that can be relevant for public safety
• Greater connectivity for residents. Wi-Fi hot spots can provide citywide internet
access
• Traffic and safety management. Intelligent communication and response with
street lights can help alleviate traffic congestion and guide emergency vehicles more
safely to their destinations
• Car charging. Solar or grid-connected charging stations on lamp posts
• Video. Potential to incorporate video camera into light fixture

Operational
Improvement

• Intelligent controls, maintenance. Real time monitoring can also instantly alert the
network of equipment malfunction, enabling rapid repair deployment and eliminating
the need for repair crew patrolling
• Smart illumination. On demand sensor technology can respond to the environment
according to circumstance, by dimming or illuminating as appropriate
• Advanced metering. The lighting receiver can collect and transmit meter reading
information for utility providers (gas, water, electric, etc.)
• More efficient billing. A GPS receiver is installed in each light to provide precise
location monitoring and in turn simplifies billing and inventory efforts

CONFIDENTIAL DRAFT

 Energy Initiative #1, Municipal Retrofit

Retrofit 2.0 RFI: LED Street Light Conversion Examples
• Lighting accounts for 19% of electricity consumption worldwide

Potential
Impact

• Street lighting solutions can save $13.27 billion per year in worldwide energy costs

Los Angeles
Program

• In 2009, the City was operating 140,000 street lights (each with a 4 – 6 year lifespan)
that cost up to $52 million in operations and maintenance and used 197 million KWH per
year

• LED lighting can generate anywhere from 50 – 70% energy savings, 80% when paired
with smart controls

• The City explored replacing these lights with LED technology (10 – 12 year lifespan) in 5
years with a total project cost of $57 million and the following projections:

•
•
•

Reduce carbon emissions by 40,591 metric tons
Reduce energy usage by 69 million KWH
40% energy savings

• As of 2011, the City has installed 36,500 LED street lights with the following results:

• Reduced carbon emissions by 8,674 metric tons
• Reduced energy usage by 15 million KWH
• 57.6% energy savings
Mayor’s
Lighting
Partnership

• Sponsored by Philips, several cities have chosen to upgrade their street lighting
networks to improve sustainability, reduce energy costs, and promote public safety and
economic development at no upfront costs
• Boston converted thousands of street lights to LED, saving $1 million and 8.9 million
KWH in electricity per year
• Tampa saved $92,000 per year in energy and maintenance costs and reduced usage by
738 KWH per year

• Repurpose underutilized City property into revenue generating CNG stations
• Collaborate with 2FM to develop new alternative fuel vehicle acquisition and
management plan
• Serve as intermediary between fueling providers, auto manufacturers, corporate
