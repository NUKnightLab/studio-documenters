On October 5, 2005 , the Cook County Board of Commissioners authorized the County to enter into
negotiations with the National Association of Counties (''NA Co") to offer the "Cook County Prescription
Discount Card Program" to all residents of Cook County. Although the deadlines set forth in that
resolution have since passed, I felt strongly that the program was worth investigating, and authorized my
staff to negotiate an agreement with NACo.
I am hereby requesting the authorization and execution of the Managed Pharmacy Benefit Services
Agreement by and between the County of Cook and CaremarkPCS Health, L.P. ("Caremark") (the
"Agreement"). The Agreement wi ll provide an average of twenty percent (20%) discount to any Cook
County resident that uses the discount card on prescriptions that are not covered by insurance, and there is
no cost to Cook County for the program.
The Agreement will allow Cook County residents who either lack or have insufficient prescription
insurance coverage to obtain a discount on prescription medication at any of the thousands of
participating pharmacies in Cook County. I submitted a Fact Sheet that includes many of the pertinent
details related to this Agreement, and I encourage you to support execution of the Agreement.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the request of the President of
the Board of Commissioners be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

Security Income/Social Security Disability Income Services for Cook County Bureau of Health Services
institutions.
Board approved amount 06-20-06:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$1,425,000.00
4,000,000.00
$5,425,000.00

The amendment is to provide comprehensive on-site inpatient eligibility services at Stroger
Hospital of Cook County. C hamberlin Edmonds and Associates, Inc. will provide bi-lingual
staff to augment the current staffing at Stroger Hospital of Cook County to perform the
eligibility services including the initial Medicaid application process for these patients.
Chamberlin Edmonds and Associates, Inc. will seek coverage for Stroger Hospital's patients
under all potential programs including but not limited to Medical Assistance-No Grant (MANG), State and Federal Disability Programs, Crime Victims, Section 1011 , and other relevant
benefit programs. Furthermore, they will provide limit of liability (LOL) training for current
Bureau of Health Services staff and actively monitor the referral process.

and Medicare reimbursements. The expiration date of the current contract is June 30, 2009.

Transmitted herewith is a request to present a draft proposal to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County for the adaptive reuse for the old Cook County Hospital (CCH). This proposal encourages the
preservation and the rehabilitation of the old CCH by adapting it into an administration building for the
Stroger Hospital of Cook County (JHS) Campus.
This plan will retain the old Cook County Hospital as a functional component of the County and provides
for the use of the old CCH as office space to accommodate the current occupants of the 1900 West Polk
Street building. This new space will satisfy the functions of the 1900 West Polk Street building and will
also provide for space for other services in the future, including a day care center.
This plan will also encourage the historical preservation of the old Cook County Hospital, whi le at the
same time provide the County an energy efficient sustainable building technology that will merit LEED
certification. A new road between Fantus Clinic and the old CCH will be constructed to alleviate traffic
congestion during peak hours at the hospital and a large area of the JHS Hospital Campus can be
developed into a user friendly, sustainable, urban green space that will not only provide for the renewal of
Pasteur Park, but will also complement the JHS Hospital Campus and promote the overall revitalization
of this west side community.
We look forward to presenting the benefits of this plan for your review.

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY CLERK
CONTRACTS
Transmitting a Communication from
DAYID ORR, County Clerk
by
CLEM BALANOFF, Director of Elections
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Lake County Press (LCP),
Waukegan, Illinois, for ballot printing services. The proposed agreement will cover the printing,
packaging, and delivery of ballots for the 2008 Primary and General Elections. This will also cover the
printing, folding and mailing of all Absentee Ballots for the same elections.

2777

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 3 1, 2007

Reason:

The Cook County C lerk's office provides voters the option of voting on optical scan paper
ballots. These paper ballots are inserted into a machine that reads the ballot and records those
votes. In order to accurately record the votes, the ballots must be printed within extremely tight
tolerances. Paper width, ink densities, and ballot alignment must meet strict criteria. Any
vendor wishing to print ballots for the C lerk 's office must be certified by Sequoia Voting
Systems, Inc. (Sequoia) to print ballots to be used with the equipment the Clerk's office has
purchased from them. Sequoia's certification process costs a vendor in excess of $10,000.00
and requires that vendor to have suitable printing presses which guarantee consistency within
the tolerances prescribed. LCP has recently purchased state of the art presses that perform to
these expectations. Their experience and past success printing ballots for the Clerk's office
eliminates risks inherent with any untried and untested vendor.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1 ,009, 114 .00 $1,650,086.00 (FY 2007: $468,200.00; and FY 2008:
$ 1, 181,886.00). Contract period: September 1, 2007 through November 30, 2008. (524-240 Account).
Requisition Nos. 75240080 and 85240002.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 and future year funds.
The Chieflnformation Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the request of the Director of
Elections be approved, as amended and that the County Purchasing Agent be authorized to enter into the
requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

Transmitting a Communication from
DA YID ORR, County C lerk
by
CLEM BALANOFF, Director of Elections
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Sequoia Voting Systems,
Inc., Oakland, California, for election support for the 2008 and 2009 elections. This will cover software
updates, training, technical support, Pre-Election Day, Election Day, and Post-Election Day support.
Reason:

Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. is in the unique position of being the only vendor able to
provide these services due to its possession of patents, copyrights, and proprietary information
involving election equipment, software, and hardware previously purchased by the C lerk's
office with approval of the Board. Sequoia has provided election support since the 2006
Primary Election. This experience allows Sequoia to respond to the issues involved in
running elections in a jurisdiction the size of Cook County. As the vendor for Cook County
and the Chicago Board of Elections, Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. possesses valuable
institutiona l knowledge. There is no possibility that any other vendor could acquire that same
knowledge base in the limited amount of time between now and the 2008 Primary Election,
which would pose significant risk to the success of that election and following elections
through 2009.

Director.

If such a request is at the time of applying for reappointment, the request shall be considered pursuant to
Article 4, Section 4.06, Procedures for Reappointment.
If such a request is not in conjunction with a request for reappointment, an evaluation of the requested
change in clinical privileges shall be based on the Appointee's training, experience, and demonstrated
competence and performance. All such requests shall be forwarded to the Department Chairperson who
shall be responsible for making a written recommendation and shall then forward the request, together

review of the licensure of the Applicant as well as other information that may reasonably be relied upon
to assess the competency and ethical standing of the individual. In exercising such privileges, the
Appointee shall act under the supervision of the Chairperson of the Department to which he or she is
assigned or under the supervision of an Appointee from that Department selected by the Chairperson.
Temporary clinical privileges may be granted for the care of (a) specific patient(s) to a practitioner who is

read copies of the Medical Staff Bylaws and relevant departmental policies and agrees to be bound by the
terms thereof and with all application Rules and Regulations in all matters relating to his or her temporary
c linical privileges.

2. Termination or Expiration of Temporarv Privileges
The grant of temporary privileges shall continue until (i) the application for membership is approved or
denied, (ii) the specific patient is discharged or (iii) such privileges expire or are terminated as provided
herein. Temporary privileges may be granted for a period of no longer than three (3) months and may be
renewed for one (1) additional three (3) month period pursuant to the process set forth in this section.

2820

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2007

Special requirements of supervision and reporting may be imposed by the appropriate Department
Chairperson on any practitioner granted temporary privileges. Temporary privileges may be terminated
immediately by the Chief Operating Officer on the recommendation of the President of the Medical Staff,
Medical Director or the Chairperson of the Department concerned upon notice of any fai lure by the
practitioner to comply with such special conditions, or where significant concerns regarding the quality of
patient care provided by the Practitioner's clinical competence, or the Practitioner's professional conduct
have been identified.

or her absence, the Medical Director, shall assign a member of the Medical Staff to assume responsibility
for the care of such terminated practitioner's patient(s) until such patient(s) is discharged from the
Hospital. The wishes of the patient shall be considered, where feasible, in selection of a substitute
practitioner.
Notwithstanding any other prov1s10ns of these Bylaws, no suspension or termination of temporary
privileges shall give rise to any right to a hearing or appeal. Any grant of temporary privileges to an
Applicant shall not be construed as constituting the provisional six month initial appointment provided for
in Article 4, Medical Staff Membership and Privileges, Section 4.04 Procedures for Appointment,
Subsection A. Appointment Authority and Term.
The granting of temporary privileges pursuant to this Article shall not be construed to confer upon the
Practitioner any rights of membership on the Medical Staff.

D. Emergency and Disaster Privileges
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Bylaws, in the case of an emergency, any Appointee shall be
permitted to do everything possible within the scope of that Appointee's license to save the life of or
prevent serious bodily harm to a patient, using every facility of the Hospital necessary, including calling

privileges granted to the Appointee. Disaster privileges will be granted in accordance with Medical Staff
Policy AD 100.63.

E. Lapse in Privileges: Interim Clinical Privileges
No Appointee shall exercise clinical privileges unless such exercise occurs during the term of a grant of
clinical privileges pursuant to these Bylaws, including a grant of interim clinical privileges as provided
herein. For good cause, the Medical Director and the President of the Medical Staff, upon request of the
Department Chairperson, may recommend that the Chief Operating Officer grant interim clinical
privileges for a period not to exceed six (6) months from the date of the recommendation to any
Appointee whose appointment and clinical privileges will expire pending action upon an Appointee's
application for reappointment or upon a recommendation regarding an Appointee's elevation from
provisional to full appointment. Interim privileges shall terminate immediately upon the approval or
denial by the Board of Commissioners of the Appointee's reappointment or elevation to full appointment.
Termination of interim clinical privileges shall not give rise to a right to a hearing or appeal under these
Bylaws. Approvals by the Board shall be retroactive to the date upon which a grant of interim clinical
privileges was effective. Unless otherwise indicated in writing, Appointee granted interim privileges shall
be permitted to exercise the same clinical privileges and to occupy the same staff category which was in
effect prior to the application for reappointment or during the provisional period, whichever shall apply.
Appointees receiving a grant of interim clinical privileges shall be bound by the provisions of these
Bylaws.

* Referred, as amended, to the Committee on Finance on July 10, 2007.
Gail Lutz, Executive Clerk for Public Policy for the Clerk of the Circuit Court, provided the members
with a brief overview of the transfers requested.
Commissioner Suffredin asked whether Ms. Lutz believed that additional transfers would be needed prior
to the end of fiscal year 2007.

2906

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31 , 2007
Ms. Lutz responded that because the Clerk's office must pay overtime in order to service the courts, she
could not guarantee that additional transfers of funds would not be requested prior to the end of the fiscal
year.
Commissioner Quigley was concerned with a portion of the transfer to pay for services rendered by
vendors who were continuing to work without the Board's approval of a contract or contract extension.
Chairman Daley inquired whether the $58,000 transfer to the 335-261 Account was to pay for the
Petronella contract.
Ms. Lutz stated that part of the $5 8,000 transfer was for the Petronella contract, and the rest was for other
arbitration costs.
Chairman Daley remarked that the Board had ended the practice of approving contracts for outside
lobbyists prior to the 2007 budget. He asked if any of the transfers requested were for lobbying services.
Turee Olsen, Associate Clerk for the Clerk of the Circuit Court, responded in the negative.
Commissioner Silvestri asked Ms. Lutz to provide further infonnation on the source accounts from which
the funds will be transferred.
Ms. Lutz explained that these transfers were coming from lapsed dollars, which resulted from resignations
and absenteeism.
Commissioner Steele asked for further information regarding overtime for the Clerk of the Circuit Court
in order to service the courts.
James Anderson, Executive Officer, Office of the Chief Judge, stated that there is clearly a need for
overtime for the Clerk of the Circuit Court. Although some overtime is impossible to eliminate, because
bond and night courts must remain open, there are ways to work with the Clerk of the Circuit Court to
minimize overtime hours. He added that this issue would be actively addressed between the two offices,
and that the commissioners would be apprised of the efforts made to reduce overtime.
Commissioner Schneider asked why obligations from fiscal year 2006 were being paid with fiscal year
2007 monies.
Joseph M. Fratto, Cook County Comptroller, explained the procedure used by the Office of the
Comptroller to close out the year. He stated that the close out date for a given fiscal year is chosen and
communicated to all departments and elected officials. Although he was not Comptroller in fiscal year
2006, he believed that the close out date was January 31 , 2007. Prior to the close out date, departments
indicate whether open purchase orders and contracts should remain open. Direct pay items include
purchases of services or items that fall outside of the normal processes, and include legitimate authorized
purchases. If this occurs, there is no record of this item until the voucher comes to the Comptroller to be
paid, based upon the request at that time. If the requisition is received after the close out date for 2006, it
must be paid from 2007 monies.

2907

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2007

Ms. Lutz stated that she believed the requisitions for payment were submitted prior to the close out date
for fiscal year 2006.
Mr. Fratto stated that he would research the items in question to determine when they were submitted to
his office for payment.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Butler,
Communication No. 288055, as amended. The motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31 , 2007

Commissioner Beavers asked Chairman Daley if this Proposed Ordinance Amendment still contained the
section under which the Inspector General can investigate commissioners and their staff.
Chairman Daley responded affirmatively.
Commissioner Quigley requested information as to the reason why the outside legal opinion from Perkins
Coie, LLP was sought by the Office of the President. This opinion was made a part of the record of the
June 11 , 2007 Finance Committee Meeting.
Richard Velazquez, Special Counsel to the President, responded that there was no intent to set a precedent
by seeking this outside legal opinion, however the State's Attorney presented an opinion on this matter in
which they are a party at issue. Because of this, and because of the importance of the matter at hand, it
was believed that a legal opinion should be sought from an outside, independent party. He added that the
opinion was prepared by Ted Chung and Roseann Oliver from the law firm of Perkins Coie, LLP on a
pro-bono basis.
Chairman Daley added that if the Board should decide to solicit another independent legal opinion that
was not prepared on a pro-bono basis, the request for payment for this opinion, if over a certain dollar
amount, would be placed on the Board Agenda and referred to Commissioner Silvestri's Litigation
Subcommittee.
Commissioner Peraica asked Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State's Attorney and Chief of the Civil
Actions Bureau, whether the ordinance as presented violates the separation of powers provision of the
Illinois Constitution.
Mr. Driscoll replied that this issue may provide grounds for a party with standing to challenge the
ordinance as presented on the possible separation of powers violation.

THE COOK COUNTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
MITIGATION ACT (PROPOSED ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance
sponsored by Forrest Claypool, and Mike Quigley, County Commissioner~; Cosponsored by Elizabeth "Liz" Doody Gorman, Mike Quigley, Roberto Maldonado,
Anthony J. Peraica and Peter N. Silvestri, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

THE COOK COUNTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ACT
WHEREAS, the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) provides a means for governments
and firms to enter into a voluntary, legally binding agreement to reduce their emissions of
six greenhouse gasses by 1.2 percent each year from 2006 to 2010; and
WHEREAS, the CCX operates under a standard "cap-and-trade" system: each emitter is
allocated a certain number of credits and the number of credits is lowered each successive
year, allowing entities that reduce their emissions below their requirements to sell credits
and those that do not meet their requirements to purchase them; and
WHEREAS, many governments including the City of Chicago, King County,
Washington, and the State of Mexico as well as many Fortune 500 companies including
Ford, IBM, and DuPont have joined the CCX and committed themselves to reductions;
and
WHEREAS, Chicago reduced its direct greenhouse gas emissions by nearly nine percent
from its baseline (an average of between 1998 and 2001) and 2003 , a reduction of over

any air pollution site fee owed by the applicant has not been paid with in 60 days of the
due date, unless the applicant, at the time of application, pays to the Department in
advance the air pollution site fee for the site that is the subject of the operating permit,
plus any other air pollution site fees then owed by the applicant. The denial of an air
pollution operating permit for fai lure to pay an air pollution site fee shall be subject to

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31 , 2007

Your Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations of the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County met pursuant to notice on Wednesday, July 11 , 2007 at the hour of 1:30 P.M. in the
Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chainnan Suffredin stated that the Committee would not be hearing Communication Nos. 287601 and
287604.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
287201

CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER (APPOINTMENT). Transmitting a Communication
from Todd H. Stroger, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners.
I hereby appoint Dr. NANCY L. JONES as the new Chief Medical Examiner to replace
Dr. Edmund R. Donoghue.
I submit this communication for your advice and consent.
*Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans
Relations on 6/5/07.

Chairman Suffredin introduced Dr. Nancy L. Jones.
Dr. Jones presented her qualifications to the Committee, and briefly described her vision for the Office of
the Medical Examiner.
Chairman Suffredin asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

Christian Science-Committee on Publications

Commissioner Beavers asked Dr. Jones if she has experienced delays in test results or was dissatisfied
with the Illinois State Crime Laboratory 's service.
Dr. Jones replied in the negative, stating that the Office of the Medical Examiner receives timely results
from the Illinois State Crime Laboratory.
Commissioner Steele asked how the Office of the Medical Examiner can be utilized to educate in order to
deter unhealthy behaviors or to prevent death, particularly for youth.
Dr. Jones replied that the entire staff is more than willing to go to schools and other forums to speak about
the cases that come to the Office of the Medica l Examiner. For example, she stated that in the past,
homicide victims tended to be in the range of twenty-five to thirty years of age. However, over the years,
the victims have gradually become younger and younger. These types of cases can be used to educate
others on the consequences of unhealthy behavior and actions.
Commissioner Steele requested to receive a copy of the Dr. Jones' automation plan when it is completed.
Commissioner Sims expressed her support for Dr. Jones. She believed that Dr. Jones would run the
office effectively and treat the families and the Gift of Hope justly.

3018

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2007

Commissioner Peraica expressed his interest in receiving a multi-year plan for the Office of the Medical
Examiner that includes capital improvements, information technology and other improvements.
Chairman Suffredin asked Dr. Jones whether she was open to working out protocols for various burial
rites for people of diverse religious beliefs.
Dr. Jones responded that her office was very receptive towards learning and understanding the different
needs and requirements of burial rites.
Chairman Suffredin pointed out that if appointed, Dr. Jones would have three full-time job s: performing
autopsies, going to court and managing the Office of the Medical Examiner. He questioned how she
would be able to balance these responsibilities.
Dr. Jones replied that she would relinquish some of these duties, and stated that her main focus would be
the administration of the Office of the Medical Examiner.
Chairman Suffredin inquired whether Dr. Jones intends to utilize interns and student technicians to assist
in the workload at the morgue.
Dr. Jones replied that the idea of utilizing interns and student technicians is a part of her plan for the
office. There are pathology assistant students in the area whose educational requirements include forensic
experience. These types of students and interns can be utilized at no cost to the County for their
assistance.
Chairman Suffredin asked how the current budget, which is under $ 10 million, compares to the budget of
medical examiners in other jurisdictions.
Dr. Jones replied that in every j urisdiction, a common complaint is that there is inadequate funding for the
office.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved the approval of Communication
No. 287201. The motion carried.
287582

PRESIDENT, Todd H. Stroger, transmitting a Communication:

Chairman Suffredin introduced Ms. Susan J. White of Susan J. White and Associates, Inc.
Ms. White informed the members of her involvement in recent lobbying efforts on behalf of the County.
She indicated that there has been an emphasis on lobbying for Medicaid funding, and that she has been
working closely with Senator Durbin and the Illinoi s delegation.
Commissioner Daley asked Ms. White whether she believed that the County may find additional federal
funds for health care or public safety.
Ms. White stated that she does not foresee any new dollars, particularly as the current focus is on
preserving Medicaid funding. She added that public safety funding is also experiencing reductions.
Commissioner Claypool asked for further information on the procedure used by Congress to impose a
moratorium on the Bush Administration's rules, particularly the rule under which Medicare funding was
going to be greatly reduced.
Ms. White responded that the one-year moratorium on reductions to Medicaid funding was done on an
appropriations bill. She added that if the moratorium was not established, it would have cost Cook
County $235 million.
Commi ssioner Sims asked Ms. White whether the lllinois delegation was aware of the issue involving
intergovernmental transfers between the State and Cook County.
Ms. White responded affirmatively, and indicated that Senator Durbin was interested in assisting with the
resolution of this issue.
Commi ssioner Gorman asked Ms. White to elaborate on Congressman Tancredo 's amendment, in which
Homeland Security funding may be jeopardized if local governments pass "sanctuary county" resolutions
or do not actively enforce immigration laws. She also inquired whether Ms. White be lieved that this
amendment would pass in the Senate, as it has already passed in the House.

3020

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31 , 2007

Ms. White stated that Congressman Tancredo has offered this amendment every year. This amendment
states that local governments who provide "sanctuary" would not be eligible for some Homeland Security
dollars. She added that it is unlikely that the amendment will pass the Senate.
Commissioner Schneider asked whether the County was legally liable to provide health care to the
indigent.
Ms. White was unsure, however she did state that several years ago, the National Association of Counties
surveyed each state's Attorney General on this question. The results of the survey found that Attorney
Generals from thirty-eight states believed that the counties were legally liable. She was unsure whether
Illinois was included in the survey.
Chairman Suffredin pointed out that Commissioner Goslin had recently requested an opinion on this
subject from the State 's Attorney, and was awaiting a response.
Commissioner Schneider asked how Ms. White' s lobbying services differ from and complement lobbying
services received by the County from Richard Boykin of Barnes and Thornburg in Washington, D.C.
Ms. White stated that she has known Mr. Boykin for many years. While they work on different issues on
behalf of the County, they coordinate many of the meetings held with the Illinois delegation in
Washington , D.C. She added that her efforts have been mainly focused upon health care and Medicaid
funding.
Chairman Suffredin informed the Committee members that a report listing all of Ms. White 's and Mr.
Boykin 's legislative activities for the first six months of this year will be released next week, according to
the President's office.
Commissioner Steele asked if the Illinois delegation had confidence in the Bureau of Health Services
ability to resolve issues and overcome the difficulties it faces.
Ms. White stated that they had concerns, especially in the early part of the year. However, she believes
they are beginning to understand the issues and difficulties faced by the Bureau, and they see the efforts
being made to address these issues. She added that she feels there is a willingness to help.
Commissioner Moreno inquired whether Ms. White believed that the County might persuade the federal
government to loosen the rules under which Medicaid claims are filed, allowing the County to apply for
reimbursements for claims that have expired.
Ms. White was not certain, and replied that she believed it depends on how the state's Medicaid policy is
drafted.
Chairman Suffredin noted that in order to assist the County, Ms. White has taken a reduction in her rate
for this six month extension.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved the approval of Communication
No. 287582, as amended. The motion carried.

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE H-lB AND L-lB VISA FRAUD AND ABUSE
PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed
Resolution sponsored by Larry Suffredin and Roberto Maldonado, County
Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE H-lB AND L-lB VISA FRAUD
AND ABUSE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007
WHEREAS, the federal H-lB program was created to provide companies and
universities access to foreign workers in areas determined to be a "specialty occupation"
by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, but, instead, has become abused by
employers as a de-facto outsourcing program; and
WHEREAS, through the H-lB program, employers are not required to seek local talent,
thus blocking local white collar workers, including administrative and professional
positions, from competing for these job openings; and
WHEREAS, thousands of American white collar workers have been laid off and their
jobs offered to H-lB visa holders, many in the technology sector, the backbone of the
new information economy; and
WHEREAS, the Information Technology ("IT") sector has lost hundreds of thousands
of jobs since the recession of 2001 and not only has failed to replace those jobs, but also
continues to severely under-represent women and minorities; and
WHEREAS, more than half of the IT jobs filled under the FY 2005 H-lB program were
designated as entry-level white collar positions; and
WHEREAS, the H-lB program further accelerates the race to the bottom for white
collar workers by allowing employers to offer lower wages and impose other unfair labor
practices by making the H-lB visa holder beholden to their employer and holding the
threat of deportation over his or her head; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, between 2001 and 2005 over 180,000 white collar jobs
were put at risk, because of the H-lB program; and
WHEREAS, Senators Dick Durbin and Charles Grassley have introduced S. 1035, the
H-lB and L-lB Visa Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007 to reform the H-lB hiring
program by requiring employers to recruit from the U.S. workforce first, attest that the
H-lB visa holder will not displace an American worker and require that companies
advertise job openings for 30 days on the Department of Labor website before resorting
to the H-lB program.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby support S. 1035 and urges the United States Congress to
pass the measure and President Bush to sign it; and

3022

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2007

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered to
the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Majority
Leader of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives and all members
of Congress representing Cook County.

Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations on 6/19/07.

Chairman Suffredin introduced Jim Reilly, Chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority, and
provided the members of the Committee with the most recent newsletter published by the Authority.
(The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Mr. Reilly informed the members of recent developments with regard to funding issues and pending
legislation that impacts the Regional Transportation Authority.
Commissioner Gorman asked what specific legislative action the Committee was supporting in this
resolution .
Chairman Suffredin explained that Senate Bill 572 is the vehicle that will be used to provide additional
funds and to make the necessary changes to the Regional Transportation Authority Act. He stated that
there are a number of amendments that have not yet been presented, however he has given the Committee
members a summary of those that have been presented. These include amendments that contain a
formula that increases the sales tax by one-quarter cent in Cook County and the collar counties in which
the Regional Transportation Authority operates; these amendments also include a transfer tax in the City
of Chicago. He stressed the importance of the language in the resolution which indicates the need for
"full funding," which will allow for effective management and operation of these transit agencies.
Commissioner Claypool asked whether this bill addresses only operating funding or whether it includes
funding for capital improvements.
Mr. Reilly indicated that the Authority needs both types of funding, however Senate Bill 572 deals strictly
with operating funding. However, he stated that a bill might emerge later in the session that addresses
capital improvements.
Commissioner Schneider was concerned with the ambiguity related to the funding mechanism.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the decision needs to be made by the General Assembly, but added that the
County Board wants to encourage them to make a decision.
Commissioner Beavers asked if federal funding opportunities for capital improvements exist, and whether
the Regional Transportation Authority pursues these opportunities.
Mr. Reilly responded affirmatively, stating that they did very well when the federal capital bill passed two
years ago. The problem is that the Authority needs additional state capital funding in order to draw down
the federal funds to which they are entitled.
Leave was granted to add all commissioners as co-sponsors of Communication No. 287603.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved the approval of Communication
No. 287603. The motion carried.

and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

under his command had systematically tortured scores of African-American citizens at
Area 2 and 3 police headquarters; and

consumed over four years and cost the taxpayers of Cook County approximately $7

Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
288050

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION, by Raymond Muldoon, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated June 15, 2007:
requesting authorization from the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that certain
parcels of real estate owned by the County of Cook located at the Oak Forest Hospital of
Cook County Campus, 15900 South Cicero Avenue, Oak Forest, Illinois be declared
excess, be made available for sale, and sold at no less than the current fair market value
determined by a certified appraisal.
The subject property is comprised of the real estate located south of the campus on Cicero
A venue, and the area located east of the campus and including the lake and cemetery
areas, but not the campus itself.
It has been determined by all agencies involved that the subject property is no longer
needed for County purposes and can be released for sale.
Approval recommended.

*Referred to the Real Estate & Business & Economic Development Subcommittee
on July 10, 2007.

Anna Ashcraft, Special Assistant, Office of the President, gave a presentation on the property located at
15900 South Cicero Avenue, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County Campus, Oak Forest, Illinois. Ms.
Ashcraft recommended that the property be made available for sale, and sold at no less than the current
fair market value determined by a certified appraisal. The Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County Campus
was acquired in 1908 by the Cook County Board. Prior to this purchase of the property the facility was
used for feeding and housing the poor. It was a self-sustaining work farm and hospital community named
Dunning, located at 6400 West Irving Road (Irving Park and Nagle in the City of Chicago). The Cicero
parcel is a valuable 24 acres and has the potential for commercial development.
The City of Oak Forest would annex the parcel if the County of Cook would allow for a large commercial
development such as a " big box" store. The Forest Preserve District is willing to commit approximately
13 million dollars to purchase the land and care for the grave sites.

In the I 900 ' s the County Board decided to replace the facility and advertise for bids and selected the
property located at a l 59th and Cicero Avenue. The purchase cost was $33 ,625.00 for over 300 acres of
land.
Ray Muldoon, Director of the Real Estate Management Division, stated in the month of May a Request
for Qualification (RFQ) and Request for Proposal (RFP) were sent out for an appraiser and a surveyor.
The Real Estate Management Division selected two appraisers, Byrnes, Houlihan & Walsh, LLC and
SAS Appraisals, and survey company Claussen & White.

3036

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2007
Commissioner Murphy asked whether the State of Illinois is purchasing the 60 acres located on Crawford
Avenue.
Ms. Ashcraft replied the State of Illinois is interested in a minimum of 8 acres, but may be interested in
purchasing 60 acres.
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Chairman Goslin, moved the approval of Communication No.
288050. The motion carried unanimously.

3038

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2007

WHEREAS, the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance contains a number of
findings by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, including the following: l) that in certain areas of
Cook County there is a lack of viable industrial buildings which contribute to substantial unemployment
in such areas; 2) that if existing industrial structures were improved and utilized fully, and if new
industrial structures were developed, the County 's economic well-being would be improved by an
increase in the level of economic activity, by increased employment opportunities and by a growth in the
real property tax base; and 3) that the creation of new property tax classifications for new development of
industrial structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing industrial structures, for
the County as a whole, is an appropriate and necessary method of providing such assistance and
encouragement, and will result in increasing the tax base for the entire County; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance provides for a Class
6b development incentive, and corresponding reduced assessment level of 16% of market value, which is
available for real estate used primarily for industrial purposes where existing industrial structures have
been improved, more fully utilized, or where new industrial structures have been developed; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance currently defines
"real estate used for industrial purposes" to mean any real estate used primarily in manufacturing, as
defined, or in the extraction or processing of raw materials unserviceable in their natural state to create
new physical products or materials, or in the processing of materials for recycling, or in the transportation
or storage of raw materials or finished physical goods in the wholesale distribution of such materials or
goods for sale or leasing; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance currently defines
"manufacturing" to mean the material staging and production of goods used in procedures commonly
regarded as manufacturing, processing, fabrication, or assembling which changes existing materials into
new shapes, new qualities, or new combinations and including research and development associated with
the production of goods; and
WHEREAS, the definition of real estate used/or industrial purposes and the definition of manufacturing
were first defined in the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance by amendment
on May 19, 1986 and said definitions have remained the same since that time, except for an amendment
on November 23, 1999 that expanded the definitions by adding the current language regarding the
"processing of materials for recyc ling" as well the c urrent language regarding "research and development
associated with the production of goods"; and
WHEREAS, a number of businesses have put forth the proposition to use real estate to create and build
high-technology enterprises, commonly referred to as "Data Centers" or " Data Farms", which facilities
are a minimum of 100,000 square feet and are used to store large amounts of electronic data and
information on computers, computer servers, communications equipment and other electronic equipment;
and
WHEREAS, the real estate used for the Data Centers and Data Farms includes real estate used to create a
data center and internet exchange service that offers co-location, traffic exchange, peering and
outsourcing of information technology infrastructure, all of which allow for direct access to a large
number of network providers giving the user a secure, fault-tolerant, redundant internet infrastructure to
be used in the management and control of the user's own network and internet operations; and
WHEREAS, businesses have inquired whether Data Centers and Data Farms would qualify under the
Class 6b development incentive provided for by the Cook County Real Property Assessment
Classification Ordinance; and

3039

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31 , 2007

WHEREAS, Data Centers and Data Farms are a recent creation and did not exist in 1986 when the
definitions of "real estate used for industrial purposes" and "manufacturing" were first adopted; and
WHEREAS, the use of real estate to support Data Centers or Data Farms is the type of use that provides
an increase in the level of economic activity as well as an increase in employment opportunities and
growth in the real property tax base, all of which contributes to the County's economic well-being,
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners believes that the use of real estate by Data
Centers and Data Farms is the type of use of real estate that should qualify for the Class 6b development
incentive offered through the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, other industries have changed and evolved over the past twenty years due to the creation of
new computer and internet technologies as well as information technologies that did not exist when the
current definitions regarding industrial use were last drafted for the Cook County Real Property
Assessment Classification Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, there may exist some ambiguity as to whether the use of real estate to support other types of
businesses engaged in the creation of computer and internet technology as well as information technology
and products qualifies as the type of use to support a Class 6b industrial development incentive pursuant
to the Cook County Assessment Classification Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board recognizes that such ambiguity may cause h i-tech business entities
to forego development of their operations in Cook County thereby adversely impacting the economic
well-being of the County through a decrease in the level of economic activity, a decrease in employment
opportunities and a stagnation of the real property tax base; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board desires to promote the use of real estate to support business entities
engaged in hi-tech industry such as those that create computer and internet technology as well as
information technology and products in order that the County remain economically competitive and to
promote and aid in the creation of hi-tech employment opportunities; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board has determined that there is a need to review and amend the Cook
County Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance to clarify that real estate used for industrial
purposes includes use by business entities engaged in the creation of computer and internet technology as
well as information technology and products.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that:

Section 1. The above referenced recitals are hereby incorporated into this Resolution.
Section 2. The use of real estate in Cook County to support Data Farms or Data Centers should
be considered real estate used for industrial purposes pursuant to the Cook County Real Property
Assessment Classification Ordinance and as such is the type of use that generally qualifies for a Class 6b
development incentive pursuant to that ordinance.

such impacts will require a reduction of global warming emissions to 80 percent below current levels by
the year 2050; and
WHEREAS, currently the United States is responsible for producing approximately 25 percent of the
world's global wanning pollutants; and
WHEREAS, many leading U.S. companies that have adopted greenhouse gas reduction programs to

WHEREAS, state, regional and local governments throughout the United States are adopting emissions
reduction targets and programs, and this effort is bipartisan, coming from Republican and Democratic
leadership; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed the U. S. Mayors Climate Protection

term economic gains of energy efficiency to the long-term climate stabilization that can prevent
irreparable harm from catastrophic climate change impacts; and
WHEREAS, many counties throughout the nation, both large and small, are reducing global warming
pollutants through programs that provide economic and quality of life benefits such as reducing energy
bills, preserving green space, implementing better land use policies, improving air quality, promoting
waste-to-energy programs, expanding transportation and work choices to reduce traffic congestion, and
fostering more economic development and job creation through energy conservation and new
technologies.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners will take immediate
steps to help the federal, state, and local governments within our county to achieve the 2050 climate

every five years thereafter through 2050.
iii. Urge Congress and the Administration to enact a multi-sector national program of requirements,
market-based limits, and incentives for reducing GHG emissions to 80 percent below current levels by
2050. Urge Congress and the Administration to strengthen standards by enacting legislation such as a

SUPPORTING THE REVISION OF SENATE BILL 13 TO PROVIDE
REAL PROPERTY TAX PROTECTION FOR COOK COUNTY HOMEOWNERS
WHEREAS, a large number of homeowners in Cook County are overburdened by the overwhelming
increases in property value, as evidenced most particularly in the last three triennial reassessments; and
WHEREAS, due to the ever-increasing property tax burden, many long time residents are unable to
remain in the prospering neighborhoods they helped to create; and
WHEREAS, the triennial reassessment cycle makes it difficult for Cook County homeowners to predict
and financially prepare for the impact of three years worth of property value increases each reassessment
period; and

3054

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2007

WHEREAS, many residents in gentrifying neighborhoods are so burdened by property taxes that they are
forced to lobby against neighborhood improvements, fearing the subsequent increases in their tax bills;
and
WHEREAS, increases in the median income of Cook County residents has not kept pace with the
dramatic increases in property values; and
WHEREAS, the overall burden of property taxes has steadily been shifting more and more onto owners
of residential properties; and
WHEREAS, the continuation of the Expanded Homeowner Exemption which, in effect, caps assessment
increases at 7% annually would continue to provide Cook County homeowners with predictability and
affordability, while also providing protection to our neighborhoods, encouraging diversity and stability;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners strongly feels that this important form of
property tax relief should be made permanent until education funding reform is addressed by the State
Legislature; and
WHEREAS, Senate Bill 13 which is being considered by the State Legislature and the Governor
provides insignificant protection in the second and third triennial years for each district in Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County homeowners may expect median tax bill increases as great at 40% if Senate
Bill 13 is adopted; and
WHEREAS, this legislation gives Cook County homeowners a false sense of hope that similar protection
to what they received from the Expanded Homeowner Exemption in 2004 will be provided in Senate Bill
13;and
WHEREAS, there has been no movement for real property tax reforms so necessary for both Cook
County and the State of Illinois in this legislative session.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board does call upon the Governor
of the State of Illinois, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Illinois Senate
and the entire leadership of the Illinois Legislature to prioritize revisiting Senate Bill 13 to remedy the
insignificant amount of protection provided by this legislation for the second and third years of the
triennial reassessments beginning with Cook County's 2006 Chicago triennial reassessment, the 2007
North Suburban triennial reassessment and the 2008 South Suburban triennial reassessment; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners do
hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly and the Governor to make the 7% limitation on the increase in
taxable value of a homeowner's property permanent once the necessary changes to Senate Bill 13 are
adopted; and

RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL
MANAGEMENT'S DECISION TO ALLOW FOR INCREASED DUMPING
INTO LAKE MICHIGAN BY BP
WHEREAS, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) has granted a permit to BP
that will allow its Whiting, Indiana, refinery to discharge 54 percent more ammonia and 35 percent more
fine-particle pollution and solid waste into Lake Michigan; and
WHEREAS, as a result of this permit BP will be allowed to discharge 1,500 pounds of ammonia and
5,000 pounds of toxic sludge containing concentrated heavy metals daily into Lake Michigan; and
WHEREAS, the Clean Water Act, the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and several policing
agencies have been able to prevent and monitor increased dumping into Lake Michigan; and
WHEREAS, if the decision to allow increased dumping is upheld, this case will set a terrible precedent
that other companies will seek to follow; and
WHEREAS, IDEM will also permit BP to create Lake Michigan's first ' mixing
zone', a formerly banned practice in which refineries can directly discharge their waste into Lake
Michigan, thereby diluting it in lake water to claim the discharged water is clean; and

3056

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 31, 2007
WHEREAS, the site of the increased discharge at BP's Whiting, Indiana, refinery is located just three
miles from Chicago's south suburbs directly affecting the residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Lake Michigan serves as a vital resource for millions of Cook County residents as it
provides drinking water and beach recreation; and
WHEREAS, the vast quantities of ammonia being discharged will raise level s of nitrogen that will
significantly increase the incidence of fish-killing algae blooms; and
WHEREAS, increased pollution will affect Lake Michigan's shoreline, which serves as a vital, natural
corridor for many migratory bird species.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the Cook County Board of Commissioners,
gathered here this 31st Day of July, 2007, do hereby call on the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management to reverse its decision to award BP's Whiting, Indiana, refinery these special permits; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we hereby petition the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and Congress to intervene to protect and restore Lake Michigan; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be prepared and presented to the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the
Illinois congressional delegation.

Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TODD H. STROGER, PRESIDENT
AND JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
URGING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE ILLINOIS STA TE GOVERNMENT TO
RETROACTIVELY EXTEND THE PERIOD FOR THE COOK COUNTY
BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES TO COLLECT PAST DUE MEDICAID BILLS
WHEREAS, Cook County was faced with an historic budget deficit for fiscal year 2007 and again will
face a challenging budget process for fiscal year 2008; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services provides health care services to men, women
and children of all races, ethnicities, and religions, regardless of ability to pay; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services is often the only provider of health care
services to these patients and serves as a regional medical safety net for those without other options; and
WHEREAS, it is absolutely necessary for the Bureau of Health Services to collect all available Medicaid
dollars owed to the Bureau to ensure that the Bureau can remain a healthcare safety net option for the
uninsured and the underinsured; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services has recently uncovered a significant number of
unbilled Medicaid claims dating back to January 2006; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services has already provided the medical services
associated with these Medicaid bills; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services has been working closely and cooperatively
with the State of Illinois over the past six months, the time period to submit the vast majority of these
claims for reimbursement has expired; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services is in the process of restructuring, reviewing and
improving its bill collection process; and
WHEREAS, an extension of the time period for the Cook County Bureau of Health Services to collect its
past due Medicaid bills would be an enormous help to Cook County and the Bureau of Health Serv ices to
continue providing health care, during this restructuring period, to the people with nowhere else to receive
care.
