Pursuant to the discussion concerning the Lieutenants Association’s request, Trustee Wright
requested that a checklist of the Pension Fund’s requirements and related timeframe for retirement
and application to the Fund for Pension benefits be complied and posted on the Fund’s web page.
As previously discussed, the disaster recovery brick-and-mortar location in Lombard, which has been
budgeted for shutdown in September, will have some costs for dismantlement. The cost of the
shutdown have not been budgeted. Such costs include takedown of workstations. The cost, shared
by five pension funds is approximately $3200. The Board, in mutual agreement, approves the
additional costs for the dismantling of the disaster recovery site.
The Fund received a letter from John Kubick, a disability recipient of this Fund. This is a member
who indicated he was too ill to travel to Chicago for a medical re-exam. Therefore an appointment
with a doctor in Michigan, near where he resides, was arranged, and the findings were inconclusive
and such physician requested an additional neuropsychological exam. The Board’s physician, Dr.
Orris, reviewed with Mr. Kubick’s internist, who confirmed a diagnosis of liver disease, but that he
could travel to Chicago. Based on Mr. Kubick’s doctor’s approval for travel an appointment was
made in Chicago for the neuropsychological exam. Mr. Kubick failed to keep the appointment,
without any notification, and the Fund was charged for the missed appointment. In March 2016, the
Board voted to suspend his disability payments until he would travel to Chicago and submit to an
IME. Mr. Kubick’s letter is now requesting for local examination in Michigan because of a medical
development. Dr. Orris reviewed the new medical development, which is of concern, but Mr. Kubik
is able to travel. The Board directed that the benefit remains suspended until such time Mr. Kubik
presents himself to the specialist in Chicago for an IME and testing, if required.
The Fund received a letter from Alexandra Holt of the Office of Budget and Management which
requests estimates of the City’s contributions to the Fund. Based on Public Act 99-0506, the
payments for the next five years are set and are not actuarially determined. A draft response to Ms.
Holt was provided and the Board agreed with the content of the draft response. In addition, Director
Tuczak discussed the expected collections from the City for the remainder of 2016, noting that the
$420 million per Public Act 099-0506, will be offset proportionally be uncollected taxes that the City
does not receive. The estimate of such reserve is approximately $13 million.
Communication from the Senate Committee on Pension Investments is requesting a hearing with the
Fund, and others in the City and State of Illinois, on August 8 and 9, 2016. All Trustees are invited to
attend.

At the Board request, an RFP for insurance brokerage services, for the fiduciary liability, was drafted
and placed on the Fund’s website. In an effort to solicit responses the Executive Director went to
Chicago Crain’s list of the ten largest insurance brokers located in Chicago and sent them
solicitations. The only response was from Mesirow. It was mutually agreed to select Mesirow as the
Fund’s insurance broker for fiduciary liability.

THE BOARD RECESSED FOR LUNCH.
WHEREUPON, the following proceedings were had in open session.
The Fund has a member, Clay Walker, who is a duty disability applicant that was scheduled to be put on
the agenda last month for consideration of ordinary disability without prejudice. However, as the medical
report from the independent medical exam was not available by the meeting date, such application was
removed from the May agenda. When the June agenda was prepared this month, he was accidentally
omitted. The medical report was distributed for Board consideration.
After review of the independent medical evaluation it was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee
Lappe that the Board grant officer Walker subject to a full evidentiary hearing an ordinary disability
benefit without prejudice with the understanding that the Board reserves the right prior to such hearing
to revisit and terminate that benefit if it is deemed warranted.
