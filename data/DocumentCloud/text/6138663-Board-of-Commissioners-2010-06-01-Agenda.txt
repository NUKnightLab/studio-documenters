PRESIDENT
VETO
ITEM #1
RECEIVED AND FILED
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 24, 2010 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Please be advised, that in accordance with the authority granted to me by Section 2-6008 of the Counties
Code and for the reasons stated herein, I hereby veto New Item #5, as amended, passed by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on May 18, 2010 wherein the County Board mandated County Board
approval prior to adjusting a salary of a Grade 24 employee.
In accordance with Section 2-6008, I hereby transmit my veto of New Item #5, as amended and approved
on May 18, 2010 and request that this veto message be placed on the County Board Meeting Agenda for
the next meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, June 1, 2010.
New Item #5, as amended passed on May 18, 2010 by the Cook County Board of Commissioners. This
Ordinance requires County Board approval prior to adjusting the salary of a Grade 24 employee. This
Ordinance requires Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs or Department Heads to place a request to adjust the
salary of a Grade 24 employee, including the rational and justification for the request on the County
Board Agenda prior to implementing an adjustment; once on the Board Agenda, the matter can be taken
up for immediate consideration or may be referred to the Finance Committee for a hearing.
Requiring County Board approval prior to implementing a salary adjustment to a Grade 24 position,
whether said adjustment is an increase or decrease in salary, will inhibit the operations of the County
Board President and potentially the Offices of the separately Elected Officials. This May 18, 2010
Ordinance passed by the County Board is an attempt by the Legislative Branch to interfere with the
personnel operations of the Office of the President and the Offices of the separately Elected Officials and
will likely result in the pre-empting of employment by the County Board President.
This Ordinance further allows the County Board to refer to the Finance Committee requests from County
Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs and Department Heads to adjust the salary of a Grade 24 position.
Referring such requests for adjustment to the Finance Committee will slow the pace of County operations
will prevent the timely hire of an individual. The Ordinance also requires the County Board or Finance
Committee to approve or disapprove the request for adjustment, essentially putting the County Board in
the position to control the hiring of staff that is otherwise the statutory responsibility of the President.

VETO continued
ITEM #1 cont’d
This Ordinance interferes with the hiring authority of the President and is an attempt to control personnel
matters and the operations under the jurisdiction of the President and potentially the separately Elected
Officials.
The May 18, 2010 action by the County Board in passing New Item #5, as amended will result in a
burden on the operations of the County Board President, slow the pace of County government and
infringe on the President’s statutory right to hire. For this reason, I urge you to reconsider your support of
New Item #5, as amended.

In accordance with Resolution 10-R-03 adopted by the Cook County Board of Commissioners regarding
the adjustment of any Grade 24 positions, I am seeking approval of the Board to continue Sarah
Cochran’s position as Chief of Staff and salary as adjusted on January 4, 2010.
Sarah is currently working as Chief of Staff at a salary that is significantly lower than my former Chief of
Staff received and I have chosen not to fill the position that has been vacated by Sarah’s promotion. This
move will save taxpayers approximately $65,000.00 this year. I would appreciate any consideration you
may provide this request.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION REGARDING ADMINISTRATION OF THE
PRESIDENT’S OFFICE OF EMPLOYMENT TRAINING (POET)
WHEREAS, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) administers
federally funded workforce programs in Illinois through 26 Local Workforce Investment Areas
(LWIA’s); and
WHEREAS, one of these areas LWIA 7 located in south suburban Cook County is managed by the
President’s Office of Employment Training (POET) with the President being designated the Chief Elected
Official; and
WHEREAS, in June of 2005, DCEO placed LWIA 7, administered by POET, on “high risk” status due
to chronic fiscal and programmatic deficiencies and worked in conjunction with POET to resolve said
deficiencies; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois took these and subsequent measures after repeated warnings from the
U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) to resolve problems with POET or face federal penalties; and
WHEREAS, despite training, technical assistance and attempts to negotiate a voluntary transfer of
responsibilities for administering LWIA 7 to a third party, DCEO has reported that problems identified in
2005 have persisted; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #10 cont’d
WHEREAS, said problems have contributed to POET returning nearly $10 million of funds over the last
five years to DCEO, which were designated to assist unemployed and low income residents hampering
efforts by local agencies to deliver services to this population; and
WHEREAS, current funding levels should allow POET to serve at least 15,000 needy residents;
however, records indicate that fewer than 1,500 may be receiving services; and
WHEREAS, LWIA 8, the other local workforce investment area located in Cook County, which covers
the northern part of the county has been under the direct control of the State with the Governor designated
as the Chief Elected Official since their local administrator was decertified in 2004; and
WHEREAS, the State through DCEO is seeking to have a third party assume administration of fiscal and
programmatic duties for LWIA 7 to institute sound fiscal and programmatic structures as well as
consolidate LWIA 7 with LWIA 8 with the goal of ultimately transitioning the re-combined area back to
Cook County within a two year time frame; and
WHEREAS, the voluntary cooperation of the County’s administration during this transition will enable
the President to remain as the designated Chief Elected Official and consequently allow the County to be
in position to preside over and manage the newly re-organized and re-combined Local Workforce
Investment Area of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, failure to cooperate with the State’s plan will afford DCEO the power to reorganize under
powers granted to the Governor by federal law and also change designation of the Chief Elected Official
from the President to the Governor; and
WHEREAS, said scenario will also likely result in further returned monies as well as federal penalties.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby urge the President to accept the terms of the State of Illinois as presented through DCEO to reorganize POET through a designated third party and fully cooperate with said re-organization plan in
order to ensure that the combined workforce investment area will be transitioned back to Cook County
within the two year time frame.

Melinda Malecki
Risk Management is an essential area of specialized effort which focuses on reducing the types of
situations which may lead to litigation and liability. A good risk management program saves the County
and the System money by preventing incidents which increase costs in a variety of areas and by assisting
the facilities to comply with specialized regulatory and accreditation requirements. There are very few
staff currently assigned to perform risk management activities within the CCHHS affiliates; for example,
Stroger Hospital eliminated its department of risk management a few years ago and assigned limited risk
management functions (facilitating service of process and circulating discovery requests) upon the already
over-stretched quality assurance department. In response to this situation, the CCHHS hired this attorney
to establish an effective risk management program throughout the System and to direct the activities of
affiliates in this area. This individual is a highly qualified attorney with years of relevant experience who
has worked in, established and directed risk management programs in a number of Chicago area hospitals

CONTRACT
ITEM #19
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 5, 2010 from
MARK KILGALLON, Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of Administration
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Canon Business Solutions,
Lake Success, New York, for the leasing of 350 multifunction photocopiers on a cost per copy basis. All
County departments participate in the photocopier leasing program. The following offices will be
receiving equipment from this contract: Sheriff, Judiciary, Clerk of the Circuit Court, State's Attorney,
County Clerk, Assessor, Board of Review, Recorder of Deeds, and Offices under the President. All
equipment will be capable of network printing, faxing, and scanning. Cost per copy includes the use of
the equipment, maintenance services and all supplies (excluding paper). Request for Proposals (RFP)
were issued resulting in the submission of five (5) responses.
Reason:

Canon Business Solutions has been selected as the lowest cost qualified proposer based on the
Request for Proposals. Evaluation of the proposals was based on the following criteria: (1)
proposed cost per copy, (2) firm's experience and qualifications, (3) technical and equipment
information, (4) firm's installation and maintenance plan, (5) firm's billing and reporting
information, and (6) firm's ability to meet the MBE/WBE requirements of the County. The
equipment that will be replaced is currently provided by Canon Business Solutions.
It has been determined that leasing of multifunction photocopier equipment saves the County
an average of $900,000.00 annually versus purchasing and maintaining the same equipment.
Additionally, photocopier leasing contracts allow the County to keep up with technology by
replacing the equipment every five (5) years. Finally, multifunction photocopier equipment
allows departments to eliminate stand alone printers and fax machines which reduce capital,
maintenance, and supply costs.
This contract will replace the existing multifunction photocopier contract which will expire on
November 14, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,043,860.00 (FY 2010 - $50,000.00; FY 2011 - $608,772.00; FY 2012 $608,772.00; FY 2013 - $608,772.00; FY 2014 - $608,772.00; and FY 2015 - $558,772.00). Contract
period: November 15, 2010 through November 14, 2015. (490-630 and 499-630 Accounts). Requisition
No. 04900099.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 funds.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
