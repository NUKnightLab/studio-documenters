WHEREAS, the City of Chicago in the County of Cook confiscates more illegal guns per capita than

WHEREAS, studies have shown that universal background checks significantly reduce the number of

increase a shooter’s ability to fire the maximum number of rounds in a shorter amount of time, thus
increasing the likelihood of mass casualties or injuries; and

BOARD AGENDA

July 23, 2014

WHEREAS, a review of mass shootings by Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that when an assault
weapon or large capacity magazine was used it resulted in 135 percent more victims and 57 percent more
deaths, compared to other mass shooting; and
WHEREAS, requiring universal background checks and banning the sale of semi-automatic, military
style assault weapons and high capacity magazines would help to prevent dangerous or mentally unstable
individuals from obtaining deadly weapons; and
WHEREAS, the result of an advisory referendum would constitute the opinion of the residents of Cook
County on whether, in the State of Illinois, universal background checks should be required and
semi-automatic, military style assault weapons and high capacity magazines should be banned; and
WHEREAS, it is deemed to be in the public interest to submit this question of public policy to the voters of
Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, THAT:
Section 1. The following question of public policy shall be submitted to the voters of this county as an
advisory referendum in the general election scheduled for November 4, 2014, consistent with the
applicable provisions of the Illinois Election Code; to wit;
“Shall the Illinois General Assembly enact the Illinois Public Safety Act (Senate Bill 3659) which would
require universal background checks for firearm transfers and prohibit the sale and transfer of assault
weapons, assault weapon attachments and high capacity ammunition magazines?”
Section 2. This advisory referendum shall be conducted in accordance with provisions of the Illinois
Election Code pertaining to the conduct of the general election scheduled for November 4, 2014.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COOK COUNTY SPECIAL PURPOSE FUND REPORTING
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Cook County Annual Appropriation Bill, “special purpose funds are used to
account for the proceeds from special revenue sources, and the expenditures for specified or restricted
purposes”; and
WHEREAS, County expenditures from special purpose funds exceed $500 million on an annual basis;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County engaged McGladrey LLP to perform an audit of the FY2013 basic financial
statements; and
WHEREAS, the FY2013 Cook County audit affirms that expenditures from said funds must be specific
to an allowed purpose, and found a material weakness in the financial accounting and reporting relative
to certain special purpose funds; and
WHEREAS, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements
will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis; and
WHEREAS, the audit found that certain special revenue funds that receive resources that are restricted
to a special purpose do not have sufficiently detailed information in each individual fund’s general ledger
detail supporting expenditures; and
WHEREAS, without such information, there is not a sufficient audit trail to support that all expenditures
are specific to an allowed purpose; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has both a fiduciary and ethical duty to the
County taxpayers to ensure that all financial matters are in accordance with best accounting practices and
are fiscally responsible; and

direct that a report of all special purpose fund transactions with sufficiently detailed supporting
information as to the specifics of each transaction be made to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
by the Director of Budget & Management Services on a quarterly basis.

WHEREAS, Under MCCN, the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) accepts full
financial risk for the provision of health care services to CountyCare enrollees in return for a fixed
monthly payment for each enrollee; and
WHEREAS, Administration and effective management of a program like CountyCare and now Cook
County’s MCCN is extraordinary complex and requires processes and information that are fundamentally
different than those required for the System’s historical focus on patient care; and
WHEREAS, CCHHS has already created a senior management level committee with representatives
from Finance, Budget, Administration, Medical Staff, Ambulatory and Community Health Network, and
CountyCare staff; and
WHEREAS, this committee meets at least monthly and is coordinating its activities with the Cook
County Chief Financial Officer, Comptroller and Budget Director; and

Grantee: Cook County Government
Grantor: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region V
Request: Authorization to accept a supplemental grant
Purpose: The grant funds the following activities:
(1) Ambient air quality monitoring;
(2) Inspection of pollution sources for violations of state and federal environmental laws;
(3) Investigation of citizen complaints;
(4) Inspection and regulation of gas stations, dry cleaners and other facilities; and
(5) Submission of quarterly reports to the Illinois EPA

Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
Summary: This item asks for approval to renew the Department’s annual Fund 909 grant from the
USEPA’s Section 105 program. This grant funds the ambient air quality monitoring done at our Maywood
lab, the inspection of pollution sources for violations of state and federal environmental laws,
investigation of citizen complaints, inspection and regulation of gas stations, dry cleaners and other
facilities. This work is central to the Department’s mission and is reflected in a number of the Department’s
performance measures. Seven employees are funded as a part of this grant. In the past the department has
applied for and received this grant for a one year period. This however, has created difficulties with the
cash flow cycle. Often, we have not received the grant award until late in the grant period. This has
required the County to up-front the money for a longer period of time. In order to relieve this problem,

under the advisement of the USEPA, the Department applied in FY12 for a 2 year grant.
The 2 year grant is administered differently. Instead of one award, we receive several throughout the 2
year period (amounts and schedule are dependent on the federal budget approval schedule). This board
item is requesting approval in the amount of $532,064.00. The total 2 year grant will be for
$1,230,212.00 for two years.
This grant requires a 40% match, $246,537.06 on this award.

Total Amount of Transfer: $25,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 6/23/2014 it became apparent that account 259-222 would need additional funds to complete the rest
of FY14. The balance in the account on 6/23/2014 was $6,032.00, and the balance was the same 30 days
prior.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.

JOB ORDER CONTRACT
Department:

Office of Capital Planning and Policy

Summary:
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief
Procurement Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to
complete the (6) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows
facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a single,
competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected
contractors.
The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
generated contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with Maintenance, repairs,
replacement and routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore of any
work performed by the contractor is a contractor markup from the price book. The Gordian Group would
receive 5% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The
Gordian Group will manage the JOC process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant
with the terms and conditions outlined in the JOC contract within the County.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, proposes to assign the projects listed below to the Gordian
Group to share with participating JOC contractors.

BOARD AGENDA

July 23, 2014

Summary: The Bureau of Technology (BOT), in partnership with the Board of Review (BOR), is
requesting approval for BOR to enter into a three-year agreement with DataBank, LLC for the purpose of
reengineering and automating the BOR appeals process with the OnBase software. BOT will project
manage BOR’s technology implementation under this contract and support the application once
implementation is complete. Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with
the Cook County Procurement Code.
Currently, the BOR processes thousands of property tax complaints (appeals) per year. These complaints
have been gradually and significantly increasing as a result of the housing and economic crisis of the last
10 years. Thousands of complaints are filed in person at one of six locations (downtown and five
satellite locations). Though some technology is in use, the majority of the appeals are manually
processed. The challenges associated with manually processing thousands of paper files are significant,
and the simple task of searching and finding a file can be labor intensive.
Re-engineering the BOR’s current state and automating the reengineered processes through the
implementation of the OnBase software will allow the BOR to meet its objectives to simplify the online
filing process, reduce repetitive work, reduce human error, reduce cost associated with manual work and
paper printing, increase overall efficiency and increase transparency to management and the citizens of
Cook County
