PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NUCLEAR WASTE REPOSITORY
IN THE GREAT LAKES BASIN
WHEREAS, Ontario Power Generation (OPG) is proposing to construct a deep geologic repository
(DGR), which is an underground long-term burial facility, at the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station site in
Kincardine Ontario Canada, and bury and abandon in the DGR all of Ontario’s low and intermediate
level radioactive nuclear waste, some of which remains highly radioactive and toxic for over 100,000
years. The proposed site is approximately one kilometre inland from the shore of Lake Huron and about
400 metres below the lake level; and
WHEREAS, Ontario Power Generation did not consider or evaluate any other actual sites for the
location of the proposed DGR; and
WHEREAS, fresh water is the nation’s and Canada’s most important resource and should be protected
and managed prudently; and
WHEREAS, the Great Lakes are an irreplaceable natural resource, containing twenty one percent of the
worlds, and ninety five percent of North America’s fresh water, vital to human and environmental health
and economic and agricultural well-being of both Canada and the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron are hydrologically connected as one continuous water
body and any contamination resulting from a leaking nuclear waste repository located on Lake Huron
could affect Lake Michigan's waters, the source of drinking water for almost 7 million residents of 11
northeastern Illinois counties (Boone, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake,
McHenry and Will); and
WHEREAS, Lake Huron and connecting waters including Lake St. Clair, are a source of drinking water
for millions of people downstream in Canada, the United States of America and First Nations; and
WHEREAS, individuals, citizen and environmental groups and municipalities and counties in both
Canada and the United States have expressed concern and opposition to the proposed nuclear waste
repository; and
WHEREAS, as of September 22, 2014, one hundred thirty three (133) resolutions have been passed by
communities in the States of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio
and Indiana and in the Province of Ontario representing 11 million citizens opposing the proposed
nuclear waste repository, with the vast majority of the resolutions opposing any permanent underground
nuclear waste repository anywhere in the Great Lakes Basin; and

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

October 8, 2014

WHEREAS, the Michigan Senate has expressed serious concern for the failure of the siting process in
Ontario for the proposed OPG DGR to fully account for all potential impacts of the proposed facility by
passing a legislative package urging intervention by the Great Lakes Commission, the International Joint
Commission and a special legislatively created advisory board. SB 948, SCR 16, SCR 17, SR 150 and
SR 151 all have been passed unanimously by the Michigan Senate; and
WHEREAS, under the 2012 Protocol Amending the Agreement Between Canada and the United States
of America on Great Lakes Water Quality, the governments of Canada and the United States
acknowledge the importance of anticipating, preventing and responding to threats to the waters of the
Great Lakes; and
WHEREAS, the Governments of Canada and of the United States share a responsibility and an
obligation to protect the Great Lakes from contamination from various sources of pollution, including the
leakage of nuclear waste from an underground nuclear waste repository; and
WHEREAS, in September 2014 resolutions HR 716 and SR 565 have been introduced respectively in
the US House of Representatives and US Senate expressing the sense that (1) the Canadian Government
should not allow a permanent nuclear waste repository to be built within the Great Lakes Basin; (2) the
President and the Secretary of State should take appropriate action to work with the Canadian
Government to prevent a permanent nuclear waste repository from being built within the Great Lakes
Basin; and (3) the President and the Secretary of State should work together with their Canadian
Government counterparts on a safe and responsible solution for the long-term storage of nuclear waste;
and
WHEREAS, placing a permanent nuclear waste burial facility so close to the Great Lakes is ill-advised.
The potential damage to the Great Lakes from any leak or breach of radioactivity far outweighs any
suggested economic benefit that might be derived from burying radioactive nuclear waste at this site.
The ecology of the Great Lakes, valuable beyond measure to the health and economic well-being of the
entire region, should not be placed at risk by storing radioactive nuclear waste underground so close to
the shoreline.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that in order to protect the Great Lakes and its tributaries,
the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges that neither this proposed nuclear waste repository at
the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station site nor any other underground nuclear waste repository be
constructed in the Great Lakes Basin, in Canada, the United States, or any First Nation property; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges the
Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario to reject (and seek alternatives to) Ontario Power
Generation’s proposal to bury and abandon radioactive nuclear waste in the Great Lakes Basin; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted to Ontario Premier
Kathleen Wynne, Canada’s Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Canada’s Federal Minister of the Environment
Leona Aglukkaq, President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of
the United States House of Representatives, the members of U.S. Congress representing Cook County, the
Governor of the State of Illinois, the Attorney General of the State of Illinois, members of the Illinois House
and Senate representing Cook County, northeastern Illinois county boards of Boone, DeKalb, DuPage,
Grundy, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will, all Members of Ontario’s Provincial

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SPACE STANDARDS ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 2,
ADMINISTRATION, Article XII, Asset Management, Division 1, Sections 2-1000 through 2-1025, is
hereby enacted as follows:
Chapter 2, ADMINISTRATION, Article 12, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SPACE STANDARDS
Sec. 2-1000. Legislative findings and purpose.
(a) Section 5/5 of the Counties Code (55 ILCS 5/5-1106) provides that “it shall be the duty of the county
board "to provide proper rooms and offices for the accommodation of the county board, State's attorney,

county clerk, county treasurer, recorder and sheriff . . . .
(b) In fulfilling that obligation, the County of Cook owns or occupies over 19 million square feet of real
estate assets.
(c) The County expends millions of dollars each year to operate those real estate assets.
(d) In addition to operating costs, hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred maintenance and capital
needs will be required to continue to operate County real estate, which will require constant capital
expenditures over many years.
(e) Efficient use of the County’s real estate assets could save the County millions of dollars in operating
and capital costs by facilitating consolidation of space into fewer facilities and reducing space needs for
many users.
(f) Efficient use of the County’s real estate assets requires a centralized and consistent approach, with
participation by various agencies and departments having knowledge and responsibilities bearing on the
use and maintenance of real estate, and cooperation among using departments and agencies in
modernizing space use.
(g) In order to promote efficient use of real estate assets, in 2011 the Real Estate Management Division,
the Office of Capital Planning and Policy, the Department of Facilities Management, the Budget and
Management Services Department, and the Bureau of Administration, under the authority of President
Toni Preckwinkle, created the Space Allocation Committee, charged which instituting processes and
procedures for departments and agencies requesting additional space or reconfiguration to existing space.
(h) The Space Allocation Committee has implemented a process for allocating real estate assets, and has
begun reallocating unused or underutilized space, with significant cooperation from many departments
and elected officials.
(i) In 2012, the County undertook a Real Estate Asset Strategic Realignment Plan project (the REASRP)
which has assessed both the physical condition and the space utilization of County real estate assets.
(j) The REASRP recommends re-structuring the management of real estate assets by combining the
departments of Capital Planning, Facilities Management and Real Estate into one group, under the
leadership of an Asset Manager.
(k) The REASRP has revealed that administrative and other space is often underutilized, based upon
modern office standards, whereas other agencies and departments operate in cramped and therefore
inefficient space which hampers the delivery of public services.
(l) The REASRP has developed Office Standards and procedures for applying those standards, which, if
fully implemented, could reduce administrative occupancy by over 300,000 square feet, as well as data
on employee counts and uses of space which will enable the Space Allocation Committee to analyze
space needs and promote fair and efficient use.

Page 37 of 62

BOARD AGENDA

October 8, 2014

(m) The data generated by the REASRP requires continuous updating in order to support efficient space
allocations, which can only be accomplished through cooperation and open exchange of information
regarding space use between the Space Allocation Committee and Elected Officials.
(n) The purpose of this article is to:
(1) Establish an Asset Management Steering Committee in order to achieve the goals of the REASRP
and implement its recommendations, to provide for participation by Elected Officials and to foster

the authority to assign, allocate, or change the use of space in any County facility or in or on any
County-owned or occupied real estate other than by participating in the process established and
administered by the Space Allocation Committee.
(e) SAC has the authority to make and deny allocations of space, changes to space use, renovations,
reductions of space, and all other changes affecting the use of real estate assets; to develop and
implement standards for space use, apply such standards to space requests and existing uses, investigate
existing space uses and re-allocate space that is determined to be underutilized, prioritize space needs,
develop and implement policies and procedures regarding the use and allocation of real estate assets,
approve and deny furniture procurements not in accordance with the Furniture and Finishes Standards,
and take other actions as necessary to optimize the County’s use and expenditures for its real estate
assets. SAC will report to AMSC on progress in the space allocation process, on issues requiring policy
decisions, and on progress in consolidation and efficient asset management.
(f) All Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs, department heads and other County employees or officials for
whom the County provides real estate in which to conduct County business, will be required to cooperate
with the SAC space allocation process in making any alterations, improvements, reconfiguration or other
changes to space or to use of space, expanding or reducing occupancy of space, relocating staff within or
between facilities, reallocating existing space among departments of the using agency, and procurement
of furniture, regardless of source of funding.
(g) Due to the cost of operating and maintaining real estate assets, all Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs,
department heads and other County officials or employees for whom the County provides real estate will
notify the SAC of any vacated space in order that such space can be re-purposed.
(h) Upon request, Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs, department heads and other County officials will

will occur over a number of years. Therefore, SAC will endeavor to adhere to the Office Space Standards

Page 40 of 62

BOARD AGENDA

October 8, 2014

as much as practicable in all requests for space and reconfiguration, while balancing the costs to achieve
the goals with other factors such as the length of time the space will be occupied, the eventual plan for
the facility in which it is located and similar factors.
(c) The implementation of the Office Space Standards depends in large part on procurement of
appropriate sizes and configurations of modular and other office furniture, fixtures and certain office
equipment such as printers and similar devices that impact space use (Furniture and Fixtures). In
addition, in order to provide flexibility in re-purposing of space, fairness and a consistent and productive
office environment, it is important to apply standards to the design and allocation of Furniture and
Fixtures. Therefore, SAC is further charged with the development of furniture, fixtures, equipment and
finishes standards (Furniture and Finishes Standards), and the application of such standards. The Chief
Procurement Officer shall provide to SAC copies of all procurement requests involving Furniture and
Fixtures and using departments shall cooperate with SAC in conforming purchases to the Furniture and
Finishes Standards. Orders for items covered by the Furniture and Finishes Standards will not be placed
without concurrence from the SAC Chair.
(d) The implementation of the Office Space Standards is also impacted by the use and adoption of
technology, such as printing and multifunctional devices, broadband availability, and network
connectivity. Therefore, the Bureau of Technology will collaborate with SAC to promote efficient use of
technology to minimize space use, and to adopt standards and procedures for the distribution and use of
such technology so as to improve the efficiency of space utilization. As technology is adopted, and as
space use and standards evolve, the Bureau of Technology will cooperate with SAC to review the Office
Space Standards from time to time and adopt modifications as appropriate to enhance space utilization
and cost effectiveness.
(e) The provision of adequate conference rooms and maximizing use of conference rooms are critical
elements in the efficient use of space. Therefore, SAC is further charged with developing procedures for
sharing and scheduling of conference facilities accommodating more than 10 individuals.
Sec. 2-1005. Procedures
SAC shall develop procedures for efficient use of space and for submitting, evaluating and deciding upon
requests for space, requests for changes, procurement and installation of furniture, and other actions
regarding or impacting space use, space efficiency, and improvements.
Sec. 2-1006 through 1025. Reserved.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Office of the State’s Attorney
Request: requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer $90,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below.
Reason: This transfer of funds, which represents less than one-tenth of one percent of our 2014 budget,
should be sufficient to fulfill our obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year for two accounts with
projected shortages. These accounts are: 250-217 Transportation for Specific Activities, where we have seen

Page 58 of 62

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

October 8, 2014

higher than anticipated costs for bringing in witnesses from out of state and for relocating witnesses for their
protection; and 250-246 Micro Filming (photocopying) of Records, where we have experienced a significant
increase in costs for obtaining medical records of adult and juvenile victims.

From Account(s): 250-355, $35,000.00; 250-445, $55,000.00
To Account(s): 250-217, $50,000.00; 250-246, $40,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $90,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On August 1st, Account 217 had a balance of approximately $50,000; on July 1st, the balance was
approximately $160,000.
On August 1st, Account 246 had a balance of approximately $5,000; on July 1st, the balance was
approximately $21,000.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
These were the accounts, based on current year to date spending and known obligations, which were
projected as most likely to have remaining balances at year end.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Although spending fluctuates from year to year in many accounts, our original budget requests were
based on our best projections at that time.
