(Item A1)
The resolution for Item A1 approves the option to extend contract with Aon Risk Services
Central for Brokerage and Consultant Services for the Private Managers Insurance Program
(PMIP). Participation in this program is still mandated by contract for all Private Managers
(PM). The costs associated with the PMIP (insurance premiums, claim costs and administration
fees for both broker and claims) are included in the operating budgets for each PM. During the
last four years, Aon has aggressively marketed both insurance programs starting with holding an
informational session at the Authority with prospective carriers and taking carriers on a tour of
various locations.
Aon conducted an in depth analysis of all coverage and made
recommendations that resulted in coverage enhancements at no additional cost and procurement
of additional lines of coverage. Aon’s efforts resulted in CHA receiving optimum insurance
coverage, while realizing cost savings for the CHA and the PMIP, and obtaining competitive
bids for various lines of coverage.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-153
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated November 10,
2009, entitled, “Authorization to Exercise the Option to Extend Contract No. 6006
with Aon Risk Services Central, Inc. for Brokerage and Consultant Services to the
CHA and for the Private Managers Insurance Program (PMIP)”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute an amendment exercising the third year option of Contract
No. 6006 (the “Contract”) with Aon Risk Services Central, Inc. (“Aon”) for the
period of January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010 for an amount of
$284,614.00 to continue providing brokerage and consultant services to the CHA
and for the Private Managers Insurance Program. The Contract’s new total
compensation amount will be $1,332,520.00.

(Item A2)
On June 2009, the CHA advertised a Request for Proposal (RFP) in area newspapers soliciting
proposals for a Centralized Storage Solution. The proposal was sent to thirty vendors and fortyfour Assist Agencies. All six proposals received were deemed responsive and were given to the
evaluation committee for their review. Based on the recommendation of the Evaluation
Committee, System Solutions, Inc. was determined to offer the best proposal that met the
technical requirements of the RFP and was found to provide the best overall value consistent
with CHA’s requirements for the Centralized Storage Solution. The CHA selected System
Solutions Inc. to provide a scalable Enterprise Network Storage System that will provide High
Availability and Manageability of CHA’s technical infrastructure. Storage Area Networks
provide the ability to successfully store, manage, backup, network, access consolidate, and
3

 secure CHA’s data. System Solutions Inc. is an information technology provider that offers
complete business solutions including enterprise solution architecture and storage area networks.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item A2 approves award of contract to System Solutions for a
centralized storage solution.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-154

2009, “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH SYSTEM
SOLUTIONS INC. FOR CENTRALIZED STORAGE SOLUTION UPGRADE
AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

The Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with System Solutions Inc. for the Centralized
Storage Solution Upgrade and Professional Services in the amount of
$1,562,105.68.

(Item A3)
In June of 2009 the Board of Commissioners authorized the creation of instrumentalities to
pursue funding opportunities from both federal and non-federal sources to provide strategic
means of advancing CHA’s mission and other factors of its long term strategic plans. In
preparation for potential engagements with prospective service partners under performancebased contract relationships, the CHA has commenced the formation of its affiliate, Chicago
Housing Consulting Services (CHCS). In anticipation of the issuance of a Request for Proposal
from HUD for contract administration, CHA advertised a Request for Proposal in area
newspapers and on the CHA website. Based on the recommendation of the evaluation team,
CGI Federal Inc.’s proposal was responsive and warranted pursuit of negotiations for potential
entry into a performance based contract. For over 15 years, CGI’s government Services and
Business Processes Division has been the partner for numerous housing agencies across the
country. CGI’s combination of experience with Section 8 HAP Contract Administration, IT
knowledge and understanding of HUD systems forms the foundation needed for successfully
administering Section 8 project-based contracts. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A3
authorizes management staff to pursue contract negotiations for Performance Based Contract
Administration.
RESOLUTION NO. 2009-CHA-155
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter dated November 10,
2009, entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO CHA MANAGEMENT AND STAFF
TO PURSUE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS FOR PERFORMANCE BASED
CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into negotiations with and authorizes the execution of a contract
with CGI Federal, Inc. to be a subcontractor for Chicago Housing Consulting
Services (CHCS), an affiliate of the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), to pursue
HUD’s HAP RFP for contract administration for project-based Section 8 HAP
contracts. Consistent with the requirements of Resolution No. 2009-CHA-82 and
the Significant Actions Policy, the CHA shall seek further approval from the
Board of Commissioners prior to the provision of services or performance of
activities pursuant to any award to CHCS from HUD under the HAP RFP.

(Item A4)
A Request for Proposal (RFP) for Financial Advisory Services was released in July 2009. The
RFP was advertised in area newspapers and on CHA’s website. Of the four proposals received,
three firms were asked to come in for oral presentations. Based upon the review of the
proposals, the information gathered in the oral presentations and the best and final offers, the
evaluation committee determined that David Paul Rosen & Associates (DRA) and KPMG
Corporate Finance LLC best met the Authority’s needs. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A4
approves award of contracts to DRA and KPMG to serve as financial advisors, on a project by
project basis. DRA is a nationwide leading expert on affordable housing finance and
4

 development, redevelopment, sustainable development, land use policy and finance. DRA has
comprehensive experience with HOPE VI, Low Income Housing Tax Credits and bond financing
expertise. KPMG member firms provide advisory, audit, and tax services to clients in more than
140 countries and employ over 100,000 people. Their infrastructure team focuses on the
financing and investment elements of infrastructure transactions and Public Private Partnership
(PPP) projects. KPMG as financial advisor assists public sector clients in the planning,
assessment, procurement, evaluation, negotiation, and implementation of PPP transactions,

creative strategies such as: home buyer incentives, developer promotions, dramatic price
reductions, promotion of the recent first time home buyer federal tax credit and other incentives.
The Find Your Place (FYP) program compliments prior strategies by promoting the sale of
homes in Plan for Transformation neighborhoods. CHA will provide one-time cash assistance to
home buyers in increments ranging from $10,000-$20,000, to encourage the sale of 50-100
market rate homeownership units. The incentive packages will cover a variety of costs
associated with purchasing a home (e.g. closing costs, down payment assistance, etc). CHA has

Partnership for New Communities in the FYP program since its inception in September 2008.

(Item B1)
In August 2009, the CHA advertised a Request for Proposal (RFP) in area newspapers and on
CHA’s website for an Environmental Consultant. The CHA also directly solicited 302 firms,
including 107 MBE/WBE/DBE firms and 44 assist agencies. The Evaluation Committee
reviewed and scored the 15 proposals received and determined that nine Respondents were
within the Competitive Range. Each of the nine firms made a presentation. Upon further

awarded contracts. Accordingly, the resolution for Item B1 approves award of contracts to:
Carnow, Conibear and Associates, Ltd., Camp, Dresser and McKee, Inc., Environmental Design

Office of Development Management will maintain one qualified vendor group in which all
vendors will submit a proposal to perform a scope of work provided by the CHA. The
7

 Environmental Consultants will submit proposals to perform the Task Order work on a Lump
Sum Basis. The CHA will then evaluate the proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in
Environmental Consultants’ contracts, select the successful respondent to perform the Task
Order work and issue a Notice to Proceed for the work. Performance on ongoing Task Order
assignments will be a factor in determining future awards of specific task orders. No firm is
guaranteed anything more than a minimum of $100,000.00. On an as-needed basis, the CHA’s
Contracting Officer may evaluate requests from Capital Construction and Development
Management to adjust the not-to-exceed values of well performing vendors. On an ongoing

resulting from contractors’ prolonged failure to competitively bid or be awarded Task Order
work.

In January 2000, the Board of Commissioners approved the Plan for Transformation, which upon
approval by HUD was incorporated into a Moving to Work (MTW) Agreement. Per the MTW,
the Authority is required to submit an Annual Plan to HUD outlining the steps the CHA will take
during the applicable fiscal year to achieve the goals and commitments of the Plan for

Extensions properties as part of the process of the revitalization of these developments. Per
HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 970.7, permission to demolish all or a portion of a federally

(Item B4)
The resolution for Item B4 approves B-M Maplewood, LLC as the selected developer for the
Maplewood Courts development site, enter into a Redevelopment and Pre-development Loan
Agreement and extend the transaction closing duration for M-M Maplewood LLC under the
CHA Housing For Chicagoans Everywhere (HCE) Program. The Developer presented
CHA/Habitat with a proposal for the redevelopment of Maplewood Courts, a vacant city state
property, with the intent to build approximately 84 mixed-income units; inclusive of up to 28
public housing units. The approved June 17, 2008, Board Resolution and the March 29, 2007,
RFQ current procurement limits state that pre-qualified Respondents have a two year period to
propose and close development transactions. Extenuating financial circumstances on the B-M
Maplewood transaction require the extension of the closing period beyond the allotted two year
period. This extension request would allow Brinshore and Michaels to close their HCE
development transactions within two years after signing the redevelopment agreements. The
proposed predevelopment loan will not exceed 75% of eligible third party predevelopment costs
consistent with HUD cost control guidelines and regulations. The loan will help fund a portion of

 the predevelopment costs for the Maplewood Courts redevelopment which include survey work,
architect and engineering design, planned development fees and building permits.

offices. The Committee was presented with an update on the Public Housing Museum and
Family Works Program.
Commissioner Young then introduced a Motion for adoption of Resolution for Item C1
discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services Committee.
(Item C1)
The CHA advertised a Request for Proposal soliciting vendors to provide case management
services through the FamilyWorks program. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers and the
CHA website. The CHA also directly solicited 70 firms, including 45 MBE/WBE/DBE firms
and 44 assist agencies. Of the 11 submittals received and evaluated, nine firms were found to be
in the competitive range. Based upon the evaluations of the written proposals, oral presentations,
and the best and final offers, it was determined that Centers for New Horizons, Employment &
Employee Services, Heartland Human Care Services, Jane Addams Hull House Association,
Metropolitan Family Services, and Uhlich Children’s Advantage Network will provide the best
overall service and value to CHA for the FamilyWorks program. Accordingly, the resolution for
Item C1 approves award of contracts to the named vendors to provide supportive services
10

 through the FamilyWorks Program. The FamilyWorks program has been designed to serve
families residing in CHA’s family developments, scattered site communities, and families that
relocated temporarily to the private housing market with a Housing Choice Voucher since
October 1999. FamilyWorks agencies work closely with CHA staff and property management to
facilitate efficient communication and coordination regarding resident needs. The FamilyWorks
program model addresses two important challenges facing CHA families: housing stability and
employment, and includes a clinical component to address mental health and disability issues
that often present themselves as barriers to stable housing and employment. The program model
utilizes identifiable outcomes with an intensive concentration on permanent housing choices,
lease compliance, employment preparation, and employment retention. In 2010, the selected
FamilyWorks agencies will develop liaison positions focused on youth and senior services. The
identified liaisons will assist in the coordination of services with and activities with CHA’s
Director of Youth Services and Director of Senior Support Services. FamilyWorks agencies will
also employ a Section 3 liaison to identify and screen resident candidates for training and
employment opportunities created by CHA contractors.

(Item C2)
The resolution for Item C2 approves the third one-year option of the Intergovernmental
Agreement with the Chicago Park District (CPD) for continued access to year round recreational
programs. Since 2002, CHA has partnered with CPD to jointly fund the provision of safe,
positive, and structured activities for CHA youth both during the school year and summer
months. The IGA has had a positive impact on thousands of CHA youth who otherwise may not
have been able to participate in CPD programs due to cost. In 2010, the IGA will allow CHA and
CPD to continue year round services at reduced costs to CHA families and the Counselors In
Training program will be expanded to serve 40 teens. Further, residents whose youth enroll in
the extended two-week day camp at summer’s end will be able to do so at a reduced cost.
