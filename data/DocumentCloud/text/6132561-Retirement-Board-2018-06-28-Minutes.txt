•

Ms. Tuczak reviewed with the Trustees the timeline for this year’s election for two trustee

represents patrolman, investigator or ranks equivalent thereto. The timeframe of the election
was discussed, including the sufficiency Board hearing in which a quorum must be present.
A sufficiency hearing date was tentatively scheduled for Friday – October 5, 2018, at 9:30am,
at which time all petitions for candidacy would be reviewed and the related ballot approved.

The next issue was a letter from the City of Chicago’ s Office of Budget and Management
requesting estimates for the tax levy for budget years 2019 through 2023. Ms. Tuczak
distributed a draft response letter to the Trustees for review, noting the amounts included in
the response were derived from the current actuary report, and in addition GRS, the Fund’s
actuarial firm, will be preparing a letter to accompany the Fund’s response.

•

The next item, Ms. Tuczak formally introduced Caroline Vullmahn, the Fund’s newly hired
Comptroller, to the Trustees. Ms. Tuczak requested that Ms. Vullmahn be added as a
signatory, as Comptroller, to the Northern Trust, the Fund’s custodial bank.
It was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Wright that the Board direct the

The next item concerns topics from Dr. Orris, the Board’s physician.

Dr. Orris relayed to the Trustees, that the Occupational Services Institute at the University of
Illinois (OSI at U of I), the department in which Dr. Orris works, contracts with and has consulted
with a variety of City, County agencies and State agencies over a period of time. In the past, the
Board has expressed concern that Dr. Orris not perform examinations for the City, as such may be
a conflict with his services to the Board of Trustees. Dr. Orris indicated that OSI at U of I has
two new relationships in which services may be performed for the Committee on Finance and/or
the CPD Medical Section. Dr. Orris indicated, and the Board of Trustees confirmed, that with
respect to these two new relationships, he will not perform any examinations for police officers,
to avoid any conflict of interest or confusion for the police officer.
Dr. Orris next discussed the matter of John Kubik, a member previously in receipt of duty
disability benefits. Mr. Kubik’s benefits were suspended awhile ago, when he did not travel to
Chicago for the required annual examination. Since that time documentation was provided
suggesting a limitation on travel by Mr. Kubik, and two independent medical exams were
conducted on Mr. Kubik closer to his residence. Dr. Orris discussed the results of such exams,
noting that based upon such new information, the member is presently unlikely to return to duty.
WHEREUPON, Trustees Caldero left the proceedings.

It was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Wright that the Board retroactively
reinstate Mr. Kubik’s duty disability benefits, with a medical re-exam scheduled for April 2019 and
results submitted to the Board by June 2019, to avoid suspension of benefits.

duty disability benefits, who has failed to attend her annual exam with Dr. Orris three times. Ms.
Tuczak reviewed with the Trustees the Board’s Policy concerning no-shows.
It was moved by Trustee Brown, seconded by Trustee Wodnicki that the Board suspend Elizabeth
Kerin’s duty disability benefits until she submits to a medical exam.

The last item from the Executive Director, Ms. Tuczak, was for informational purposes only.
Ms. Tuczak discussed procedures the Firemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
(FABF) is conducting with respect to receipt of tax levy collections. Ms. Tuczak noted that
collection of tax levy receipts has been previously discussed with the Trustees, noting the
Fund receives tax collections in a like manner to which the City collects such revenues, with
an uncollectible portion each year. FABF is investigating procedures to potentially audit the
uncollectible reserve. The Trustees indicated that they will await further updates on FABF
efforts.

Board counsel, David Kugler, reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

Recent legislation affecting previously denied purchases of prior service has passed both
houses, but is pending Governor signature. Mr. Kugler recommended that the Board send a
letter to the City of Chicago requesting the City oppose the legislation for a variety of
reasons. The Board directed Mr. Kugler to send the drafted letter directly to the Governor,
with such drafted letter to include more information on the impact if passed.

•

Lastly, Mr. David Kugler then reviewed with the Trustees an update on the hospitalization
matters before Judge Cohen. Currently, two matters are before Judge Cohen; 1)
responsibility for payment of the subsidy – the City or the Funds and 2) whether the Funds
are responsible for contracting for insurance for members. Briefs on these issues are due in
the upcoming weeks.

All business concluded for this date, June 28, 2018, it was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by
Trustee Brown that this meeting be adjourned.
