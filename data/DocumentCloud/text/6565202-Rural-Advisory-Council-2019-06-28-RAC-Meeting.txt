PRESENTATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
NOACA Position on Proposed Fees for Transportation Infrastructure
Ms. Beverly Burtzlaff provided background on Governor Mike DeWine’s proposal of an 18 cent
per gallon increase for the motor fuel user for the 2020-2021 Ohio Transportation Budget.
Ms. Burtzlaff noted that the increase would be indexed to inflation for future years and would
generate $1.2 billion annually. She talked about the current gas tax and the need for more
funding.
Ms. Burtzlaff reviewed the following provisions included in the NOACA Board resolution that was
passed on March 8th:

8191c
1-1

 1. Amount of the user fee increase should be aligned to demonstrated need - at least 40%
back to locals
2. New user fee should be indexed to inflation
3. Distribute revenue in an equitable manner – benefits go back to the users
Ms. Burtzlaff stated that distribution of funds should be based on vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) to accurately reflect the actual usage compared to the current formulas using equal
splits, registrations, and centerline miles. She mentioned that the NOACA region loses
$26 million a year based on the current gas tax of 28 cents per gallon. Ms. Burtzlaff stated
that all, but one county, Geauga, would do better if a VMT-based formula was used.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA would look for ways to make Geauga County whole as
part of an equitable distribution.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that the region sends $225 million to Columbus, but only gets
back $75 million. She noted that the current formula includes a local component of 30%
that includes counties, municipalities and townships. Of the 30%, counties receive 37%,
which is distributed equally among all 88 counties in Ohio; municipalities receive 42%,
which is based on registrations; and townships receive 21%, which is based on
registrations and a formula based on centerline miles.
Ms. Gallucci talked about the inequity of the current formulas; the imbalance of where
people drive and where people’s vehicles are registered; communities not getting their fair
share of funding based on the use of the roads. Ms. Gallucci noted that the revenue
distribution problem could be solved by using a VMT-based formula or by allowing
counties to administer their own gas tax.
Ms. Burtzlaff reviewed the estimated FY 2020 revenues of 28 cents and 18 cents for the
five counties based on the current formula and a VMT-based formula. Ms. Burtzlaff
mentioned that donor counties receive less money than they should, while donee counties
receive more money than they should from the motor fuel user fee. Ms. Gallucci stated
that VMT is defined by vehicles traveling on roads from origin to destination, representing
the utilization of roads. Ms. Burtzlaff mentioned that NOACA gets its VMT numbers from
ODOT.
4. Increase funding for public transportation to at least the $120 million recommended in
ODOT’s 2015 study
5. Fund maintenance of state and local networks prior to new capacity
6. Continue to explore resources for transit, how alternate fuel vehicles can pay their fair
share, and additional permissive authority for locals on registration fees
Ms. Burtzlaff mentioned that Ms. Gallucci testified before the House Finance Committee and the
Senate Transportation Committee in support of increased funding for infrastructure on behalf of
the Ohio Association of Regional Councils (OARC).
Ms. Burtzlaff reviewed House Bill (HB) 62 and the Senate’s bill. She said both bills will be
presented to the Conference Committee for a compromise. Once a compromise has been
reached, a report will be sent back to the House and Senate for a final vote. She mentioned that
8191c
1-2

 State Senator Sandra Williams introduced an amendment that would divide up funding based on
VMT; unfortunately, that amendment did not make it into the transportation bill. Ms. Burtzlaff
stated that NOACA will continue to communicate the Board resolution to state legislature,
administration, and other external stakeholders.
Ms. Cathy Cotman stated that the proposed gas tax increase varies between Governor DeWine,
the House and the Senate. She asked the actually amount needed to maintain the roads in the
state.
Ms. Gallucci stated that Governor DeWine’s proposal was the closest, although more work needs
to be done to determine the actual amount needed at the local level. She said the state probably
needs a gas tax increase of 36 cents. She mentioned that roads maintained by ODOT could be
discussed at an OARC meeting.
Ms. White commented that Pennsylvania’s gas tax is 58.7 cents per gallon and their roads are
great, while the roads and bridges in this region are in poor condition. She mentioned that State
Representative Steve Hambley has been working on this issue, posted some information on
Facebook and was crucified by his community. She noted that had there been small increases
over the years, roads and bridges in this region would not be in their current condition. She said
there needs to be a compromise to move the region forward.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that Representative Hambley served on the NOACA Board for many
years and understands the issues affecting this region, especially the equity issue.
Ms. Kress stated that a 46 cent gas tax will get Ohio on par with Michigan and Indiana. She noted
that state legislators are reluctant to increase taxes because it is unpopular and they want to get
reelected.
Ms. Cotman asked how VMT is determined. Mr. David Short said ODOT does a lot of traffic
counts and traffic modeling. Ms. Gallucci mentioned that VMT captures the origin to destination
of every trip.
Ms. Cotman asked if the provisions in NOACA’s resolution would need to be included in the bill
or can the provisions be implemented after the bill has been approved. Ms. Gallucci said both
and noted that NOACA would like for the Governor, House and Senate to consider the provisions
when reconciling the three components or consider them the next time there is a gas tax increase
proposal.
Mr. Wesemeyer stated that the next gas tax increase could be 20 years from now. Ms. Gallucci
said there could be another increase before then and noted that nothing prohibits the state
legislature from making a change to the gas tax formulas.
NOACA SFY 2019 4th Quarter Project Planning Review (PPR)
Mr. Ed May provided background on PPR and reviewed a major rehabilitation project on US-20
in Madison Township (LAK US-20 – 24.99 PID No. 109270). The project consists of the following
road improvements: pavement replacement, minor widening (increased lane width), drainage
replacement and a sidewalk. Mr. May stated that the total cost of the project is $16 million; no
NOACA funds will be used; and project comments have been forwarded to the sponsor. He noted
that staff will coordinate with the sponsor on the proposed project.

8191c
1-3

 Ms. Gallucci asked members to share information with others if this project or future projects have
relevance in their community. She noted that comments can be made on NOACA’s website.
SFY 2021–2024 TIP Development Update – Potential Projects for NOACA Controlled Funds
Mr. Mike Daugherty provided background on the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and
reviewed the elements of the program. He noted that the TIP update was originally planned for
SFY 2020-2023. ODOT delayed the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) / TIP
development process by one year due to the uncertainty of federal funding, revised the timeframe
to SFY 2021-2024, and urged NOACA to proceed with its adoption of agency funded projects
according to the original schedule.
Mr. Daugherty stated that NOACA staff met with representatives of all five counties and the City
of Cleveland to review the accuracy of the projects. He noted that NOACA’s Surface
Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program and Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP) have
a total of $80 million available for SFY 2021-2024 and CMAQ funded projects have already been
approved through SFY 2024. He mentioned that NOACA received 212 project funding requests
from 50 communities totaling $301 million. He noted that the total cost of the projects is $608
million.
Mr. Daugherty reviewed the criteria used to evaluate qualifying projects. He noted that staff
considered regional connectivity factors, consistency with NOACA plans, NOACA Diversity and
Inclusion Policies, and urbanized versus rural areas.
Mr. Daugherty stated that project recommendations will be presented to the Planning and
Programming Committee (PPC) for action on April 12, 2019.
If endorsed by PPC,
recommendations will be presented to the Board for approval on June 14, 2019.
Ms. Cotman asked if the scoring system for the prioritization of projects is new. Mr. Daugherty
stated that the connectivity factors were already in place but were enhanced for the new TIP.
Mr. Wesemeyer asked staff to speak about ODOT’s concern for future federal funding.
Mr. Daugherty stated that ODOT wanted to get a better picture of future federal funding.
Mr. Wesemeyer asked if it was common for ODOT to delay the STIP/TIP. Ms. Gallucci said no.
Mr. Wesemeyer asked if staff knew the reason for the delay. Mr. Daugherty talked about the
uncertainty of future transportation bills. Ms. Gallucci commented that ODOT may be concerned
about the federal gas tax since it has not been increased since 1993.
Ms. Kress asked the meaning of TAP. Ms. Gallucci said Transportation Alternatives Program.
Ms. Kress asked if townships and counties can apply for TAP funds for roads.
Ms. Gallucci said yes, but noted that the roads have to be on the federal-aid system and must
meet the criteria to be eligible for funding. Ms. Kress asked if a road over the Ohio Turnpike
qualifies for funding. Ms. Gallucci said it could and asked RAC members to provide NOACA with
a list of roads in their communities so staff can check to see if they are currently on the system or
are eligible to be put on the system.
Ms. Cotman asked if the word “new” refers to a brand new road or road widening projects.
Ms. Gallucci said the word “new” refers to both. Ms. Cotman asked if the Board’s objectives
incorporated minimizing widening projects in the SFY 2021-2024 TIP.

8191c
1-4

 Ms. Gallucci stated that the Board is looking to prioritize maintenance projects before capacity
projects. She noted that widening projects may be considered if there are safety concerns.
New 208 Plan Draft Development
Ms. Pamela Davis provided background on the 208 Plan and NOACA’s responsibility as an
areawide water quality management agency. She provided an overview of the work done by the
208 Plan Working Group and Chapter Focus Groups. She noted that the 208 Plan update
included reviewing and editing chapter text, and developing regional strategies, agency
recommendations, and NOACA policies.
Ms. Davis stated that NOACA staff is planning to do additional outreach for the 208 Plan and has
developed two questionnaires that will be distributed throughout the region using social media,
Facebook, Twitter, direct mail, public meetings, and stakeholders. Ms. Davis reviewed the two
questionnaires: one for the “208 Public” and the other for designated management agencies
(DMAs), local health districts and affected jurisdictions. She informed members that Ms. Gallucci
will forward the “208 Public” questionnaire to them. Ms. Davis asked members to share the
questionnaire with their constituents when they receive it. She provided an overview of the types
of questions on both questionnaires.
Ms. Davis stated that the DMA/health district/jurisdiction questionnaire will be released in March
2019; the “208 Public” questionnaire will be released in April 2019; and questionnaire responses
and outreach meeting strategy will be presented to the Water Quality Subcommittee in June 2019.
Mr. Wesemeyer stated that the fringe area appears to get lost between the rural and urban areas.
Ms. Davis mentioned that Chapter 6 in the 208 Plan covers developed and developing areas
which includes information on fringe. Mr. Wesemeyer mentioned that there are property owners
in certain developed rural area with failing septic systems who cannot tie into the infrastructure of
a municipality because there is not enough funding available. Mr. Wesemeyer talked about
property owners having to come up with the money to replace their septic system.
Ms. Davis mentioned that on the “208 Public” questionnaire, people are asked to provide the type
of system they have or want and how much they would be willing to spend for it.
Mr. Wesemeyer stated that residents do not want to tie into a sewer unless the health department
tells them they have to because of a failing septic system. He said people need to be educated
on their options so they can plan ahead.
Ms. White mentioned that the Medina County Health Department has grants available for people
who need to repair or replace their existing septic system. She asked if those grants could be
used to tap into an existing sewer system.
Ms. Davis said she would have to check to see if there are limitations on the use of those funds.
She stated that the resident must enter into a cost share relationship with their county health
department and must meet the income requirement to qualify for those funds. The health
department would need to determine if tying into a sewer system is accessible and affordable.
Ms. White stated that replacing a septic system is a short-term approach, while connecting to a
sewer is a long-term approach. She mentioned that she talked to an owner of a golf course who
does not have a lot of money to replace a septic system and does not qualify for funds through
the county.
8191c
1-5

 Ms. Davis stated that Ohio EPA is currently working to identify small (25,000 gallons or less)
communal systems that are not under permit. She said there is a push by Ohio EPA Northeast
District Office to identify the location of those systems and get them under permit, and if they are
already under permit, make sure they are meeting the requirements.
Ms. Davis stated that staff is planning to update the county FPA maps every five years and will
be working with the health departments on reviewing hotspot areas that may or may not be
planning for sanitary sewers.
Ms. Cotman asked if the decision was made not to send the questionnaire out to the general
public. Ms. Davis stated that NOACA decided to share the questionnaire with the health
departments that will in turn share the questionnaire with the general public. Ms. Cotman asked
if NOACA wants RAC members to assist in the distribution of the questionnaire. Ms. Gallucci
said yes. Ms. Cotman asked how RAC will get the questionnaire. Ms. Gallucci said staff will
email members a link to the questionnaire, so it can be forwarded to others.
Ms. Cotman asked when the final draft 208 Plan will be completed. Ms. Davis said the plan is
90% complete and noted that a few changes still need to be made.
Ms. Kress mentioned that Cuyahoga County has a loan program that provides limited funding to
property owners who need to tie into an existing sewer. She mentioned that Cuyahoga County’s
base tie in costs $14,000 and some property owners have paid as much as $39,000.
Ms. Davis mentioned that the health departments have discussed the cost of tie ins and potential
funding sources.
Ms. Kress commented that planning for no plan is very critical, if for nothing more than to ensure
health departments are enforcing regulations on onsite septic systems.
Ms. Kress talked about how productive the focus group meetings have been for the 208 Plan
update.

RE:

NOACA Geauga County Amish Safety BUILD Project Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Geauga County Amish Safety project was developed as a result of a strategic safety plan completed in
2015 in partnership between Geauga County, ODOT District 12 and NOACA. The study identified projects
needed on Geauga County roadways to improve safety for motorists, Amish buggies, and pedestrians. In
2017, the identified projects were adopted into the NOACA AIM Forward 2040 Long-range Transportation
Plan.
In April 2018, NOACA partnered with the Geauga County Engineer to submit an application for a Geauga
County Amish Safety project for federal BUILD program funding consideration. The project includes
widening roadway shoulders for the construction of buggy lanes and pedestrian facilities; warning and
detection signal systems; and signage safety improvements. In December 2018, NOACA was notified by
US DOT that the project was selected for BUILD program funding for the full $9,651,000 request amount.
Since that time, staff has worked with the Geauga County Engineer, ODOT and FHWA to determine an
acceptable approach and initiate project programming and administration in accordance with the agencies’
oversight and monitoring requirements. Staff will provide an update of the project to the Council at its June
28th meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will continue to inform the council throughout project development and implementation.

RE:

Geauga County Facility Planning Area (FPA) Prescription Modification Request in
Chardon Township

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Berkshire Heights Estates Subdivision in south Chardon Township was developed in the 1950s and
1960s and has a significant number of failing on-site home sewage treatment systems (HSTSs). In 2013,
the Chardon Township Trustees submitted a public health nuisance complaint for the subdivision to Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) after trustees found a drainage line near the subdivision that
appeared to convey untreated sewage. Ohio EPA found the numerous failing HSTSs resulted in unsanitary
conditions and a public health nuisance. In 2015, the Ohio EPA issued a Director’s Final Findings and
Orders (DFFO) to the Geauga County Board of Commissioners. The DFFO required the County to produce
a sewage plan for the subdivision and install a sanitary sewage system within five (5) years. Geauga
County plans to start construction of sanitary sewer lines and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in 2019.
The subdivision’s current Prescription in NOACA’s Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan) is “no sewer service”
(Attachment A). This Prescription does not allow for sanitary sewer extensions or connections. Ohio EPA
cannot issue any permits that conflict with NOACA’s 208 Plan. Therefore, Geauga County requests the
Prescriptions be changed to “may be sewered” for the parcels that that will be connected to sanitary sewers
and the parcels where the WWTP will be constructed (Attachment B). The change will allow Ohio EPA to
issue the needed permits to Geauga County to proceed with the Ohio EPA required sanitary sewer project.
Chardon Township and Geauga County are the only affected jurisdictions. Both the Chardon Township
Board of Trustees and Geauga County Board of Commissioners support the proposed Prescriptions
changes (attached) which fulfills the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.
The NOACA Board of Directors approved this FPA prescription modification at its June 2019 meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the Prescription modification will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.

 CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will continue to update the Council members on pertinent FPA boundary modifications.

RE:

Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for Northeast Ohio

ACTION REQUESTED
No Action is requested. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The current Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for Northeast Ohio
(“Coordinated Plan”) was adopted by the NOACA Board of Directors in January 2015 and extended through
December 2018. The Coordinated Plan covers Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain and Medina Counties,
and will be updated for the years 2019-2022.
The federal circular for the Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310)
funding program requires that all projects funded must be “included in a locally developed, coordinated
public transit-human services transportation plan,” and “developed and approved through a process that
included participation by seniors, individuals with disabilities, representatives of public, private, and nonprofit
transportation and human services providers and other members of the public.”
NOACA began the plan update with outreach activities that included public meetings, a client/rider survey,
and a provider/stakeholder survey. Using this feedback, and input from NOACA Transit, Community
Advisory, Rural Advisory, and Bike and Pedestrian Councils, goals and strategies were developed for the
Coordinated Plan.
The Coordinated Plan acts as an evaluation tool to prioritize project funding for the Section 5310 program.
Section 5310 scoring criteria and prioritization for funding is guided by current and future regional needs
identified in the coordinated planning process. NOACA will also utilize Mobilize: Accessibility for
Independence as an action plan and will integrate adopted goals and strategies into the organization’s work
plan.

5-5

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
As the designated recipient, NOACA is eligible to access federal 5310 program funds apportioned to the
Cleveland Urbanized Area (UZA) and distribute them according to the federal guidelines. Up to 10% of these
program funds can be used by NOACA to cover its administrative costs for the development of plans by staff.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The NOACA Board of Directors approved, Mobilize: Accessibility for Independence as the Coordinated
Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Plan for Northeast Ohio for the years 2019-2022.

RE:

Planning Reviews (PPRs)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC); 1st
Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed projects to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, project sponsors will be notified that their projects have completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with project sponsors to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
History/Background: These projects are included in ODOT District 12’s Program.
Title: Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
Sponsor: City of Solon
Estimated Total Cost: $8,107,165
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program
provides funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective
activity designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program
is funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
Proposed Project: The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement
Program (HSIP) funding:
•

CUY SR-43 - 1.98: PID No. 109517 - This project involves reconstruction and widening
of SR-43 (Aurora Road), from 2 lanes to 3 lanes, from the Solar Shopping Center, 0.13
mile east of SR-91 (SOM Center Road) to Liberty Road, in Solon (schematic). The
scope will also include a new water line, storm sewer, a permanent traffic signal at Portz
Parkway, a multipurpose path on the south side of Aurora Road and an on-street bike
lane on the north side with new sidewalks. Right turn lanes will be installed at Clearwater
Court, Portz Parkway and Liberty Road.
The project’s estimated total cost is $8,107,605. The estimated cost of preliminary
engineering preliminary development (PEPD) is $64,974. The estimated cost of

Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o Level 2 of NOACA Freight Network, meaning relatively high truck counts. Design should
consider their turning movements mainly at the shopping center.
o Include high-visibility crosswalks and pedestrian countdown heads with the new signal at
Portz Parkway.
o Include pedestrian crossing for Aurora Road.
Committee Review:
Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory Council (BPAC)
RECOMMENDATIONS:
o Consider providing less width to the vehicular lanes and more width to the bike lane
and/or create a buffer between the bike lane. However, the Safety and Operations
Council cautioned not to reduce the eastbound travel lane as some cyclists may still
choose to use the road rather than the side path.
5-9

 o
o

Consider a shared use path on both sides of the road in lieu of the bike lane (allocate the
5 feet to creating a path,10 feet wide, rather than a path, 5 feet wide and a bike lane, 5
feet wide).
BPAC strongly recommends signing and or centerline striping on the new multi-use path.
Since the existing sidewalk on the south side is being widened to serve as a multi-use
path, BPAC recommends measures that will identify that the facility has changed and
cyclists are permitted on the path.
