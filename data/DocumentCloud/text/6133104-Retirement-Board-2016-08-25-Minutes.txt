The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

Disability recipient Dean Angelo, previously forwarded communication to the Fund that he wished to
return to active duty with the CPD, thereby his disability benefit was terminated July 31, 2016.
Accordingly, the Board approved an Order, which was sent to Officer Angelo. Subsequently, Officer
Angelo, through his attorney, requested some word changes - not to change the Board-issued Order.
A follow-up letter was sent by Board counsel. A further request has been made by Officer Angelo’s
attorney to indicate that changes in the Chicago Police Department policy allow for Officer Angelo to
return to duty under the new sworn limited duty program, given his medical condition. Upon Board
agreement, Fund counsel will produce subsequent communication to Officer Angelo which will
reflect the agreed changes.

•

An invitation from the Chicago Police Memorial Foundation for its annual reception and candlelight
vigil on September 13, 2016, at 5:00 pm is extended to all trustees and staff.

•

An update on the Fund’s 2016 Annuitant Signature Affidavit was provided. There are approximately
120 retirees and widows who have not responded to the Fund’s first or second request nor telephone
contact. After much discussion, mutual decision was to do a final review at the end of September,
and prepare to inactivate the individuals that have not complied.

 MINUTES CONTINUED
August 25, 2016

•

The Fund recently upgraded the death service utilized to receive notifications of member deaths. The
new system has found deaths of some retirees and/or widows which were not reported to the Fund.
Staff is working on retrieving any distributions made after dates of death and any required reporting,
and the Board will be kept updated on the progress.

•

Senate Bill 777 became law at the end of May 2016. Contained in this bill was the significant funding
change as well as another item which relates to the minimum annuity for retirees. The bill provides
that any policeman who retired from service prior to January 1, 2016, at age 50 or over with 20 or
more years of service, or any policeman who retired from service due to disability and is entitled to an
annuity on January 1, 2016, shall receive a monthly annuity that is no less than 125% of the federal
poverty level. Staff is reviewing the retiree amounts, including all cost of living adjustments, to
determine eligibility. The base annuity award alone will not be used to determine eligibility, but
rather the base annuity plus any cost-of-living adjustment will be included in the annuity granted for
comparison purposes to the poverty index.

•

At a prior Investment Committee meeting there was indication that one of the underlying investments
of Invesco (Chancellor), has a recorded value of approximately $75,000. Invesco has indicated a
method to sell this holding, which would involve a completed Power-of-Attorney, to allow Invesco to
conduct all transactions necessary to accomplish the sale on behalf of the Fund. The Board agreed
with this recommendation, given the value of the holding. The Power-of-Attorney is in lieu of a sale
document, which would require a legal review by the Fund.

•

The Fund has been officially appointed lead plaintiff in the Gerdau case and is under obligation to
ensure that all document retention requirements are followed with respect to this matter.

It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Maloney that the Board go into executive session
per 2 (c)(11).
