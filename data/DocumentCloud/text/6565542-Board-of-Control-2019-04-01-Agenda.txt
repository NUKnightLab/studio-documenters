 Mike Foley, Department of Sustainability, presented. Trevor McAleer inquired as to why the item is not
being processed as sole source vs. providing an RFP exemption as the item detail states the organization
is the only vendor that can provide the services. Mr. Foley said that an RFP exemption was the
procurement method used for the past 2 years and stated that he is willing to do a sole source process in
the future, as the vendor does a great job for the County and he doesn’t know of anyone else who could
provide the services. Mr. Foley stated that he does not want the project held up as information sessions
are planned for April. Mr. McAleer stated he doesn’t want to delay the project but if the vendor is the
only provider that can provide the service, his preference would be to have the vendor sign a sole source
affidavit and the Board would then approve the item as sole source or the Department needs to
competitively bid out the services. Matt Carroll asked for clarification on whether the award would have
to come back to the Board for approval. Mr. McAleer replied yes but said sometimes the vendor may not
want to sign the sole source affidavit, and as a result the department would choose an Alternative
Procurement method. Mr. Carroll asked if the Board could approve the item pending receipt of a signed
affidavit provided by the vendor. Mr. McAleer deferred the question to the Office of Procurement and
Diversity. Rich Opre stated that two processes are being discussed, one of which is to have the vendor
sign a sole source affidavit. Mr. Opre clarified that if a sole source process is utilized the item would have
to be reprocessed through the Onbase system and posted for 5 days on the County’s Website. After
further discussion the Board recommended the item be approved contingent upon the vendor submitting
a signed sole source affidavit. Andria Richardson, Clerk of the Board stated the item would have to be
amended to remove the RFP exemption language. Matt Carroll motioned to approve the item as
amended; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-243 was conditionally approved by unanimous vote.
BC2019-244
Office of Innovation and Performance,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ44920, which will result in a membership with City Innovate Inc.

D. – Consent Agenda
Dale Miller referred to Item BC2019-249 and asked why the contract was being terminated; Sarah Baker,
Juvenile Court replied that the individual responsible for overseeing the training portion for the Project
did not complete any of the reporting and training. Juvenile Court informed the Ohio Supreme Court, who
provides the grant funds of the situation. The vendor refused to work with Juvenile Court to make
improvements so Juvenile Court has decided to terminate the contract with the vendor and will try to
develop the Project in-house. Mr. Miller asked how much has been paid out of the contract and asked if
the Court is doing anything to recoup those funds. Joe Nanni commented that the County has several
agencies who could make an attempt to recoup those funds, especially if the County has not received any

Item No. 4
Court of Common Pleas
In November 2017 the Corrections Planning Board applied to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation –
Bureau of Community Sanctions (BCS) for a Justice Reinvestment Incentive Grant (JRIG) for State Fiscal
Years 2018-2019. This resulted in an award to the Corrections planning board in the amount of
$1,515,637 for the period 12/17/2017 through 06/30/19. The Board of Control approved acceptance of
this award on 01/09/18. The basis for this JRIG Grant was to (1) contract for Cognitive Behavioral
Intervention for Employment (CBI/EMP) of Probationers. This specific service is a validated Best-Practice
developed by the Corrections Institute at the Center for Criminal Justice Research at the University of

41

 Cincinnati’s School of Criminal Justice, and (2) for Community Reentry Services for offenders remanded to
the CBCF.
Once the Corrections Planning Board knew the amount of our award in December 2017, an internal RFI
process was completed for CBI/EMP services, resulting in an award to the winning Vendor in April
2018. Probationers were first accepted into the CBI/EMP program in May 2018. There was a second
delay in implementing the Community Reentry Services for offenders remanded to the CBCF due to
Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime (TASC) needing to post for and hire three (3) FTEs to implement
the program.
Because the grant award was dated 12/17/17, and the required implementation time for both JRIG
funded programs, the Corrections Planning Board proposed a grant reduction in the amount of
$189,048 to the Bureau of Community Sanctions. This current grant amendment memorializes this
reduction and will provide ODRC with the flexibility to redirect the funding that cannot be spent during
the current two-year State budget cycle.
