Member Contributions
At the April 2019 Retirement Board meeting, a couple of trustees raised an issue regarding
concerns they had heard from active members regarding active members’ pension contributions
being used to pay the annuities of retired members due to the current underfunded status of the
FABF and, therefore, the risk that active members’ contributions would not be available to
refund to the members, if requested. I would like to take this opportunity to address those
concerns.
The pension plan that our members participate in is a defined benefit plan. Our defined benefit
plan requires members to earn service credits and to contribute a portion of their earnings from
employment with the Chicago Fire Department to become eligible for a benefit in retirement.
The benefit provided to eligible retired members is a lifetime annuity and a lifetime annuity for
eligible spouses, which would be awarded upon the death of the member. Our plan sponsor, the
City of Chicago, has the legal requirement to ensure payment of the awarded annuities.
Active members’ pension contributions are tracked and reported to the membership on an annual
basis. Each individual member’s pension contributions are tracked for the purpose of ensuring
that such member has made the required contributions to the plan prior to being awarded a
lifetime annuity. According the Fund’s FY 2017 actuarial valuation report approximately one
out of three of active members do not currently have a statutory right to a refund of total

 contributions because of the member’s age and earned service credit; such members only have a
right to an annuity. Additionally, the Fund’s FY 2017 actuarial valuation report indicates total
member contribution refunds in 2017 of $3,579,629 as compared to member contributions of
$47,364,276 and employer contributions of $228,452,611 in the same year. This equates to
refunds of contributions in an amount equal to 1.3% of total member and employer contributions
paid into the Fund in 2017.
There are two critical points of clarification from a legal perspective that every plan participant
needs to understand:
1. The pension benefit that you earn through you employment with the Chicago Fire
Department is currently protected by the Illinois Constitution.
2. Under current law, your right to a pension benefit does not include minimum plan
funding levels based on individual participant contributions.
The following court cases reinforce these above points: People ex rel. Sklodowski v. State
182 Ill. 2d 220 (1998); In re Pension Reform Litig., 2015 IL 118585; McNamee v. State of
Illinois, 173 Ill. 2d 433 (1996); Jones v. Municipal Employees’ Annuity & Benefit Fund, 216
IL 119618; Board of Trustees of the Riverdale Police Pension Fund v. Village of Riverdale,
2014 IL App (1st) 130416; and, most recently, Board of Trustees of the City of Harvey
Firefighters’ Pension Fund v. City of Harvey, 2017 IL App (1st) 153074.
Retired members of the Chicago Fire Department have been receiving their statutorily
required annuity payments for over 130 years, including during the Great Depression, Great
Recession, and two world wars and I have every reason to believe they will continue to do so
in the future.
However, any attempt to revise the State of Illinois Constitution to alter or eliminate the
pension guarantees would have to be fought vigorously by active and retired members alike.
If you ever have any questions or concerns regarding this subject, please feel free to contact
me directly.

Fund Secretary,

Captain Anthony Martin
