GENERAL BACKGROUND

Resident Services previously entered into contracts with the ten agencies for service provision in
2012. Five of these contracts were initiated through a non-competitive procurement based on the
Master Development Agreements (MDA) with the developers at mixed income sites (BMT,
Eastlake, Holsten, LR ABLA and Stateway). The other ?ve were initiated based on a
competitive procurement completed in 2009 for the FamilyWorks program (CNH, EES, HHCS,
MFS and UCAN).

As part of strategic planning process, Resident Services desires to begin implementing its
reimagined service model in 2013. Major changes to the service model include segmenting the
resident population to ensure services better address the individual needs of families based on
their circumstances, instead of providing the same case management services for all public
housing families. These changes will create capacity for service providers to begin providing
additional services to the Housing Choice Voucher population. By exercising a remaining option
year with the FamilyWorks providers and entering into new contracts with the mixed-income
providers identi?ed through the MDAS. changes to the reimagined service model may be
implemented quickly and ef?ciently. This will allow the new program areas to take hold while

ins-r? it"? -859 If 5t? 

causing minimal disruption to residents. During 2013, a new RFP will be released to fully
transition to the new model for services in 2014.

Services for the segmented population include, but are not limited to:

delivering targeted services based on a family?s percentage of area median income
(AMI), including transition counseling for those families who are more readily able to
begin the transition out of public housing;

offering workforce development and education services to assist work-eligible adults to
increase their percentage of AMI and move forward toward economic self-suf?ciency;
continuing speci?c coordination services to participants of the Family Self Suf?ciency
Program;

providing senior residents in family housing (ages 62 and over) with resident service
coordinators that will report to Resident Services? Director of Senior Services;
outreaching to all households with youth as opportunities are available through CHA and
partner organizations;

ensuring that wellness and other supportive services are available to all families upon
request; and

creating capacity for service providers to begin offering services for Housing Choice
Voucher (HCV) participants.

Service providers will work closely with CHA staff and property management to facilitate
communication and coordination of resident needs lease compliance). The ten (10)
agencies are assigned to speci?c zip codes and/or mixed-income properties throughout the City
of Chicago and will be available to provide various levels of service to more than 10,000 CHA
families in 2013.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

The EVP of Resident Services concurs with the recommendation to enter into or extend
contracts with CNH, EES, HHCS, MFS, UCAN, BMT, Eastlake, LR ABLA, Stateway and
Holsten as service providers in 2013.

The CEO/President recommends the approval to exercise the third one-year option of Contract No.
9121 with Centers for New Horizons, Contract No. 9124 with Employment Employer Services,
Contract No. 9122 with Heartland Human Care Services, Contract No. 9123 with Metropolitan
Family Services, and Contract No. 9126 with Uhlich Children?s Advantage Network and enter into
contracts with Brinshore Michaels Taylor LLC, Eastlake Management, LR ABLA, LLC, Stateway
