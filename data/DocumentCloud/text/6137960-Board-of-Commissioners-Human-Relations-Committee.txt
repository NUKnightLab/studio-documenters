 COOK COUNTY UNITY
WHEREAS, Cook County is home to over one million immigrants from all over the world; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has benefitted culturally, socially and economically from the diversity of its
residents; and
WHEREAS, the national political climate has produced fear and anxiety among many Cook County
residents, particularly among people of color, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, and members of the LGBTQ
community; and
WHEREAS, health care providers and mental health experts have reported that frequently marginalized
youth, LGBTQ and gender non-conforming youth, refugee/immigrant children and youth are experiencing
significant distress as a result of the national discourse; and
WHEREAS, calls to mental health hot lines increased 200% in Illinois post-election with immigrants
reporting anxiety and hopelessness due to fears of deportation for themselves or members of their
communities; and
WHEREAS, racism, xenophobia, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and
all other forms of hate have no place in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, resolution 07-R-240 declared Cook County a Fair and Equal County for Immigrants ensuring
equal access to essential benefits and opportunities; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we reaffirm our commitment to being a Fair and Equal
County for all immigrants, refugees, and their families; and will energetically oppose any efforts that
conflict with those values or reverse critical protections to immigrants, refugees, and their families; and,
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we will continue to honor and protect the rights of all residents,
regardless of race, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, age, immigration status, criminal record, sexual
orientation, and gender identity; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we will never waver on our commitment to ensuring women's rights
in healthcare, in the workplace, in the home, and in the streets; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we remain deeply committed to religious freedom, and oppose any
discriminatory treatment or persecution on the basis of faith; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we honor the rights of all individuals within the LGBTQ community
to live without fear of discrimination or harassment; and we will support all of the progress we have made
as a society in advancing LGBTQ rights; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, we will continue our commitment to address the over-incarceration of
Black and Brown communities and reducing the number of individuals in the criminal justice, juvenile
justice, and immigrant detention systems, while reinvesting the resulting savings to address acute education,
healthcare, employment, housing, minority-owned small business development and environmental needs
in the communities most affected; and
