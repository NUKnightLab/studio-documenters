knowledge in accessibility modifications and employed staff that was capable of overseeing on‐site
modification work in private units throughout the City of Chicago. The Mayor’s Office for People with

(Item 9)
The local distributor of electricity for Chicago, Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), received a U. S.
Department of Energy SunShot grant to build a microgrid in the Bronzeville community. ComEd then
issued an RFP for Solar Developers to submit proposals to install solar electricity generation facilities
within the established boundaries of the Bronzeville microgrid. Two solar developers approached the
CHA to asses Dearborn Homes for a potential solar project. However, only VLV Development asked
the CHA to partner on submitting a proposal in response to ComEd’s solicitation for the installation of
an onsite distributed solar generation system at Dearborn Homes. ComEd chose VLV’s proposal and
awarded them a contract to design, install, operate and maintain this solar system. The next step is for
the CHA to enter into a Power Purchase and Lease Agreement (PPLA) with VLV to buy the electricity
that the solar installation will generate. The PPLA will be a sole source contract with VLV because they
were the only solar developer that chose to partner with the CHA in response to the RFP solicited by
ComEd. Accordingly, the resolution for Item No. 9 approves a PPLA with VLV for the supply of
renewable electricity at Dearborn Homes. The current technical performance model for the solar
installation anticipates that it will generate 15% of Dearborn Homes’ annual electrical usage. The PPLA
with VLV will detail the responsibilities for operations and maintenance of all equipment and materials
that collectively generate renewable energy for a term up to 20 years. This agreement will also confirm a
unit price per kWh of electricity generated from the solar installation.
