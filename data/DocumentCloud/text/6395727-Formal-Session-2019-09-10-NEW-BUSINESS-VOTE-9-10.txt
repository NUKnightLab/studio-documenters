RE: Request to Vacate Ailey 19125 Mapleview 8. Accessory Parking for Property 
Petition Generated for DPW

Dear City of Detroit Appropriate Departments:

The petitioner Mr. Belief Emadamerho, Greatness, LLC, Owners of Pharmacy 4 Less,
incorporated in 2011 based on the desire to better serve the community with the Osborn
Business Center, Pharmacy to Dispense and Deliver Medication to the elders and low income
individuals without transportation we submit the following.

We seek to build on the property located at 13641 E. 7 Mile Rd., Detroit, MI, 48205 to
further improve the outlook, condition, and lives of residents in the Osborn Community. In
order to do such we need to purchase the Lot at 19125 Mapleview, which was originally zoned
as Residential at Present, but no longer possess a residence on the property, as it was
demolished years ago. The purpose is to have adequate parking, thus we Seek ?Accessory
Parking" Vacation of One (1) Bordering Alleys, after researching and meeting with key city
staff of BSEED, which we are appreciative of their service and availability.

Belief Emadamerho, Owner and Resident Pharmacist, who is also a Founding Member of the
Osborn Business Association (OBA) a Division of the Osborn Neighborhood Alliance (ONA), has
over 20 years of experience as a practicing licensed Pharmacist in the Underserved/Low Income
community. He seeks to serve and close the gap between pharmacist and the patients they
serve.

Until recently, most Pharmacies are stand-alone entities and as such, patients must go to a
separate facility to see a doctor before forwarding their prescription to the pharmacy of their
choice. The business concept of greatness, LLC is to provide a facility, The Osborn Center that
will have a ?One?Stop? capability such as In House?Doctor, Pharmacy, Business Center, and
Youth Entrepreneurship Training Center to serve the Osborn Community. We desire to change
the perception and outlook about the Osborn Community.

Our expansion plan will include properties and land on 13641 E. 7 Mile Rd., 13619 E. 7 Mile
Rd. and 19125 Mapleview, all of which are in Detroit, MI, 48205. The combined properties
which shall have a alley in between is meant to house the Osborn Center and Parking Lot. The
alley require a "Vacation Of Alley" which of course would be maintained within the said

property and release the City of Detroit from the liability of maintaining the alleys, which have
been maintained lately by Mr. Belief Emadamerho ONA in clean-up projects.

We need the alley vacated because it would be beneficial to our ever increasing customers in
the aspect of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic around the business complex. This will afford
vehicular movement in and out ofthe complex. It would also ease traffic around the
neighboring gas station.

Lastly, We Seek a Hearing before City Council, if necessary, and would be grateful for
approval from all appropriate departments in this land acquisition. Further, that the 19125
Mapleview at present does not produce property tax for the City of Detroit, thus serve as a
liability unto the City of Detroit, and we seek to remove from City Land Bank and/or City
Building Authority where appropriate.

Sincerely Yours,

REFERRED TO THE FOLLOWING 

PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT DPW -
CITY ENGINEERING DIVISION

BY COUNCIL MEMBER SCOTT BENSON 

RESOLUTION TO AFFIRM SUPPORT FOR THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and physical
welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative functions; and

WHEREAS, On January 1, 1979, the United States and People?s Republic of China
(referred to as ?China?) of?cially established diplomatic relations, with 2019 marking the 40th anniversary of United
States-China relations; and

WHEREAS, Since US ship "Empress of China? sailed to China over 230 years ago, trade and exchanges between
the US and China have continued to ?ourish, transforming the world in the process; and

WHEREAS, Over the past four decades, exchanges and cooperation between the two countries have scored historic
achievements. Forty years ago there only several thousand visits made between the two countries each year. In 2017,
over 5.3 million visits were made between the two countries. Forty years ago, the bilateral trade volume was less
than $2.5 billion. In 2018, it surpassed $659 billion. Forty years ago, the two-way investment between China and the
US was almost zero. Today, two-way investment in various forms amounted to over $230 billion in accumulative
terms; and

WHEREAS, Not only our two countries, but the entire world has bene?ted enormously from our ties over the past
forty years. From advancing the proper settlement of regional hot-spot issues, to ?ghting international terrorism,
tackling the global ?nancial crisis, and promoting global growth, China and the US have conducted extensive
cooperation at bilateral, regional and global levels; and

WHEREAS, The steady growth of China?US relations is indispensable to the success of our two countries and the
world, and it would be irresponsible and detrimental for us to ?decouple" or become isolated from each other; and

WHEREAS, Michigan has a signi?cant and historical role in the opening of relations between the US and China.
Our state has been dedicated to developing cooperative relations with China for decades, and the mutual exchanges
and cooperation have ?ourished in recent years. Michigan has a newly established sister state?province relationship
with Guangdong Province. The state has attracted over 300 Chinese companies that represent more than $4 billion in
investment and support more than 10,000 jobs for local communities; and

WHEREAS, Michigan is ranked 15th in the US, as the home to more than 60,000 residents of Chinese heritage who
have contributed greatly to the strength of our country and our state; and

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, The Detroit City Council commemorates the 40th anniversary of
diplomatic relations between the United States and People?s Republic of China and hereto declare September 13th,
2019, as Detroit China Day in the city of Detroit.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, and City Engineering DPW. at

DTE Gas Company reports having facilities in the area and will need a private easement to be
granted by CA in order to maintain their facilities.

reports having facilities in the area with an estimated cost of $76,321.84 to relocate their
facilities. FCA is making arrangements for the relocation.

DTE Energy Electric objects to the property change. FCA continues to work with DTE to make
mutually satisfactory arrangements for removal of DTE facilities or granting of a private easement.

Detroit Fire Department (DFD) reports involvement but no objection provided FCA maintains
emergency vehicle access to all existing building structures and hydrants.

Public Lighting Department (PLD) has an objection to the vacation at the area of Mack Service
Drive, because of the 24KV High Voltage Cable crossing the area of the outright vacation. They
have no objections to all of the other areas of the request. FCA will be granting a private easement
to PLD in the area of Mack Service Road.

Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) reports having facilities in the area and will need a private
easement to be granted by FCA in order to maintain their facilities.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the vacations, provided
certain conditions are met. The specific DWSD conditions and provisions for granting of private
easements are included in the resolution. DWSD reports that for all of the subject alleys there are
no water mains, and the existing sewers can be removed. For Canal Street and Freud Avenue, no
water mains or sewers exist. For Conner Lane, the 8 inch water main can be removed North of
Mack Service Road after the 8 inch gate valve, and no sewer exists. For Conner Lane, South of
the North line of Mack Service Road an easement acceptable to DWSD must be granted by FCA.
For the storm sewer pipe encroachment in Beniteau Avenue approval is given per plans received
by DWSD. DWSD requests the right to reserve an easement 30 feet in width to the West from the
western edge of the Conner Creek Canal extending the length of Canal Street to the Detroit River
for a possible future expansion of the Conner Creek Facility.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies informed of this
petition have reported no objections to the vacations. commitment to continue working

attached resolution.
