ITEM #2
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 14, 2009 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 05-43-628 with the law firm of
Linebarger, Goggan, Blair & Sampson, LLP (“Linebarger Goggan”), Chicago, Illinois for the collection
of outstanding receivables; said renewal term shall be for the period of September 19, 2009 through
September 18, 2010. During the term of Linebarger Goggan’s contract, two using departments have
initiated collections of outstanding receivables through Linebarger Goggan, the Department of Revenue
and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System. In the Department of Revenue, Linebarger Goggan
has achieved a 64% recovery rate on cigarette tax collections and has collected over $1.2 million out of
the $1.8 million dollars referred on cigarette tax since January 2006; while collections in outstanding use
tax has generated over $300,000.00. While engaged at the Health System, Linebarger Goggan has
collected over $12 million dollars, manned customer service phone lines for patient accounting, processed
over 14,000 Limit of Liability applications for placed accounts, provided revenue cycle management
guidelines and collection practices and identified over 6,000 accounts with eligible insurance information.
Reason:

Linebarger Goggan's contract expires on September 18, 2009 and a one (1) year renewal is
requested while a broad based Request for Proposal ("RFP") for countywide collections
services is developed. During the renewal term, an RFP will be developed with the input of
the various offices of the separately elected officials to consolidate the County's collection
processes. In addition to the above, the Department of Revenue has begun to utilize

additional collection services will be needed after the Administrative Hearings process is
completed.

Re:

No Cash Bid Request Package for the Village of East Hazel Crest

I respectfully submit for your approval the Village of East Hazel Crest’s request to acquire the following
vacant unimproved commercial property in an effort to increase tax revenues and development within
Village limits. The single parcel is identified with the Property Index Number (PIN) of:
VILLAGE OF EAST HAZEL CREST
PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER

VOLUME

The Village of East Hazel Crest has identified this parcel as a potential site for commercial redevelopment
and public roadway expansion. This parcel is immediately adjacent to a TIF district within the Village of
East Hazel Crest that is scheduled for development. The development is contingent upon approval from
IDOT of a traffic signal at the intersection of 174th Street and Halsted Street. IDOT requires that the
roadway in the vicinity of the traffic light be widened which requires additional right-of-way. This parcel
would be necessary if the Village of East Hazel Crest is to meet that requirement. East Hazel Crest is a
small land locked community with a small business base. This particular TIF is the only area of
opportunity for economic development; therefore the installation of traffic signal is crucial to our
economic expansion; which means that in order to make it happen we need additional right-or-way. This
parcel will satisfy the right-of-way requirement.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will file for and maintain tax exempt status for the portion of the property
that will be used for public roadway and until a developer is located for any remainder.
There is no third party request, proposal or agreement by a developer, organization or other private party
for this no-cash bid request.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will retain the legal services of Hiskes, Dillner, O’Donnell, Marovich &
Lapp, LTD, attorneys for the Village, to obtain the tax deed and the Village will bear all legal and other
costs associated with acquisition of the parcel.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will also annually report to the Cook County Office of Economic
Development informing and updating the County as to the status of the parcel of property for five years or
until the intended development is completed, whichever comes last.

This request package is for the one (1) Property Index Number (PIN) described above.
I believe that utilization of the County’s No Cash Bid Program is the only means by which this property
can be returned to the tax rolls. The above identified property consists of an industrial building that is
located within the Village of Glenwood’s industrial park. The building on this property has been vacant
for several years, is run down and is in need of environmental remediation. Other efforts to use the
County’s tax sale procedure to transfer this property to a user that will actually occupy the property, pay
taxes and create jobs have failed. This property was previously sold for delinquent taxes for the year 2002
and prior years (Certificate of Purchase No. 02-0000194). However, after the tax purchaser determined
that the property was in need of environmental remediation, this sale was vacated by a Court order dated
January 23, 2008. Submitted under Tab 1 is a copy of the January 23, 2008 court order that vacated the
tax sale of this property because the property contained “hazardous materials requiring removal under the
Illinois EPA and the U.S. EPA.”
Property taxes have not been paid on this property for many years. The title work enclosed with this
package reflects that the taxes due for the first and second installments for the 2006 and 2007 taxes have
not been paid. The first installment for the 2008 taxes also remains unpaid. In addition, the submitted
January 23, 2008 court order vacating the 2002 tax sale as a sale in error obligates the County to
reimburse the prior tax purchaser all the taxes that it has paid. It is therefore appears that this property has
not contributed property tax revenue since at least 2002.
Statement of intended use.
The property described by the above PIN# 32-09-201-023-0000 consists of a single lot that is improved
with one large industrial building. The building has been vacant for many years. This property is located
in the Village’s industrial park and is also located within the Village’s existing Industrial Park Tax
Increment Financing District.
It is the Village of Glenwood’s desire to obtain title to this property through the County’s No Cash Bid
Program so that the environmental hazards on this property can be corrected. As a result of the hazardous
materials located on this property, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has scheduled
operations to remove the existing hazardous materials located in the tanks and exterior spill from the 55gallon drums. This work will not result in the property being deemed to be free from contamination.
After the United States Environmental Protection Agency completes this work, it is anticipated that a
more work will need to be done to assess the overall environmental condition of the property. In addition,
there will need to be repairs to the building and its roof before it could be considered as being a usable
piece of property. After the property has been returned to a usable condition, the Village intends to
transfer this property to an end user that will utilize the property, pay real estate taxes and create jobs.
At present, this property and its building represent the largest abandoned piece of vacant industrial
property that is located within the Village. Returning this property to a usable condition will greatly
impact the Village by creating much needed jobs and property tax revenue for the Village and all other
taxing bodies. If the Village does not act, this property will continue to deteriorate, remain a target for
vandals and not in any manner contribute to the welfare of the Village, the County and the local school
districts.
Statement of Intent to file for tax-exempt status.
In the event this application is approved, it is the Village’s intent to file the necessary documents that are
required to obtain a tax-exempt status for the property. The Village will continue to maintain this tax
exempt status for the property until such time that the property can be transferred to a private owner that
will create jobs and return this property to the tax rolls.

In the event this application is approved, the Village will retain legal counsel in order to obtain the tax

The Village understands and agrees that it will need to comply with the reporting requirements of the
County’s No Cash Bid Ordinance. This will require the Village to submit No Cash Bid Reports on the
status of the parcel for the later of either five years or the completion of the development.

This request package is for the one (1) Property Index Number (PIN) described above.
The above property is a small, vacant, unimproved 20 foot by 65 foot parcel of property that is located in
area that was previously subdivided in the early 1970’s but never built. In total, the area where this parcel
is located includes 163 unimproved lots. All these unimproved 163 lots make up a rectangular area of
approximately 615 feet by 1,295 feet (18.28 acres). This area is located adjacent to and east of railroad
tracks. In the mid 1990’s the Village acquired title to all but 6 of the lots in this area through tax deeds
that were recorded as document numbers 94-471283 and 95-146723. The single lot that is the subject of
this application is surrounded on all sides by other lots that were acquired by the Village of Glenwood in
the mid 1990’s. This single lot is not improved and is not served by any roads or utilities.
Property taxes have not been paid on the subject property for many years. The title work enclosed with
this package reflects that the taxes have not been paid for this parcel since 1987.

Statement of intended use.
As stated above, the single lot that is the subject of this application is a small 20 foot by 65 foot
unimproved parcel that is surrounded by other lots that the Village acquired by tax deed in the mid 1990s.
The surrounding property that the Village already owns includes approximately 18 acres that is located
east of railroad tracks. The Village acquired these lots in the 1990s with the purpose of using them to
develop a Metra station that would serve a new commuter rail line using the adjacent railroad tracks.
The Village’s desire to develop this area with a Metra station and related parking is now becoming a
reality. The Village has been actively participating in the planning for a new commuter rail line that will
run on the railroad tracks that are adjacent to the area where the subject property is located. The Village
has been awarded a grant by the RTA for the purpose of performing the studies that are necessary for the
establishment of a commuter train station at this location. The study that has been funded by this RTA
grant is currently being performed.
It is the Village’s plan to utilize the lot that is the subject of this request as well as the other 18 acres of
property that it already owns in this area for the purpose of developing a new commuter rail station and
parking for the new commuter rail line that is being planned for the railroad tracks located adjacent to the
Village’s property. The development of this new station and railroad line would be a great asset to the
Village, result in additional jobs, spur additional economic development and result in a positive increase
in the Village’s property values.
Statement of Intent to file for tax-exempt status.
In the event this application is approved, it is the Village’s intent to file the necessary documents that are
required to obtain a tax-exempt status for the property. Since the project planned for the subject lot and
the surrounding area will be publicly owned, the Village will need to continue to maintain this tax exempt
status for the property.
Statement establishing the lack of a third party request.
Please be advised that the Village does not have any agreements to convey the perfected tax deed for the
property to any developer, organization or other private party. The Village also has not entered into any
negotiations with any developer, organization, or other entity pertaining to this property. This Village is
pursuing this project in order to further its plans for the development of the subject lot and the
surrounding property it already owns for a new commuter rail station. The Village’s is not acting on
behalf of a any third party requestor.
Statement establishing the Village’s intent to retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all
legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcel through the tax deed process.
In the event this application is approved, the Village will retain legal counsel in order to obtain the tax
deed. It will be the Village responsibility to bear all legal and other costs that are necessary for its

Statement of intent to comply with the County’s reporting requirements.
The Village understands and agrees that it will need to comply with the reporting requirements of the
County’s No Cash Bid Ordinance. This will require the Village to submit No Cash Bid Reports on the

PROPOSED RESOLUTION continued
ITEM #37 cont’d
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health receives approximately $2 million annually
from this grant to fund its core mandated public health programs; namely, investigation and control of
communicable diseases, including sexually transmitted diseases, and the administration of immunizations
and environmental health regulatory programs including but not limited to retail food sanitation
inspections, swimming pool inspections, and the regulation of private sewage disposal systems; and
WHEREAS, the termination of the Local Health Protection Grant will adversely, and potentially
irreparably, diminish the capacity of the Cook County Department of Public Health to perform these
critical functions and to respond to public health emergencies; and
WHEREAS, the termination of the Local Health Protection Grant will further adversely affect the ability
of the Cook County Department of Public Health to respond to the Influenza Type A H1N1 pandemic
making the timing of the elimination of the grant particularly unwise; and
WHEREAS, it is the belief that the elimination of the Local Health Protection Grant is very shortsighted
and it will likely result in great hardship, expense, and threat to life and health as a result of the inability
to perform these core functions as powers and duties delegated to certified local health departments by the
Illinois Department of Public Health.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests the
Illinois General Assembly and Governor Patrick Quinn to immediately restore funding for the Local
Health Protection Grant in the proposed FY 2010 IDPH budget and that the Cook County Department of
Public Health forward a copy of this resolution to each member of the Illinois General Assembly
representing citizens of Cook County and to Governor Quinn for their consideration.

TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Kaleidoscope,
Inc., Chicago, Illinois, to provide temporary shelter care.
Reason:

In response to significant overcrowding in the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center in the
1990's the Circuit Court of Cook County developed a continuum of juvenile detention
alternatives for court-involved youth and over the past fourteen years has contracted
for temporary shelter care as part of this continuum. In response to the Request for Proposal

Kaleidoscope, Inc. will be responsible for the recruitment and selection of qualified shelter
care homes; for the training of the responsible adults in the shelter care homes; and the
general administration and oversight of the programs and services.
Kaleidoscope, Inc. is recommended based upon a RFP. Kaleidoscope, Inc. was uniquely
responsive to the special needs of females in need of temporary shelter care.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $547,614.00 (FY 2009: $44,887.00; FY 2010: $270,817.00; and FY 2011:
$231,910.00). Contract period: October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2011. (326-298 Account).

ITEM #98
APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 26, 2009 from
EARL L. DUNLAP, Transitional Administrator, Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Chicago Uniform
Company, Chicago, Illinois, for purchase of staff uniforms and other accessories for employees. These
uniforms and accessories shall include short and long sleeved shirts, pants, sweaters, badge wallets, etc.
provided in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the Teamsters Local 714. Under
the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between Teamsters Local 714 and Cook County all
JTDC counselors, supervisors, security officers, transportation staff, food service workers, custodial
workers, laundry workers and cooks are entitled to an annual uniform allowance.
Reason:

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator, 99 C
3945 Doe v. Cook County, the Office of the Transitional Administrator instituted a new
uniform policy in fiscal year 2008 for Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC)
employees. To expedite the purchasing process for this new requirement, the Office of the
Transitional Administrator, in its authority as established in the Court Order entered
on August 14, 2007, selected Chicago Uniform Company on a sole source basis to provide
staff with the necessary uniform attire as required at the JTDC in a timely manner.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $275,000.00 (FY 2009: $75,000.00; and FY 2010: $200,000.00). Contract
period: April 15, 2009 through July 31, 2010. (569-260 320 Account). Requisition No. 95690067.

ITEM #99

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 26, 2009 from
EARL L. DUNLAP, Transitional Administrator, Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Derby Industries, South
Bend, Indiana, for the purchase of mattresses. (See related Item # 100).
Reason:

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the agreed order appointing a transitional administrator, 99 C 3945
Doe v. Cook County, the Office of the Transitional Administrator, in its authority as
established by the Court Order entered on August 14, 2007, is selecting Derby Industries as
the sole-source vendor for institutional mattresses. Derby Industries will provide durable
mattresses for use by the residents. Currently residents at the JTDC are destroying the
mattresses that have historically been used at the facility. In addition, these mattresses pose
health risks, as the residents can use some of the materials from the mattresses as weapons,
which could cause harm to other residents and employees of the JTDC. Additionally, the
residents have torn the mattresses in order to conceal contraband and other unauthorized items
in their rooms. The Derby mattresses have been piloted on several of the living units at the
JTDC and have been proven to be virtually indestructible. The purchase of these mattresses
will result in a cost savings for the JTDC, as mattress purchases will be reduced due to the
durability of the Derby mattress. Other mattress companies have provided product samples
for use at the JTDC in addition to Derby Industries, and none of their products were as
durable as the Derby mattress.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $175,000.00. Contract period: August 1, 2009 through July 31, 2010. (569333 Account). Requisition No. 95690068.

communities victimized by these youth. This contract is fully funded by the Juvenile Accountability
Block Grant.
Reason:

The Village of Homewood is a grant partner for the Project Reclaim grant approved by the
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) and by this Board. The Homewood
Flossmoor Peer Jury Program is a juvenile diversion program which operates under the
auspices of the Homewood and Flossmoor Police Departments. The purpose of this program
is to address the balanced and restorative justice approach to juvenile crime by emphasizing
the issues of accountability, competency development and community safety. The goal of the
Homewood Flossmoor Peer Jury program is to provide a viable alternative to court
prosecution and conflict resolution for first time or early juvenile offenders in the south
suburban area and thereby reducing recidivism, and relieving the court system of cases that
could be more effectively resolved through an alternative dispute resolution process, such as
peer jury. The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office identified areas in need of service
across Cook County by evaluating police and Juvenile Enterprise Management System
(GEMS) reports as well as reports generated through computer mapping of juvenile crime.
One of those areas identified was the Homewood/Flossmoor area. The Village of Homewood
