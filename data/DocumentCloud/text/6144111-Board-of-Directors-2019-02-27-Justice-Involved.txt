 Patient Feedback
“My goals: get released from jail, stay clean, live a normal life, have a healthy pregnancy”
“I have received more medical care here in the past 6 months than I have in my whole life.”
“I wouldn’t have followed up for birth control on the outside, I’m glad I’m getting it done now.”
“I think it’s good for me to leave jail with birth control because I want to take time with my three
daughters and gain our bond back. I don’t need another baby until I am stable and with my life back
on track.”

16

 Patient Feedback
One woman planned to ask her judge for an extension of her stay in order to get her IUD placed
before release. Luckily, this was not needed.

“I'm an addict... and while I work on figuring that part of my life out the last thing I need is to get
pregnant. Getting a Nexplanon is the most responsible thing I've done in my life.”
"The staff and services were excellent. It really means a lot to me and will help my recovery now that
I don't have to worry about birth control."
"Getting birth control before I left CCDOC was very important to me. Now I can focus on my two
young children and getting back to school and my future. Thank you so much!”
