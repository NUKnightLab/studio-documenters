CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
T IMOTHY C . EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Central Baptist Family
Services (CBFS), Chicago, Illinois, for a pilot therapy program to be administered through the C ircuit
Court of Cook County's Ju venile Probation and Court Services Department.
Reason:

Central Baptist Family Services will provide community-based therapeutic services for up to
forty-two (42) delinquent minors who have been diagnosed with mental health disorders and
ide ntified by the court to be in need of clinical intervention. Known as Multi-Systemic
Therapy (MST), these services focus on the family unit instead of the individual minor.
T hrough combined use of well known therape utic techniques such as cognitive behavior
therapy, MST addresses the complex issues faced by multi-need families. Other essential
components of MST include evaluation adherence to defined protocols and follow up.
As an alternative to costly residential treatment facilities, MST serv ices enable eligible minors
to remain in their homes during treatment, without compromising public safety and at a
s ubstantial sav ings to taxpayers. As of January 31 , 2002, two hundred twenty three (223)
delinquent minors were placed in residential treatment facilities at an average cost of over
$200.00 per minor per day. Under the MST pilot program, the CBFS will provide services to
eligible minors for under $50.00 per minor per day, from its s ix offices in Chicago. A grant,
specifically for the MST project from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services
will reimburse Cook County $25 0,000.00 thereby resulting in a net fiscal impact to Cook
County of $ 100,000.00 for this contract.
CBFS has been selected to provide serv ices due to its demonstrated commitment to providing
quality social services to Chicago' s youth. Originating as an orphanage in 1895, CB FS is a
multi-function child we lfare agency offering a broad continuum of alternative communitybased services. CBFS is the first licensed provider of MST services in Illinois and provides
re lated services in Jefferson County, Illinois and in St. Louis, Missouri. CBFS representatives
have committed to operate the pilot program in conformance with protocols developed by the
Medical University of South Carolina, the original developer of the MST model.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $ 100,000.00. Grant funded amount: $250,000.00. Contract period: March 1,
2002 through February 28, 2003 . (326-23 7 Account). Requisition No. 23260012.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the County Purchasing
Agent be authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.
