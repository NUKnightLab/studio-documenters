 Mike Foley, Department of Sustainability, presented. Trevor McAleer inquired as to why the item is not
being processed as sole source vs. providing an RFP exemption as the item detail states the organization
is the only vendor that can provide the services. Mr. Foley said that an RFP exemption was the
procurement method used for the past 2 years and stated that he is willing to do a sole source process in
the future, as the vendor does a great job for the County and he doesn’t know of anyone else who could
provide the services. Mr. Foley stated that he does not want the project held up as information sessions
are planned for April. Mr. McAleer stated he doesn’t want to delay the project but if the vendor is the
only provider that can provide the service, his preference would be to have the vendor sign a sole source
affidavit and the Board would then approve the item as sole source or the Department needs to
competitively bid out the services. Matt Carroll asked for clarification on whether the award would have
to come back to the Board for approval. Mr. McAleer replied yes but said sometimes the vendor may not
want to sign the sole source affidavit, and as a result the department would choose an Alternative
Procurement method. Mr. Carroll asked if the Board could approve the item pending receipt of a signed
affidavit provided by the vendor. Mr. McAleer deferred the question to the Office of Procurement and
Diversity. Rich Opre stated that two processes are being discussed, one of which is to have the vendor
sign a sole source affidavit. Mr. Opre clarified that if a sole source process is utilized the item would have
to be reprocessed through the Onbase system and posted for 5 days on the County’s Website. After
further discussion the Board recommended the item be approved contingent upon the vendor submitting
a signed sole source affidavit. Andria Richardson, Clerk of the Board stated the item would have to be
amended to remove the RFP exemption language. Matt Carroll motioned to approve the item as
amended; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-243 was conditionally approved by unanimous vote.
BC2019-244
Office of Innovation and Performance,
a) Submitting an RFP exemption on RQ44920, which will result in a membership with City Innovate Inc.

b) Recommending an award on RQ44920 and enter into a contract with City Innovate Inc. in the amount
not-to-exceed $20,000.00 for participation in the Startup in Residence Program (STIR) for the period

Catherine Tkachyk, Office of Innovation and Performance, presented. Dale Miller asked if there are
potential or specific challenges the department will be providing once the County participates in the

BC2019-245
Department of Health and Human Services/Community Initiatives Division/Family and Children First

Carroll motioned to approve the item; Michael Dever seconded. Item BC2019-247 was unanimously

D. – Consent Agenda
Dale Miller referred to Item BC2019-249 and asked why the contract was being terminated; Sarah Baker,
Juvenile Court replied that the individual responsible for overseeing the training portion for the Project
did not complete any of the reporting and training. Juvenile Court informed the Ohio Supreme Court, who
provides the grant funds of the situation. The vendor refused to work with Juvenile Court to make
improvements so Juvenile Court has decided to terminate the contract with the vendor and will try to
develop the Project in-house. Mr. Miller asked how much has been paid out of the contract and asked if
the Court is doing anything to recoup those funds. Joe Nanni commented that the County has several
agencies who could make an attempt to recoup those funds, especially if the County has not received any
services. Matt Carroll asked for clarification that the County would be collecting Grant funds on behalf of
the Ohio Supreme Court.
Trevor McAleer referred to Item BC2019-251 and asked if the Reverse Auction method was used to
procure food purchases for the Jail or did the County revert back to the normal process.

 There were no further questions. Matt Carroll motioned to approve items BC2019-248 through -251;
Michael Dever seconded, the consent items were unanimously approved.
