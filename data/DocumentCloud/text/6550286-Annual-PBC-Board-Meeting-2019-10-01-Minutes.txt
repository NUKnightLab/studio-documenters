The next item presented to the Board of Commissioners for consideration of approval
was the proposed 2020 Administrative Budget for the Public Building Commission.

The

Executive Director advised the Commissioners that PBC’s primary source of funding for the
administrative budget is project administrative fees, which fluctuates as the PBC workload (work
in place or WIP) fluctuates. She reported that, since 2017, PBC has built a reserve as bond
revenue has decreased through Administrative Cost Savings. There was a visual presentation
which showed that PBC has been fiscally in line with resources and expenditures since 2017.
Also depicted was a six-year view of actual and anticipated WIP (“projects undertaken” and
“projects in planning”), summarized as follows: for 2018, $281M in projects undertaken and
$8M in planning; for 2019, $289M for anticipated WIP; for 2020, $249M with no projects in
planning; and for 2021, $97M.
She further advised the Commissioners that the proposed 2020 Public Building
Commission Administrative Budget was $9,620,487 to provide technical and professional
support for delivery of PBC’s projected program. The proposed 2020 Administrative Budget
expenses are flat as compared to the 2019 budget. As PBC identifies additional projects for 2020
and beyond, the Executive Director stated that the PBC remains committed to a balanced budget
and will focus on the priorities set by the Board and to the effective delivery of high-quality
facilities on behalf of its clients.
After discussion and consideration, and upon motion duly made and seconded, the
proposed 2020 Public Building Commission of Chicago Consolidated Administrative Expense
Budget was unanimously approved and is attached hereto collectively as Exhibit “B”.

The next item presented to the Board of Commissioners for consideration of approval
was the proposed 2020 Operating and Capital Budget for the Richard J. Daley Center. The
Executive Director advised the Commissioners that the proposed Daley Center operating budget
for 2020 is $16,530,895, which represents a modest increase of 3.83% over the 2019 budget.
The overall goals for the Daley Center during 2020 are to pursue new energy conservation
measures, enhance building safety and emergency preparedness, and increase minority
participation through operating and capital expenditures. Life safety/threat and ADA assessments
conducted during 2019 yielded several new projects that will be included in the operating and
capital budget for 2020. The capital budget for 2020 includes $5,290,000 for capital projects
such as: Building Automation System upgrades, façade and louver repairs, ADA upgrades and
repairs to the Clark Street stairway. After discussion and upon motion duly made and seconded,

3. Richard J. Daley Center Operating and Capital Budget

The PBC, through its building manager, MB Real Estate, develops an annual Budget to
cover the operating and maintenance costs for the Daley Center, as well as a Budget
for capital projects which support in maintaining and upgrading the 54-year old
facility. The Daley Center Operating and Capital Budgets are approved at the PBC’s
Annual Meeting. Both components are allocated amongst its tenants: Cook County,
the City of Chicago, and the PBC based on the square footage of space each occupies.
The proposed Operating Budget for 2020 is $16,530,895 which is a 3.83% increase
over the 2019 budget.
For 2020, costs savings in the operating budget are expected to result from lower
projected costs for metal maintenance, carpet and window replacements. Projected
increases stem from annual increases to union cleaning and engineering wages, along
with increases associated with the new elevator maintenance contract. Security
expense increases are due to the additional coverage required for package screening
at the dock level.
The resulting rental rate is $12.97 per square foot, an extremely competitive rate given
the location and landmark quality of the building when compared to similar types of
buildings in the Loop.

 Public Building Commission

2020 Annual Budget Executive Summary
Introduction
The Public Building Commission of Chicago and MB Real Estate Services Inc are pleased to
present the 2020 Operating and Capital Budget for the Richard, J. Daley Center. The 2020
operating expense budget of $16,530,895 reflects an increase of 3.83% over the 2019 Budget
of $15,921,651.
The 3.83% increase in operating expenses equates to $609,247 and is a result of annual
increases to union cleaning and engineering wages, along with increases associated with the
new elevator maintenance contract. Additionally, security expense increases are due to the
additional coverage required for package screening services at the dock level. These
increases are primarily offset by lower projected costs for metal maintenance, carpet
replacement and window replacements.
The Percentage for Operating Expense Allocation for 2018 are as follows: Cook County –
95.88%, City of Chicago – 0.348% and Public Building Commission - 3.76%.
Operating Goals
The overall goals for 2020 are to pursue new energy conservation measures, bolster building
safety and emergency preparedness, while increasing minority participation through
operating and capital expenditures. The building conducted life safety/threat and ADA
assessments in 2019 which have yielded several new projects that will be included within the
building’s operating and capital budget in 2020.
In 2019, the building pursued BOMA’s 360 certification and is making strides for a
submittal for BOMA’s TOBY awards in 2020. To achieve these goals, we plan on
undertaking the following projects:
•

Cleaning RFP:
Cleaning services will be competitively bid to minority firms and will include annual
maintenance of the Picasso, which has historically been maintained outside of the
cleaning contract. The new cleaning contract will also require the vendor to align
cleaning schedules with the building automation system to preserve energy.

•

Security Services RFP:
Security services will be competitively bid with a minority participation requirement
of 40%. The new security services contract will include new coverages for package
screening at the dock level, updated emergency response plans, tenant emergency
training and emergency response videos customized for the building.

•

MBE/WBE Participation:
In efforts of increasing the building’s minority participation levels for both operating
and capital expenses, there are several steps that will be taken. First, we will work
closely with several organizations that support minority business to solicit interest for
projects within the building. Secondly, we plan to host an open house for minority
vendors to review all building services and ongoing capital improvement plan.

PROPOSED 2020
BUDGET

1. See Electrical Budget Worksheet based on utility consultant usage projections and existing procurement rates.
2. See Natural Gas Budget based on utility consultant usage projections and existing procurement rates.
3. See Natural Gas Budget Worksheet (2019 Budget Tenant Steam Cost). Includes all costs for City Hall and County Building steam usage.
These costs are offset against the overall utility expense category.
Also, includes reconciliation performed for 2018 steam usage. Additional charges owed by City and County totals $166K and will be added to 2020 steam charges.
Variance is due to reconciliation credits or charges that vary from year to year based on City Hall/County Bldg usage.
4. See Water Budget Worksheet.
Variance stems from increase in City of Chicago Water/Sewer tax rates and overall usage.
5. Energy Performance Contracting Loan (March 2011 through September 2025). Payments due in March and September. Funded by savings created and applied to utility and
maintenance expenses.
