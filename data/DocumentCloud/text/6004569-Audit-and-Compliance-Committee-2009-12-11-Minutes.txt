Report from System Corporate Compliance Officer
Cathy Bodner, System Corporate Compliance Officer, presented a report (Attachment #1) that included
information on the following: status report of 4th quarter activity, revisiting the elements of a compliance
program, general and specialty compliance – education and training activity, and activity on additional
elements.
During the discussion of education and training, Ms. Bodner noted that one important element that she found
was missing is the compliance attestation. The attestation states that the individual will take the responsibility
for completing the training, and attests that they will conform to the System’s standards of conduct. That will
be completed now with new employee orientations, and also with annual orientations. She added that, in the
future, this will be tracked electronically.
On the subject of attestation, Director Greenspan inquired regarding the penalties for non-compliance. Ms.
Bodnar responded that penalties have not yet been determined; discussions must be held with the Department of
Human Resources on the subject.
In response to a question from Chairman Muñoz regarding electronic programs for corporate compliance
training and tracking, Ms. Bodnar responded that she expects to bring in that resource in May 2010. This
resource will do the training, attestation and tracking electronically.
Director Greenspan referenced a subject that was recently discussed in the Finance Committee. This was
regarding the System’s requirement, as set forth in the Procurement Policy, which directs the Purchasing
Department to track ex parte communications. Further discussion took place regarding standards of conduct,
future activities and areas to address.

Report from System Director of Internal Audit
A. Building an Internal Audit Function
Thomas Schroeder, System Director of Internal Audit, presented a report on building an internal audit
function (Attachment #2). The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Chairman Muñoz inquired regarding the estimated date of completion for the internal audit charter. Mr.
Schroeder responded that he has drafted an internal audit charter; once the Audit and Compliance
Committee charter is approved, the approval of the internal audit charter will follow.
The Committee briefly discussed the 2010 budget for Internal Audit. Mr. Schroeder provided information
on the subject. Chairman Muñoz noted that a discussion should be held on the subject at the next Audit and
Compliance Committee meeting, in order to ensure that there is budgetary support to be able to meet the
expectations and goals set for 2010.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Minutes of the Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting, October 13, 2009, recessed and
reconvened October 15, 2009
Director Greenspan, seconded by Chairman Muñoz, moved to accept the minutes of the Audit and
Compliance Committee Meeting of October 13, 2009, recessed and reconvened October 15, 2009. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Proposed Charter for the Audit and Compliance Committee of the CCHHS Board of Directors
Ms. Bodnar and Mr. Schroeder introduced the draft charter to the Committee. Ms. Bodnar proposed that
the members review this document and provide input, so that a final document can be presented for
approval at the next Committee meeting.
Director Greenspan made a suggestion for the Purpose section. Rather than limiting it to the financial
integrity and controls system of financial reporting, there should be a statement in the Purpose section
stating that the System’s goal is to establish an environment of integrity.

C. Proposed System Corporate Compliance Program’s mission and vision statement
Ms. Bodnar introduced the draft System Corporate Compliance Program’s mission and vision statement.
After discussion, Chairman Muñoz stated that the members should review this document and provide input,
so that a final document can be presented for approval at the next Committee meeting. Ms. Bodnar noted
that this draft includes input received from the ad hoc Work Group on Corporate Compliance.
Director Greenspan stated that there is a perception of self-interest at many levels, rather than of public
interest; one of the tasks of the Board is to overcome that perception. Therefore, there should be a positive
statement included which states, for example, that the purpose of the Compliance Program is to support the
mission of the System, and to establish the public’s interest as primary.

E. Update from RSM McGladrey on status of internal audits
Pat Kitchen and Tim Heinrich, of RSM McGladrey, presented an update on the status of the internal audits
(Attachment #4). The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Chairman Muñoz requested additional information with regard to information technology security. Mr.
Kitchen stated that the focus is really around the general security environment and controls around access;
this is to ensure that both the physical access and the information security access is appropriately controlled.
Mr. Heinrich noted that they are still in the process of testing; he provided additional information on the
scope of the audit.

will be available on Tuesday, December 15th.
Ms. Guidry reminded the Committee that back in July, they were given a draft management letter for their
review. There is another version of that letter now; it contains the same comments, however, it now
includes management’s responses.
Chairman Muñoz requested that Ms. Guidry provide a brief summary of material weaknesses. Ms. Guidry
stated that there is a repeat finding from the prior year; it relates to timeliness of financial reporting.

Subject:

Proposal to Modify the Charge to Ad Hoc Work Group

Background
At the November 17, 2008 Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors
of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, discussion of the creation of an Ad
Hoc Work Group on Corporate Compliance occurred. Once created, this group,
coordinated by Dr. Carolyn Lopez and composed of Chicago area professionals that are
either compliance program stakeholders or experts in corporate compliance, was charged
with assisting, as needed, in the efforts to bring a Corporate Compliance Officer on board
and developing the CCHHS compliance program structure and, once developed, create an
implementation plan. The group, through the coordinator, would report to the Committee
the work plan and progress of the work plan tasks.
Original Charge
In January 2009, the charge of the Ad Hoc Work Group was formalized. Details follow,
 To develop a corporate compliance plan for the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System (CCHHS) that is current, comprehensive, relevant, and
containing all the essential elements of a strong and effective plan.
 To create an implementation plan that will include
− A plan for initial and follow-up training for all affected employees
− A plan for monitoring and ensuring that all affected employees complete
initial and follow-up training in a timely manner
The Work Group shall function in partnership with CCHHS leaders and staff in
completing its charge.
Proposal
In September 2009, CCHHS hired Cathy Bodnar as the Chief Compliance Officer. In
light of this action, the Ad Hoc Work Group on Corporate Compliance and the Chief

Page 29 of 33

 Audit & Compliance Committee Memorandum
Page 2
Compliance Officer request the Audit and Compliance Committee thoughtfully consider
the following proposal to modify the original charge.
The Ad Hoc Work Group on Corporate Compliance is charged with providing direction
to the system compliance program. Responsibilities include providing oversight on
unrestricted compliance program activities; this includes, but is not limited to, guidance
on the mission and vision of the compliance program, the CCHHS code of ethics/
standard of conduct, compliance communications, and education and training for the
community in general along with Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS)
personnel1.
1

CCHHS personnel is defined as including officers, directors, members of
committees with Board-delegated authority, employees, and members of the
CCHHS medical staff or house staff, researchers, students and agency personnel.
This would also apply to independent contractors, consultants and other business
partners (vendors) who are not employees but are working at CCHHS.
