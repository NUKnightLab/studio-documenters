Group Exemption Number:
8510

Dear Sir or Madam:

This is in response to your request of November 19, 2003 regarding a copy of your organization's group
exemption letter.

In January 1978 we issued a determination letter that recognized your organization as exempt from federal
income tax. Our records indicate that your organization is currently exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the
internal Revenue Code.

Based on the information supplied, we recognized the subordinates named on the list your organization
submitted as exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Code. Additionally, we have
classi?ed the subordinates your organization operates, supervises, or controls, and which are covered by
written noti?cation to us, as organizations that are not private foundations because they are organizations of
the type described in sections 509(a)( 1) and 170(b)(1 of the Code.

Donors may deduct contributions to your organization's subordinates as provided in section 170 of the Code.
Bequests, legacies, devises, transfers or gifts to the subordinates or for their use are deductible for federal
estate and gift tax purposes if they meet the applicable provisions of sections 2055, 2106, and 2522 of the
Code. .

Your organization and its subordinates are required to ?le Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from
Income Tax, only if the gross receipts each year are normally more than $25,000. if a return is required, it must
be filed by the 15th day of the ?fth month after the end of the organization's annual accounting period. The law
imposes a penalty of $20 a day, up to a maximum of $10,000, when a return is ?led late, unless there is
reasonable cause for the delay.

Your organization and its subordinates are not required to file federal income tax returns unless subject to the
tax on unrelated business income under section 511 of the Code. If subject to this tax, the organization must
?le an income tax return on Form 990-T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return. In this letter, we
are not determining whether any of your organization or its subordinates' present or proposed activities are
unrelated trade or business as de?ned in section 513 of the Code.

Arthritis Foundation
58-1 341679

Unless specifically excepted, your organization and its subordinates are liable for taxes under the Federal

Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No.231 Michael E. Williams, request to vacate Burgess Street
between Lyndon and Acacia.

Petition NO. 231 Michael E. Williams to outright vacate and subsequently revised to
temporary close Burgess Avenue, 50 feet wide, from Acacia Avenue, 60 feet wide, to the
east-west alley, 18 feet wide, ?rst south of Lyndon Avenue.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility
review) and report. This is our report.

The request is being made by the property owners located on Burgess. The area is subject
tO crime, including illegal dumping. The property owners have been issued citations and
charged with the removal of the debris discarded by others. There is also a problem with
stolen cars being stripped and abandoned on the block. The residents would like to improve
the block and allow only pedestrian traf?c by blocking both ends of the block with planters
and maintaining a green space on the block.

The Department of Public Works (DPW) objects to the closure because there are residents
serviced with garbage pickup by DPW. There are also concerns regarding access for
residents, emergency vehicles, and maintenance vehicles for city-owned lots. Street closure
has been an ineffective method for prevention of illegal dumping. DPW will consider
installing surveillance cameras on Burgess, as well as ensuring that the street is regularly
monitored for any necessary debris removal.

Flaming and Development Department Objects to the closure. The Department of
Neighborhoods has been contacted and will follow-up with the petitioner to address the
dumping issue in the neighborhood. supports addressing this important issue, but
does not support the street closure.

The request was approved by all other involved City Departments and utility companies
provided that easement access the full Width of the street is reservedLIL- 13:33 bill?[Z #3313 

 

 

City Engineering Division DPW concludes that Burgess Avenue should remain an open
public right-of-way and respectfully recommends DENIAL of this petition request.
