HONORING DR. WILLIE WILSON FOR THE CREATION OF A
JOINT PUBLIC-PRIVATE INITIATIVE TO PAY THE BOND FOR
NON-VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND SUPPORT THEIR REINTEGRATION
INTO THE COMMUNITY
WHEREAS, Dr. Willie Wilson grew up in Louisiana and moved to Chicago in 1965, where he went to
work for McDonald’s Corporation and ultimately began to build a multi-million dollar business; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Wilson is an outstanding mentor for Cook County citizens, as he has for years been among
the top philanthropists in Chicago and lifted himself out of poverty to build his business; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Wilson bailed out six non-violent detainees from the Cook County Jail in September of
2016; and
WHEREAS, those six (6) individuals were being held for minor offenses and could not make bail, meaning
they would have remained in the Cook County Jail until their trial ended; and
WHEREAS, in November of 2016, Dr. Wilson plans to use $50,000.00 of his own money to bail out nonviolent offenders so they will be able to spend this Thanksgiving with their families; and
WHEREAS, this is the latest in a long line of philanthropic efforts Dr. Wilson has made to improve life for
Chicagoans and residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Corrections facilities currently hold about 300 inmates who are only
incarcerated because they cannot afford to pay their bond; and
WHEREAS, the bond amount for the aforementioned individuals is $1,000.00 or less; and
WHEREAS, approximately 55 percent of these individuals are currently being held on misdemeanor
charges that carry a maximum imprisonment penalty of 364 days in a County Detention Facility; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Wilson’s selfless act in September of 2016 has saved taxpayers thousands of dollars, and
his similarly planned initiative for Thanksgiving will save much more; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners applauds Dr. Wilson’s efforts, and his actions have
sparked a real debate about reforming the monetary bail system in Illinois.
