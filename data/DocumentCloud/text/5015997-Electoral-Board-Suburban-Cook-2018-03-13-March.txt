of a much broader, history of lynching in America, a vicious tool of racial control to suppress black civil
rights. Doria established the Anthony Crawford foundation in his name; his heart-rending story and those
of so many others provided the focus to her life’s work. On October 21, 2016, on the Centennial of his
tragic death, she lead a pilgrimage of scholars, justice advocates, faith leaders and artists from across the
country to a two day event entitled “Justice for Anthony Crawford, Freedom School and Speak Out.” She
worked with Public Interest Attorney Bryan Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative to establish one of
the few historical markers in the country dedicated to lynching, marking the site of her great-grandfather’s
death; and
WHEREAS, Doria Dee Johnson spent her academic and professional life examining the deeply complex
and troubled story of the African American experience; she received her Bachelor of General Studies in
