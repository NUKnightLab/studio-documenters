PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
Department(s):

Resource Management

Summary: Powderhorn Marsh and Prairie Nature Preserve received Bronze Accreditation through
Chicago Wilderness’ Excellence in Ecological Restoration Program (“EERP”).
The Chicago Wilderness Excellence in Ecological Restoration Program (EERP) is a program designed to
recognize high-quality restoration sites and develop professional standards of excellence in natural resource
management and ecological restoration. The primary purpose of the EERP is to promote best management
practices in order to improve ecological restoration management efforts in the Chicago region and across
the nation. The Program combines a rigorous, standards-based approach with a voluntary, comprehensive
assessment process to recognize high-quality sites and the organizations that manage them.

BOARD AGENDA

March 11, 2014

The benefits of participating in the EERP go beyond simply restoring the ecological health of a particular
site. Participation in the EERP provides agencies with opportunities for self-assessment and demonstrates
on the ground commitment to Chicago Wilderness’s Biodiversity Recovery Plan. It also provides an
opportunity to update and clarify policies and procedures in order to ensure that demonstrated practices are
in alignment with existing policies and procedures. The EERP outlines professional standards for both
internal and external comparisons, thereby raising the credibility for agencies engaged in restoring sites.
Powderhorn Marsh and Prairie Nature Preserve is a 192-acre preserve located in the Calumet region of
southeastern Cook County, primarily in the Village of Burnham but with select portions within the Chicago
city limits. Lying within the Lake Michigan watershed, the site is a remarkable remnant of dune-and-swale
habitat and a shallow, naturalized lake. It has been identified as an Illinois Natural Areas Inventory site, and
130 acres are dedicated as a State Nature Preserve by the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission.
Powderhorn Marsh and Prairie Nature Preserve holds significant biodiversity and six state-listed plant and
animal species. The site reflects the unusual plant communities’ characteristic of sandy dune-and-swale
remnants: black oak barrens, dry, mesic, and wet sand prairies, sedge meadows, and emergent wetlands.
Because of its proximity to Lake Michigan, Powderhorn Marsh and Prairie Nature Preserve is also
recognized and managed as a critical migratory bird stop-over site.

PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
Department(s):

Resource Management

Summary: The Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “Preserves”) has won Conservation and
Native Landscaping awards which recognizes sites and projects within the Chicago region that
demonstrates exemplary use of native landscaping ecosystem restoration and protection. The awards are
for the following sites:
Edgebrook Woods Demonstration Site
In 2007, Friends of the Chicago River partnered with the Preserves to establish long-term restoration
practices at Edgebrook Woods, located along the North Branch of the Chicago River in Chicago. The
partners created a site management plan to improve the riverbank and upland conditions and address the
impacts of storm water runoff. Friends of the Chicago River organized volunteer workdays to remove
non-native plants, create multiple rain gardens, collect and disperse local native seeds, establish new
habitats, and monitor species. Since 2007, more than 1,300 volunteers have logged approximately 5,000
hours and learned simple at-home actions they can take to manage storm water.
Thatcher Woods Savanna Restoration Project
A tiny remnant with a once small and closed savanna, Thatcher Woods Savanna is now a thriving five-acre
prairie and open savanna with rebounding plant populations. The Preserves restored the site by removing
invasive buckthorn, conducting prescribed burns, and monitoring rare plant species. The Thatcher complex
has more than 250 native plant species and includes one of the only remaining examples of quality
floodplain forest left in the Northeastern Morainal Division of Illinois. For surrounding suburban
communities such as River Forest and Melrose Park, Thatcher Woods provides a refuge and a place for
walking and learning about nature, especially when interpreted by the naturalists at the nearby Hal Tyrrell
Trailside Museum of Natural History. As habitat continues to improve, the experience will only grow richer
for visitors.

Theodore Stone Preserve
After 20 years of restoration, Theodore Stone Preserve-a formerly degraded woodland and brushed-over
prairie-now supports a spectacular mix of restored remnant mesic oak woodland, mesic prairie, dolomite
prairie, and marshland communities. In part because of its rare dolomite prairie, the 135-acre preserve is a
natural area of regional importance and is home to several threatened and endangered species. Several years
ago, the Preserves worked with the Village of Hodgkins, Friends of the Forest Preserves and others to
eliminate parking lot runoff that had created a 20-foot-deep erosion gully through one of the preserve’s
wooded bluffs and was polluting the dolomite prairie below. The Preserves then filled the gully and
restored the area. Staff, contractors, and extremely dedicated volunteers undertook intense restoration
efforts, and Theodore Stone Preserve now plays a role in improved air and water quality as well as flood
control, provides opportunities for outdoor recreation and respite, conserves critical habitat for wildlife,
increases local property values, and raises the overall quality of life for people who live and work in the
area.

5-2A-3: TERM OF LICENSE.
All licenses issued to entities that fall into this category will be issued for up to a ten-year term,
unless otherwise approved by the Board based upon Forest Preserve staff recommendations for a
license exceeding twenty-five acres and/or when in staff opinion the license can generate additional
revenue for the Forest Preserves. Said term will commence when said license is executed by the
President of the Board of Forest Preserve District Commissioners.
5-2A-4: LICENSE FEE.
In addition to those special fees as may be recommended by Forest Preserve staff, Tthe fee for
licenses issued under this Article will be determined by multiplying the acres used by the cost per
acre. Acres used will be calculated by multiplying the linear footage shown on the license
application (or revised application) by the width required for future maintenance of the facilities.
The minimum width will be fifteen (15) feet for all licenses regardless of the facilities installed or
location of said facilities. Requests for widths above fifteen (15) feet must include an explanation
justifying the need for additional width. The minimum license fee will be five (5) percent of the
cost per acre for the current year. Additionally, a Youth Education, Land Acquisition and
Restoration (YELAR) Program Fee of five (5) percent of the cost per acre shall be assessed against
all licenses issued. Cost per acre, minimum license fee and YELAR program fee figures can be
found in Appendix A at the end of this Article. All fees due will be paid as a lump-sum up-front
one-time payment, unless otherwise approved by the Board.

5-2A-6: RENEWAL OF EXISTING LICENSES.
Any license previously issued by the FPD that expires while this Article is in force will be renewed
at a rate fifty (50) percent lower than that specified for issuance of a new license, unless otherwise
approved by the Board based upon Forest Preserve staff recommendations for a license exceeding
twenty-five acres and/or when in staff opinion the license can generate additional revenue for the
Forest Preserves. The minimum renewal license fee will be five (5) percent of the cost per acre for
the current year. Additionally, a Youth Education, Land Acquisition and Restoration (YELAR)
Program Fee of five (5) percent of the cost per acre shall be assessed against all licenses issued.
Cost per acre, minimum license fee and YELAR program fee figures can be found in Appendix A
at the end of this Article. The Licensee must submit a non-refundable license renewal application
fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to the FPD six (6) months prior to the expiration date of said
license to confirm its interest in continued operation and maintenance of the facilities for which the
license was originally issued. If the applicable license renewal application fee and prior notice of

the Licensee's intent to renew is not received by the FPD at least six (6) months prior to the
expiration of the existing license, the FPD will mail the Licensee a "Removal Notice" at their last
known address notifying the licensee to remove their facilities from FPD property. If the Licensee
wishes to renew a license for which it has already received a "Removal Notice" the FPD will allow
the renewal but the fee for the renewal will be based on the formula used to determine the fee for
issuance of a new license. All fees due for license renewals will be paid as a lump-sum upfront
one-time payment, unless otherwise approved by the Board.
5-2A-7: EXPIRATION OF THIS ARTICLE.
This Article will expire on December 31, 2014 2024. Any license previously issued by the FPD that

be automatically renewed for one (1) period(s) until a replacement Article is adopted. The fee for
any extended year period shall be calculated as established in paragraph 5-2A-4 using a cost per
acre of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) higher than the previous year.

Article B. Municipalities and Other Governmental Agencies
….
5-2B-3: TERM OF LICENSE.
All licenses issued to entities that fall into this category will be issued for a continuous term, unless
otherwise approved by the Board based upon Forest Preserve staff recommendations when in staff
opinion the license can generate additional revenue for the Forest Preserve. Said term will
commence when said license is executed by the President of the Board of Forest Preserve District
Commissioners and would continue as long as the licensee complies with the terms and conditions
set forth in the license. Any License not issued for a continuous term may be renewed in
accordance with Title 5-2A-6 of this Code.
5-2B-4: LICENSE FEE.
In addition to those special fees as may be recommended by Forest Preserve staff, Tthe fee for
licenses issued under this Article will be determined by multiplying the acres used by the cost per
acre. Acres used will be calculated by multiplying the linear footage shown on the license
application (or revised application) by the width required for future maintenance of the facilities.
