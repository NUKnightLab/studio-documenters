Section 208 of the Clean Water Act

• NOACA is required to maintain and update the region’s 208 Plan
• Federal wastewater permits and funding cannot conflict

Facility Planning Areas (FPAs)

• Consist of FPA boundaries and prescriptions for wastewater
treatment (prescriptions)
• FPA boundaries = planning areas associated with public
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
• Prescriptions = local options for wastewater treatment

 FPA MODIFICATIONS

• 53 FPA approved modifications since 2009
• 42% for new development

Current FPA Modification Policies
