Sponsored by: TONI PRECKWINKLE, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
IN SUPPORT OF THE WHITE HOUSE’S DATA DRIVEN JUSTICE INITIATIVE
WHEREAS, in July 2016 the White House launched the Data Driven Justice Initiative which focuses on
utilizing “data-driven strategies to divert low-level offenders with mental illness out of the criminal
justice system and change approaches to pre-trial incarceration, so that low-risk offenders no longer stay
in jail simply because they cannot afford a bond”; and
WHEREAS, “these innovative strategies, which have measurably reduced jail populations in several
communities, help stabilize individuals and families, better serve communities, and often save money in
the process”; and
WHEREAS, the Data Driven Initiative is supported by a coalition of 67 city, county, and state
governments; and
WHEREAS, the bipartisan coalition includes the state of Illinois, Champaign County, Lake County, and
McLean County, Illinois as well as Los Angeles County California, Miami-Dade County Florida,
Ramsey County, Minnesota, Mecklenburg County North Carolina, Camden County New Jersey, Bexar
County Texas, King County Washington, Denver Colorado and New York, New York; and

BOARD AGENDA

August 3, 2016

WHEREAS, the Data Driven Initiative “encourages communities to implement strategies proven to be
effective in reducing unnecessary incarceration in jails such as using data to identify and proactively
break the cycle of incarceration, specifically to bring data together from across criminal justice and
health systems to identify individuals with the highest number of contacts with police, ambulance,
emergency departments, and other services, and link them to health, behavioral health, and social
services in the community, with a goal of reducing overreliance on emergency healthcare and encounters
with the criminal justice system”; and,
WHEREAS, “the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority and the Illinois Health & Hospital
Association have committed to collaborating to host a convening of participating and interested Illinois
counties to help identify opportunities for engagement with hospitals and relevant stakeholders at the
local level to share best practices to reduce hospital readmissions and preventable emergency-room
visits, and improve health”; and,
WHEREAS, the National Association of Counties (NACo), The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation and the National Alliance on Mental Illness have committed to working with the White
House Data Driven Initiative;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners support the White House Data Driven Initiative and encourage Cook County
government’s public safety stakeholders, namely the offices of the Chief Judge, Clerk of the Circuit
Court, Public Defender, Sheriff and State’s Attorney as well as the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System to work collaboratively through the Cook County Justice Advisory Council to further the goals of
the initiative.

BOARD AGENDA

August 3, 2016

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent on 5/4/2016 that additional funds would be needed in this account. The balance on
5/4/2016 was $39,267.00
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
These accounts were chosen to be used for the sources of funds because of the amount of unencumbered
balances available.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account is budgeted annually in order to ensure adequate funds are available to cover various external
initiatives. OCPO identified partnerships to minimize the cost and enhance ongoing collaborative efforts.

Presented by: ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Department of Revenue
Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: Funds will be used to purchase cigarette tax stamps. The previous vendor no longer provides
printing of stamps and there is an increased cost with the new vendor. Annually, cigarette tax generates an
estimated $134 million. Also, funds will be used for equipment and computer supplies needed for the
Collections, Compliance and Audit divisions. The current equipment being used is more than 5 years old
and operates at substantially low speed. Replacement of the outdated desktops is required to efficiently
work with CCDOR’s Integrated Tax Processing System (ITPS).

From Account(s): 007- 260, $100,000.00
To Account(s): 007-240, $30,000.00; 007-388, $70,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $100,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that the receiving account would require and infusion of funds in Q2. The cost of
printing the stamps is more than anticipated due to the fact that the original vendor no longer provides
these services.
It became apparent that updated computer equipment would be necessary to run the ITPS system at the
start of implementation of the project. In Q2 the department recognized that the performances on the
existing machines are extremely slow and they are no longer compatible with updated software,
additionally the life-cycle of the equipment has ended.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The department identified areas of efficiencies and process improvements that resulted in unused funds.
The primary account used for professional services that are no longer required
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Originally, the department appropriated funds for a vendor to provide consulting and integration services
related to the implementation of our Integrated Tax Processing System. However, the department no
longer requires the services of the vendor as we have worked with Bureau of Technology to provide an
internal solution that meets the project needs and accomplished the integration necessary between the
cashiering and tax processing system.

The grant reimburses the county for activities performed during the 2016 state fiscal year. A delegation
agreement was previously agreed upon by both the IEPA and the Cook County Board (Board Agenda Item
15-3606 from 07/29/2015), grant funding was delayed due to the state budget impasse. Illinois EPA has
delegated its authority to inspect solid waste management facilities to several county agencies, the Ambraw
Valley Solid Waste Agency (for Crawford, Richland and Lawrence Counties) and the City of Chicago.
Delegated agencies are authorized to conduct many of the duties within their political boundaries that would

Presented by: JESSICA CAFFREY, Director, Real Estate Management Division
PROPOSED SALE OR PURCHASE OF REAL ESTATE
Department(s): Department of Real Estate Management
Other Part(ies): City of Des Plaines, Des Plaines, Illinois
Request: Approval of an Intergovernmental Agreement for sale of County excess land to the City of
Des Plaines
Description of Real Estate: Subject property consists of approximately 922 square feet or + 0.002 acre
in Cook County District #17, located south of I-90 and west of the Canadian National Railroad right of
way
Section: W ½ SW ¼ Section: 33-41-12
Parcel(s): DOTH Excess Land EL #444
Fiscal Impact: Revenue Generating
Accounts: (MFT) Motor Fuel Tax Account
Summary: The City of Des Plaines has notified the Real Estate Director that it desires to acquire the
subject property from the County and an adjacent parcel from the Illinois Toll Authority in order to
provide a parcel of land owned by the Rosemont Park District easement access through a private
development to the Mannheim and Higgins Road rights of way.
Pursuant to Cook County Code Chapter 66, Section 66-2 (the “Surplus Property Ordinance”), the Cook
County Department of Transportation and Highways has determined that this property is “surplus.” The
Department of Real Estate Management has determined that the subject property is not needed for other
County purposes, and is not commercially marketable. This determination is based upon the very small
size of the parcel, the lack of street access, and the adjacency of the parcel to the railroad right of way.
Based on an appraisal obtained by the Illinois Toll Authority for the adjacent parcel, the City of Des
Plaines has agreed to pay the County $5,071.00 for the subject parcel. This price is within the range of
fair market value.
It is requested that this Honorable Body declare the subject property to be “excess” and authorize the
conveyance of the property by approval of the IGA attached hereto, and that the President of the Board
or the Director of the Department of Real Estate Management be authorized to execute and deliver a quit
claim deed for the subject parcel in exchange for the purchase price of $5,071.00.

The ACT Court is a drug court probation program that operates in the Circuit Court Criminal Division.
Its goal is to help certain nonviolent, felony criminal offenders suffering from substance abuse problems
from becoming repeat offenders and being incarcerated. The program links participants with behavioral
health, vocational, and educational treatment services from community-based sources. The court closely
monitors participants’ compliance with program protocols and provides encouragement for success
through a range of rewards and sanctions. Incarceration is used as a last resort and for short periods. The
annual service goal for the ACT Court is 170 participants.
The Circuit Court’s ARI HOPE Court is a structured probation program that operates in the Circuit
Court’s Municipal District One (City of Chicago). The ARI HOPE judge and team work to give
offenders the support and services they need to complete their probation sentence and move toward
productive lives. Offenders who qualify are diverted from the Illinois Department of Corrections into the
program which combines intensive probation supervision with cognitive behavioral therapy,
trauma-based treatment, and substance abuse treatment. Additional community-based social services,
such as housing and vocational services, are also offered as part of the program. The court closely
monitors participants’ compliance with program protocols and provides encouragement for success
through a range of rewards and sanctions. Incarceration is used as a last resort and for short periods. The
annual service goal for the ARI-HOPE Court is 300 participants.
