Report from Interim Director of Human Resources (continued)

With regard to the recruitment efforts for the higher priority positions, such as nursing positions, Director
Carvalho asked if there is a way for the Committee to determine whether the recruitment efforts are
emphasizing nursing positions, in contrast with the total number of vacancies filled System-wide, based upon
the information provided to them. Ms. Schneider provided an example reflecting the focus of recruitment
efforts for higher priority positions. Due to a significant number of retirements that took place in December,
twenty-eight (28) beds in the Medical-Surgical unit were closed, in order to provide safe staffing levels. Since
then, the nursing staff needed to re-open the beds have been hired, and all of the beds have since re-opened.
As this meeting will be the last Human Resources Committee Meeting for Chairman Lyne, due to her term
expiring on June 30th, Ms. Lopez took the opportunity to acknowledge and thank Chairman Lyne for her
support, contributions and commitment that she has made to the Human Resources Committee.
