Board and Committee Reports (continued)
B. **Minutes of the Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting, September 11, 2012
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of the minutes of
the Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting of September 11, 2012. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, September 21, 2012
Director O’Donnell stated that at the Finance Committee Meeting, the Committee discussed the
subject of grants received by the System that do not cover the costs of providing those services;
she noted that it was requested that the administration reflect that information in the
transmittals for those grants in the future. She added that, in receiving this information, this
does not mean that the Board is making any decisions as to not funding these programs;
however, it is important information that the Board needs to know.
Chairman Carvalho indicated that following the Finance Committee Meeting, there was a
communication sent from Noreen Lanahan, Director of Finance for the Cook County
Department of Public Health (CCDPH), that provided additional information on funding and
program costs for the grant requests; he recalled that for most of the grants, the grant covers the
cost; with respect to the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) grant, he believed that Ms.
Lanahan identified $500,000 in costs that are not covered. He requested that the reports that
the Board received on the subject last year from the former Chief Operating Officer of CCDPH
be retrieved and forwarded to him for purposes of comparison1, because his recollection was
that the costs not covered by the grant were higher; either something has changed or perhaps
Ms. Lanahan has used a different methodology. He added that his questions on the subject
relate to wanting to be informed, rather than being an issue of wanting to revisit the question
determined last year to continue to provide services as a vendor for the State for these services.
The consensus of the Board was that providing WIC services at System clinics was a good
thing for the County to be doing for a number of reasons, albeit at a loss.
Director Michael requested that in the future, in addition to disclosing the amount of costs
relating to grants, it would be helpful for the administration to give the Board an assessment of
the following: if there are costs that are not covered by the grant, why it is being recommended
to go forward with the grant, and why the System can provide that service better than others
can2. This will be beneficial for the Board to evaluate these grants going forward, so that the
Board is not unaware of any implication in accepting these grants.
One of the other subjects discussed at the Finance Committee Meeting was regarding the
staffing levels for screening and processing patients through the CareLink Program. In
response to the question of current staffing levels, John Cookinham, System Chief Financial
Officer, stated that he can provide further information on the number of full-time equivalent
employees (FTEs) engaged in this activity3. He stated that there is staffing at the three (3) hub
facilities (Provident and Stroger Hospitals and Oak Forest Health Center) all of the time; there
is not full-time staff at every one of the community clinics. Patients can apply for CareLink at
the clinics; he believed that there are staff at a couple of the clinics who are able to process a
Medicaid application and/or process an application for CareLink.

Board and Committee Reports
C. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, September 21, 2012 (continued)
With regard to the question of how many patients are screened for the CareLink Program, Mr.
Cookinham stated that every inpatient admission is screened. Currently, outpatient patients are
screened upon their request; there is not an adequate number of staff to screen all patients on
the outpatient side that are seen on a daily basis. Director O’Donnell noted that this subject
will become more important, particularly as the System moves to a medical home model and
more into primary care. Mr. Cookinham indicated that on a go-forward basis, the System is
going to change the application process under the Waiver and for the CareLink Program, in
order to facilitate the enrollment process; he believes that the System will be able to reach a
much larger population under a reconfigured application process. Dr. Ram Raju, Chief
Executive Officer, noted that request number 2 under the Contracts and Procurement Items
relates to this subject; this is a request to amend the contract with Chamberlin Edmonds and
Associates/Emdeon (CEA) to redesign and expand the delivery of eligibility and enrollment
services to accommodate enrollment under the 1115 Waiver Demonstration Project.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved the approval of the minutes of
the Finance Committee Meeting of September 21, 2012. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho voted PRESENT on request numbers 2, 9 and 10 under the Contracts
and Procurement Items contained within the Minutes.
D. **Minutes of the Human Resources Committee Meeting, September 21, 2012
During the presentation of the minutes, the Board discussed the subject of hiring processes and the staffing
needs of the System. Maureen O’Donnell, System Interim Chief Human Resource Officer and Chief of the
Cook County Bureau of Human Resources, stated that they have been working with the Shakman office on
developing a process for those executive positions so that Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, has a more
expedited and streamlined process for bringing in people who really have the skill sets that are necessary to
transform the System. Chairman Carvalho noted that any such hires will continue to be “on the merits”; that
political considerations will continue to be prohibited.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of the minutes of
the Human Resources Committee Meeting of September 21, 2012. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

IV.

Action Items
A. Proposed Resolution authorizing the Chief Executive Officer to approve and enter into certain
transactions in support of the 1115 Waiver Demonstration Project and Medicaid Managed Care
arrangements (Attachment #1)
Helen Haynes, System Associate General Counsel, provided an overview of the proposed Resolution. It was
noted that this was first presented and discussed at the Finance Committee. A revision had been requested at
that meeting to include language similar to that contained in the System’s Procurement Policy, requiring a log
to be maintained and posted on the System’s website by the Supply Chain Director of communications on
transactions related to this subject from individuals outside of the System.

IV.

Action Items
A. Proposed Resolution (continued)
Additionally, Ms. Haynes noted a key point in the second paragraph of the proposed Resolution. This section
addresses payments that will be made to out-of-network providers in order to facilitate the operation of the
network; she highlighted this information, in order to be clear that, following approval of this proposed
Resolution by the Board, those payments will be authorized to be made as part of the System’s overarching
Waiver Program.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Velasquez, moved the approval of the
proposed Resolution authorizing the Chief Executive Officer to approve and enter into
certain transactions in support of the 1115 Waiver Demonstration Project and Medicaid
Managed Care arrangements. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Proposed Intergovernmental Agreement between the County of Cook, CCHHS and the State of
Illinois, for use of the Oak Forest Health Center’s Kitchen, for preparation of flash-frozen meals for
the State’s Elisabeth Ludeman Center Food Service program to be delivered off-site (Attachment #2)
Anna Ashcraft, Director of the Cook County Real Estate Management Division, provided an overview of
the item presented for the Board’s consideration. The Board reviewed and discussed the request.
Director Michael, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of the proposed
Intergovernmental Agreement. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #3)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Board’s
consideration. She noted that request number 1 is being withdrawn at this time, as the vendor has not met
the requirements regarding Contract Compliance goals. The Board reviewed and discussed the requests.
Chairman Carvalho inquired further regarding request number 1. He noted that this request is for a contract
with an existing vendor; he asked for further information on the question of an existing vendor who may not
be meeting Contract Compliance goals. Ms. Besenhofer responded that this contract has been in place for
a couple of years. As part of the review and recommendation from the County’s Office of Contract
Compliance to move forward with a proposed contractual request, there is usually a compliance plan that
has been put together by the company to follow. When staff from the Office of Contract Compliance went
back to review whether this company had met their committed requirements, the staff found that the
company had not. Contract Compliance staff has reached out to the company; at this point, the company has
not yet complied.
Ms. Haynes and Dr. Raju provided an overview of request number 2. During the review of the item, the
subject of contingency contracts was discussed. Director Muñoz noted that contingency contracts need to
have specific deliverables, timelines and thresholds that are monitored. Director O’Donnell stated that, as
this contract amendment is regarding enrolling people, there are hard and fast benchmarks that are easily
identifiable; the System will be able to track CEA’s activities. Dr. Raju stated that, as part of the Waiver

Action Items
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
updates, the administration will be providing enrollment activity information to the Finance Committee on a
monthly basis; this will be a measurement that the Committee can review. Ms. Haynes added that because
the System will have the On Point System, which will be interfaced with the State’s system and the third
party administrator’s systems, the administration will be able to see exactly what kind of enrollment activity
is occurring, from a management standpoint.
Chairman Carvalho noted that this type of contract is for services that the System intends to build up
internally over time. Dr. Raju concurred; he stated that many of the services related to the Waiver that are
provided by vendors or contractual employees are expected to become integrated into an in-house
department for coordinated /managed care.
Director Michael stated that during the Waiver Demonstration Project, the System is going to have a
number of vendors, suppliers and people helping to both enroll patients and provide services over that
period of time; the intention, in many cases, is to transition those services back into the System. He stated
that it would be helpful if Dr. Raju can keep the Board informed about who is doing what, and then for each
of those organizations, what the transition plan is for each at the end of the Demonstration Project. Dr. Raju
responded that a master document will be compiled with all the different elements of it – responsibilities,
measurements and transition plans.
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of request
numbers 2 and 3, under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
D. Any items listed under Sections III, IV and VII

V.

Report from Chairman of the Board
At this time, the Board recessed the regular session, in order to convene and recess closed session to the call of
the Chair. Following Chairman Carvalho’s recess of closed session, the Board reconvened its regular session and
continued to receive information on Items V and VI.
A. Board Education
 Set Targets Achieve Results (STAR) Report – 2nd Quarter 2012 (Attachment #4)
Dr. Krishna Das, System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety, provided an overview of the STAR
Report. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the review of information, the subject of presenting this type of information to the Board and
Quality and Patient Safety (QPS) Committee was discussed. It was noted that the STAR Report is part of
the Cook County Board President’s initiative; however, the measures that are included in the STAR Report
are selected by System staff.

Board Education
 STAR Report (continued)
Further discussion was held regarding which measures should be highlighted and reported on a more
regular basis to the System Board or its Committees. Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief Medical Officer,
stated that he will work on the report of measures regarding quality and patient safety with the Chair of the
QPS Committee, Director Michael4; it was also noted that core measures are currently included in reports
presented to the QPS Committee. Chairman Carvalho suggested that further thought should be given to the
question of what information presented at the QPS Committee Meetings should be highlighted for
presentation at each Board Meeting5. Dr. Mason responded that he will work with Director Michael on that
matter. Director Michael stated it is his intention to go into 2013 with a set of goals with which the Board
and administration feel comfortable; however, he noted that this involves more than setting goals, this
includes a plan to achieve success and meet the goals. This is something that Dr. Das, Dr. Mason and
others are working on; the roadmap of how the System plans to achieve the goals is as important as setting
the goals themselves.
 National Patient Safety Goals (Attachment #5)
Dr. Das stated that the National Patient Safety Goals were developed by The Joint Commission; these Goals
were established to help address specific areas of concern in regards to patient safety.

VI.

Attachment #6).

Currently CEA is paid a ?at fee plus a contingency fee based upon revenues generated as a 
result of its efforts. Based on this methodology CEA was paid approximately $8.9 million in the past year and has
provided between 88-93 employees to service the needs.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System entered into a five contract with Sodexo, Inc. to provide management
of Food and Nutrition Services, Environmental Services and Patient Transportation Services in July 201 Since
then, the and Sodexo have evaluated their expectations under the contract and are in the process of
negotiating a proposed amendment for presentation to this Board within the next few months.

 
   
 
      
 
   
 

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
Pending negotiation of a more comprehensive amendment, management requests to amend the Sodexo
contract to provide for the management and staffing for environmental cleaning services in the Ambulatory and
Community Health Network for a period of six months. This arrangement will permit to replace the most
recent contractor, DaySpring and to consolidate the management of environmental cleaning services across the
Health System. Sodexo will also provide staffing for these services and will have the ability to leverage this staffing if
it is needed elsewhere within facilities. expects to arrange for continued ACHN environmental
cleaning services as part of a more comprehensive amendment to be presented to the Board in the near future.

 
     
     
      
 

  

issued three requests for proposals for the subject services. The first two RFPs were responded to by only
one proposer. The third RFP received three responses, but the vendors did not possess significant health care
experience. Sodexo is a GPO vendor, currently manages environmental services in all other facilities and
has health care experience. Using Sodexo will allow to secure a vendor familiar with standards of The Joint
Commission and to standardize its environmental services operations.

National Patient Safety Goals

The purpose of the National Patient Safety Goals is to improve patient safety. The goals focus on problems
in health care safety and how to solve them.
Identify patients correctly
NPSG.01.01.01

NPSG.01.03.01

Use at least two ways to identify patients. For example, use the patient’s name and date of
birth. This is done to make sure that each patient gets the correct medicine and treatment.
Make sure that the correct patient gets the correct blood when they get a blood
transfusion.

Improve staff communication
Get important test results to the right staff person on time.
NPSG.02.03.01
Use medicines safely
NPSG.03.04.01

Before a procedure, label medicines that are not labeled. For example, medicines in syringes,
cups and basins. Do this in the area where medicines and supplies are set up.

NPSG.03.05.01

Take extra care with patients who take medicines to thin their blood.

NPSG.03.06.01

Record and pass along correct information about a patient’s medicines. Find out what
medicines the patient is taking. Compare those medicines to new medicines given to the
patient. Make sure the patient knows which medicines to take when they are at home. Tell the
patient it is important to bring their up-to-date list of medicines every time they visit a doctor.

Prevent infection
NPSG.07.01.01

Use the hand cleaning guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the
World Health Organization. Set goals for improving hand cleaning. Use the goals to improve
hand cleaning.

NPSG.07.03.01

Use proven guidelines to prevent infections that are difficult to treat.

NPSG.07.04.01

Use proven guidelines to prevent infection of the blood from central lines.

NPSG.07.05.01

Use proven guidelines to prevent infection after surgery.

NPSG.07.06.01

Use proven guidelines to prevent infections of the urinary tract that are caused by catheters.

Identify patient safety risks
NPSG.15.01.01

Find out which patients are most likely to try to commit suicide.

Prevent mistakes in surgery
UP.01.01.01

Make sure that the correct surgery is done on the correct patient and at the correct place
on the patient’s body.
Mark the correct place on the patient’s body where the surgery is to be done.

UP.01.02.01

Pause before the surgery to make sure that a mistake is not being made.

UP.01.03.01

This is an easy-to-read document. It has been created for the public. The exact language of the goals can

RAM RAJU, MD, MBA, FACHE, FACS 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM 
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
September 28, 2012 
 
FY2013 BUDGET PROCESS 
The  Cook  County  Finance  Committee  will  consider  the  CCHHS  FY2013  Preliminary  Budget  at  their 
meeting scheduled for October 2, 2012 as part of the regular finance agenda.  Approval is expected by 
the  Finance  Committee  and  by  the  full  County  Board  that  same  day.    It  is  anticipated  that  President 
Preckwinkle  will  introduce  the  FY2013  Budget  Recommendation  in  mid  October  with  departmental 
review hearings and public hearings taking place mid October through mid November.  The expectation 
is that that the final approval of the FY2013 Budget by the County Board will be complete prior to the 
Thanksgiving Holiday. 
 
1115 WAIVER 
On Monday, September 10, 2012 the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services and CCHHS 
received the  Special Terms and Conditions (STC) for the 1115 Waiver from the Center for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services.  This is an important milestone in our progress toward finalizing award of the 1115 
Waiver.   We  are  currently  reviewing  the  document  to  determine  what,  if  any,  comments  and/or 
proposed  amendments  we  may  request.    Since  receiving  the  STC  the  telephone  conferences  have 
focused mainly on the issue of budget neutrality.  We are optimistic that we will be able to agree on the 
terms and conditions in a relatively short time period.   
In preparation for the Implementation of the 1115 Waiver the renovation has begun at the 600 S. Hoyne 
Building  for  the  Illinois  Department  of  Healthcare  and  Family  Services  to  process  medical  assistance 
applications  for  CCHHS  patients.    Training  in  the  Patent  Centered  Medical  Home  model  has  been 

Page 48 of 75

 initiated at five pilot ACHN clinics.  Specialty care use and capacity assess, and redirection of patients to 
primary  care  as  appropriate  initiated  with  first  five  of  15  highest  volume  specialty  clinics.    Plan  to 
integrate 254 new clinical staff into current ambulatory sites has been developed and the first phase of 
hiring has been initiated. 
 
PUBLIC HEALTH UPDATE 
Cook  County  Department  of  Public  Health  continues  on  its  path  toward  accreditation  with  document 
selection  to  demonstrate  its  achievement  of  the  standards  and  measures  of  the  Public  Health 
Accreditation Board in process. The goal is to select documents and upload them for internal review by 
October 31, 2012. As part of the process, a mock review with external reviewers from other local health 
departments is tentatively scheduled for February 1, 2013.  
 
The  Communicable  Disease  Control  and  Environmental  Health  Units  have  continued  with  surveillance 
and mitigation activities to respond to the high levels of West Nile Virus activities. As of September 21st 
there were 74 cases including 1 death. The highest number of cases continue to be in individuals aged 
50 and above. The Communications and Policy Development Unit has been active with media interviews 
and public service announcements emphasizing prevention messages.  
 
September is Emergency Preparedness Month. The Community Planning and Preparedness Unit reminds 
families  to  have  to  have  an  emergency  plan  and  has  developed  the  Be  Aware,  Get  Prepared,  Take 
Action!  to  assist  families  in  preparing  for  an  emergency  which  is  available  to  the  public  through  the 
website  at  www.cookcountypublichealth.org.  The  staff  also  participated  in  Employee  Wellness  Events 
with Cook County Health and Hospitals System Employee Health Services to provide this information to 
employees of the Cook County Forest Preserve District.

 RUTH M ROTHSTEIN CORE CENTER 
The Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center has achieved remarkable success in HIV/AIDS prevention, care and 
research over the past 14 years.  As part of the vision of address the new face of HIV in Chicago, major 
renovations  of  the  Center  were  completed  in  2012.    The  CORE  Foundation  will  host  two  events  to 
commemorate these achievements. 
September 27, 2012 – a re‐dedication Celebration will rededicate the Center in honor of Ruth 
M. Rothstein, acknowledge donors/supports past and present and conduct tours of the newly 
renovated areas. 
September 28, 2012 – the Rededication Open House will feature facility tours and a program 
fair.  Staff and invited community agency partners will celebrate the Center’s past, present and 
future. 
TRAUMA UNIT ON NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
The  trauma  unit  at  the  Cook  County  Hospital  [Stroger  Hospital]  is  featured  in  a  National  Geographic 
special called "Chicago Trauma."  The one‐hour show, which aired September 4, 2012, follows a team of 
young doctors working in one of the nation's busiest trauma centers.  The National Geographic program 
documents  the  work  of  trauma  and  burn  surgeons  Andrew  Dennis  and  Fred  Starr,  who  lead  a  team 
treating victims of gunshot wounds, stabbings and car crashes. 
It's the real‐life Grey's Anatomy in Chicago. Every day, a team of idealistic young doctors rides the El to 
Chicago's  gritty  southwest  side.  But  no  amount  of  reading  can  prepare  them  for  the  most challenging 
test of their lives ‐ a residency in one of the nation's busiest trauma centers. At Cook County Hospital, 
realities  of  urban  life  come  crashing  through  the  door  by  the  hour.  With  more  than  5,000  trauma 
patients a year, the action is literally a life‐and‐death adrenaline rush.  
Thanks to Marisa Kollias, Interim Director of Public Affairs and Dr. Faran Bokhari, Chairman of Trauma 
for making this feature possible.

Organizations  and  Non‐Medical  Personnel  to  Teach  Residents  Medical  Spanish  and  Latino  Cultural 
Competency: A Four‐week Resident Curriculum" 
Housekeeping is Everyone’s Responsibility 
During  Environmental  Services  Week,  September  9th‐15th  the  Department  of  Environmental  Services 
conducted  a  program  to  raise  awareness  of  our  role  in  support  of  Housekeeping  Staff  titled 
“Housekeeping  is  Everyone’s  Responsibility”.    Joe  Petrella,  System  Director  of  Environmental  Services 
stated it helps us bring the awareness to all hospital staff focusing on sharing the responsibility to help 
keep  work  areas  neat,  clean  and  safe.    Housekeeping  Staff  submitted  vouchers  when  they  witnessed 
someone  supporting  the  Housekeeping/Environmental  Services  Department.    A  drawing  was  held  and 
the “Friends of Housekeeping” winners and nominating Housekeepers are:

Infusion Room – Stroger Hospital 
As  a  result  of  a  nursing  retirement  in  the  Oncology  Clinic  last  year;  we  needed  to  review  how  we 
delivered patient centered care with our remaining resources.  We identified training opportunities for 
our  clinical  nursing  staff  and  thereby,  reduce  the  cost  of  unnecessary  Emergency  Room  visits  and 
hospital admissions.

 As a result we are able to accommodate performing blood transfusions and medication administration 
in the Oncology Clinic.  We believe this patient centered approach will support our patient experience 
efforts and demonstrates our commitment to our nursing staff.

Carla Johnson, Caseworker, Managed Care/Carelink 
“Mrs. Johnson made a difficult and confusing situation easier and manageable for not only me 
but a room full of others….  Due to Mrs. Johnson’s excellent work ethic and efficiency many

Mr. Dowdell has been so very helpful with any medical issues, from Carelink issuing my vouchers 
so  I  may  receive  my  medication  I  can’t  afford,  to  assisting  my  fiancée  with  her  health  care 
problems.    His  level  of  professionalism  is  above  the  norm  and  this  level  of  efficiency  is  truly 
second  to  none.    I  thank  you  for  having  Mr.  Dowdell  to  work  Patient  Relations;  he  is  a  true

Introduction

The Cook County Department of Public Health
Serving 125 municipalities in the suburbs of Chicago, the Cook County Department
of Public Health (CCDPH) routinely watches for patterns of disease, plans for
distribution of vaccines and antibiotics to community clinics, and provides important
information to the media and public. During an emergency such as a disease
outbreak, weather-related disaster or intentional attack, we will continue to do these
things, but at a much faster pace, using available local, state and federal resources.
In an emergency, CCDPH and its partners will work together to ensure a coordinated
response. Partners include: municipal leaders, first responders (fire, police,
paramedics, physicians and hospitals), schools, businesses, community-based
organizations, the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency
Management, the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
