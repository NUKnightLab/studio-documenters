PROJECTS
Albert Kahn: Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Ms. Kanalos presented the Brownfield Plan for the Albert Kahn project to the DBRA Board.
Project Introduction
AK Owner LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails the
redevelopment of the Albert Kahn Building to create at least approximately 190 apartments
(approximately 156 one-bedroom units, 21 two-bedroom units and 13 three-bedroom units) and
rehabilitate or create up to 64,000 to 108,000 square feet of retail and other commercial space on
the main floor and lower level concourse of the building. At least 20% of the building’s residential
apartments will be affordable units offering rents considered affordable to residents with incomes
of not more than 80% of the area median income. The overall building restoration will include
improvements to the exterior and interior, including full redesigns of public areas. One of the
parcels will be used for surface parking for residential tenants and may be available for customers
of retail and other commercial tenants.
The total investment is estimated to be $48 million. The Developer is requesting $2,976,700.00
in TIF reimbursement.
There will be 300 temporary construction jobs and 6 FTE jobs. The 300 temporary construction
jobs are expected to be created over a 2-year period once construction begins. The 6 FTE jobs
may be related to property management.

 Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of two (2) parcels located in Detroit’s New Center
area, east of Second Avenue, on the south sides of Bethune Street.
Basis of Eligibility
The Property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) it was
previously utilized for a commercial purpose and/or public purpose; (b) it is located within the City
of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; (c) it is functionally obsolete as
defined by Act 381 and an historic resource, or, as to certain parcels, are adjacent and contiguous
to the functionally obsolete property and historic resource and the development of the adjacent
or contiguous parcels is estimated to increase the captured taxable value of the remainder of the
eligible property.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible
activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include demolition, asbestos and lead
based paint assessment and abatement, infrastructure improvements, development and
preparation of a brownfield plan and work plan, and brownfield plan implementation. The eligible
activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be
financed solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities
and will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to commence within 18 months of
approval of the Plan and be completed within 3 years.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the
eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a
Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.
