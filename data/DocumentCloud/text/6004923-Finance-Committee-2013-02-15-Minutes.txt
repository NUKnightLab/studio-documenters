Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Dr. Raju provided additional information regarding request number 2; this was a request for approval of
payment for the purchase of insurance covering against potential liability for the cost of services relating to
organ transplants required by persons who enroll in the CountyCare Program. He stated that transplant is a
service that the System does not provide. Under CountyCare, the System is not only a provider, but it is also a
plan. If someone who is in the plan needs an organ transplant, the System has an obligation to provide them as
a part of the plan, because transplant services are included under inpatient services. Some transplants are
extremely expensive - if a couple of members need a transplant, it will be impossible to provide that amount of
money for a transplant under the per member per month (PMPM) formula; therefore, most companies, as well
as public institutions, buy insurance to cover the cost of transplant services.
The Committee discussed request number 4. Dr. Raju stated that ICD-10 has been postponed several times;
currently it is scheduled to take effect in 2014, but there is a lot of movement to postpone it one more year. If
there is another postponement, the System will probably move a little slower in its readiness activities. Mr.
Cookinham stated that, with ICD-10, the level of coding is many times more detailed. The coders and doctors
will have to be retrained, as this is a very detailed kind of project. Director Michael stated that, as the System
is having difficulty with coding anyway, it would be helpful to hear how management will integrate this effort
into the overall effort to improve the coding throughout the System. Mr. Cookinham responded that there is a
plan to do that - part of the program is to re-educate the coders.
Dr. Raju provided additional information regarding request number 5. Health Management Associates (HMA)
has been involved in the Waiver Demonstration activities for a while; they have also been involved in other
areas in the System. Their staff has deep expertise in Medicaid issues, as well as knowledge of the System.
The request to extend the contract for one month is to align the end of the contract with the end date of the
Waiver Demonstration Project; it was noted that the contract increase dollars are not tied to the part of the
request relating to the extension. HMA’s services were utilized more than what was originally planned; some
of the other areas in which they assisted include the development of the medical home model and chronic care
coordination. As management did not have any internal expertise in those areas, and activities really had to
ramp up very quickly, management utilized their services more than what was anticipated at the beginning of
the program.
Chairman O’Donnell suggested that perhaps the Committee can discuss the status of the development of the
primary care medical home model during Ms. Greene’s update on the Waiver Demonstration Project later in
the meeting. Dr. Raju responded that the group of people who manage that project are not present today; he
will be happy to provide an update on that in the future1.
Dr. Raju noted that request numbers 7 through 10 are being funded by the County as capital projects. It was
indicated in some of the transmittals that the request was to replace equipment that is quite old in some cases;
Director Michael suggested that at some point it would be interesting to hear from Dr. Hota about whether or
where there might be other risks that need to be addressed sooner rather than later. Dr. Hota responded that
audits are run for this purpose, and there is an inventory of the current equipment and life span; he added that
he would be happy to provide further information on the subject as a Board or Committee Education Item2.
Director Velasquez, seconded by Director Michael, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 11, with the exception of request number 3, which was withdrawn,
under the Contracts and Procurement Items.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports – January 2013 (Attachment #2)
Dorothy Loving, System Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports for the period through
January 2013. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
With regard to the information on Oak Forest Health Center, Mr. Cookinham stated that when management put
the budget together for this year, the expenses of providing care were aligned in the appropriate budget – what
was left in the Oak Forest budget was essentially the occupancy costs for the campus. What has not been done,
but probably needs to be done going forward, is to determine how much of the occupancy costs belong to the
System’s clinics and other clinical functions there, as there are other activities going on at Oak Forest that are
not necessarily health care-related. This will allow management to present a better picture of the costs to
maintain the Oak Forest campus.
Mr. Cookinham suggested that, on a go-forward basis, the financial statements should be changed somewhat,
in order to be more in conformance with the way the organization is structured right now. Almost all of the
community clinics, some of which used to report up through Oak Forest, are now community clinics or
hospital-based clinics of Stroger Hospital; the only clinic that is not reported up through Stroger Hospital is the
Sengstacke Clinic – that clinic reports up through Provident Hospital, as it is located on their campus.
Mr. Cookinham reviewed information regarding the average number of days for patient bills that remain in the
Accounts Receivable system. That number has been reduced to one hundred ten; the goal is one hundred or
less. Dr. Raju noted that there is a built-in inherent delay of ninety days, as System is required to send three
notices thirty days apart to the patient to try to collect.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that, after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is in effect, everyone will be
eligible for some type of coverage, with the exception of the undocumented population. He stated that
CareLink cannot be available for people who are eligible for an option under the ACA. Dr. Raju concurred.
He stated that a study was done to take a look at the uninsured population in Cook County; the study
determined that after ACA is in effect, there will be 500,000 uninsured individuals in Cook County. Dr. Raju
stated that the System will need to have an uninsured strategy, even after implementation of ACA, because not
everybody who is eligible for coverage under the ACA is going to be insured. He added that there are also
going to be people who choose not to be insured, because the penalty for non-insurance is much smaller than
the premium they have to pay to get the insurance. Beyond the System, Dr. Raju stated that there should also
be a strategy determined from a County-wide perspective. Chairman O’Donnell agreed; she stated that it
should not be the sole obligation of the public hospital system to care for those who do not have an option for
coverage under the ACA. She added that it is important to remember that non-profit hospitals have a public
obligation to care for that population, as well; she noted that perhaps the strategy should be State-wide, rather
than County-wide.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that sometime before October, before enrollment in ACA will start, there
needs to be a discussion at the Finance Committee, and then at the full Board level, to underscore what the
System’s policy will be going forward regarding the following questions: if one has an option under the ACA
and has elected not to take it, or one is eligible to enroll in Medicaid or is eligible for a heavily subsidized
purchase under the ACA, and one chooses not to enroll, is CareLink available to that person? Or is that person
treated like any other person who resides outside of Cook County?
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that staff at the State are going through the same analysis of the programs
currently offered to uninsured persons. There is a concern that if a person is over 138% of poverty and is
therefore eligible for purchase of coverage under the ACA, what they purchase, although heavily subsidized on
the premium side, may still likely have co-pays; it was noted that the current programs at the State do not have
co-pays. If the County does not have co-pays, persons in that category may well choose to decline the ACA
plan in order to get their care for free without co-pays.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports – January 2013 (continued)
Mr. Cookinham provided information regarding the methodology behind some of the numbers contained in the
financial reports. With regard to the expense for salaries and wages, Director Michael noted that the amount
was dramatically lower than it had been in the month of December. Mr. Cookinham stated that it is based on
the number of pay periods in the month; if the last pay period ends on the 25th of the month, yet there are thirtyone days in the month, then the expense might in fact be a little lower than it should be. Mr. Oder noted that
both months contain the same number of days and a holiday; one would not think that there would be a big
variation, yet there is an $18 million difference between the months of December and January. Additionally,
he noted that he would think that employee benefits would be proportionate to salaries and wages for each
month, yet those figures are the same for each month. Mr. Cookinham stated that staff could further review the
issue and try to build in an accrual for salaries and wages.
Board Chairman Carvalho inquired as to the reason why depreciation fluctuates so much from month to month.
Mr. Cookinham responded that he would review the matter and return with a response3.
The Committee discussed the subject of expense and revenue figures relating to CountyCare enrollment
activities. With regard to expenses, Mr. Cookinham stated that some of the payments to the contractors have
not yet begun, because the contracts have not been completed. Chairman O’Donnell inquired as to the status of
the report that will track this information and be provided to the Committee. Mr. Cookinham stated that staff
from Managed Care and Finance have been working on developing this report – as soon as the draft is finalized
and as the information flows in, the Committee will receive the report containing the various sources of
revenue and expenses, both direct and indirect, associated with the CountyCare Program.
Dr. Raju noted that it takes sixty days from the time a Waiver application generated gets approved by the State.
Once it gets approved, it takes two weeks longer before the System receives any revenue – therefore, it
essentially takes seventy-four days before the application is done and revenues begin to be received.
Board Chairman Carvalho asked whether there is a schedule that can be shared with the Committee that details
what the System’s budget assumed relating to enrollment by month. Dr. Raju stated that there is a working
document that essentially provides this information; he noted that progress is on track, and he can share that
document with the Committee4.
Dr. Raju noted that, initially, the budget was created in a way to accommodate the PMPM payment model.
However, a factor that complicates matters is the Medicaid regular fee-for-service that goes back retroactively
for ninety days. With regard to the retroactive payment, if services are provided in the System, then it is good.
However, some of the people during that ninety day period may be getting very expensive care at other
institutions – if the application is approved, the System has to pay the other institution for the provision of
those services to that patient during that ninety day period of time.
Director Michael stated that, in terms of financial reports, what he is accustomed to seeing is a projection of
revenues and expenses by month and quarter for the entire year, provided at the beginning of the new fiscal
year. This allows for the review of whether or not the organization is running in accordance with what was
projected when the year began.
Following discussion, it was determined that members of the Committee would work with management to
address the requests for information and to provide their expertise in order to develop a high-level operating
indicators report for the Committee and Board’s use.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
B. Update on the following projects:
i. Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (Attachment #3)
Susan Greene, System Interim Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid
Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare. She stated that, as of today, over 12,000 applications have been
received. The goal had always been to have at least five hundred applications received per business day; that
target was reached yesterday for the first time.
There are currently thirteen Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in the CountyCare network; recently,
more FQHCs have been approved to join. With regard to enrollment activities, Board Chairman Carvalho
requested that in the next report on this subject, the following information should be included: 1) month-bymonth projections for enrollment through the end of the fiscal year; and 2) month-by-month projections for
revenues, through the end of the fiscal year5.
Dr. Raju provided additional information on the Waiver activities (Attachment #3), which included enrollment
and net revenue targets and projections.
ii. Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) contract management / electronic exchange system
Ms. Besenhofer provided a brief update on the implementation of the GHX system. She stated that the Supply
Chain modules have been live for six weeks now. A phased implementation was needed, due to inadequate
and incomplete data. Some of the areas are working well, while others are still struggling with the
recommended changes that need to be made. She noted that staff continues to work on acceptable procedures
and documentation for payment of invoices with the County. Training continues for Supply Chain staff and for
the end users at the department level. Policies and procedures still need to be established for the new
processes, as well.
Ms. Besenhofer stated that Phase One focused heavily on Stroger Hospital and the onsite clinics. Phase Two
relates to the Operating Room Sterile Processing buildout. It is anticipated that the Phase Two will be deferred
to a go-live date of June 1, 2013, as there are approximately 20,000 items that need to be built into the system;
additional resources may be needed to support that activity.
iii. Meaningful Use
Dr. Hota provided an update on Meaningful Use. He stated that the main focus that staff has been working on
over the past month has been eligible providers. The system has one hundred thirty-six providers that have
been identified as eligible for the Medicaid Meaningful Use Program – approximately $66,000 per eligible
provider that will be received as a subsidy.
Director Michael inquired whether Dr. Hota has received any provider feedback that is cause for concern. Dr.
Hota responded that there are areas of success (E-prescribing, for example). However, providers have
uniformly indicated that the depart summary is too slow; he noted that some of the capital upgrade requests
should help with that issue.

Re: Purchase of Certain Insurance for CountyCare Program

This memo provides background information and requests your approval of the payment of up to
$2,496,000 for the purchase of insurance covering against potential liability for the cost of services
relating to organ transplants required by persons who enroll in the CountyCare Program. The coverage to
be purchased will be provided by The Ace Group, as placed by the County?s Broker, Mesirow Financial,
and will be priced on a PMPM basis. 

As you know, the must provide or arrange a range of inpatient and outpatient services for
CountyCare members. Because services related to transplantation surgery are extremely expensive, it is
recommended that the purchase a policy of insurance that will provide ?rst dollar coverage for
these services, should they be required. This will insure against the potential of loss resulting from
signi?cant expenses that may exceed the reimbursement received by the County for the operation of the

CountyCare Program. APP i 7 VE

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This is a request to purchase blade servers and storage in order to address performance Issues which have been
expressed to Capital Planning as well as the Bureau of Technology In response to federal mandates for meaningful
use of electronic health records and also to support the 1115 Waiver process the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System upgraded all of its Cerner applications in both ambulatory and inpatient venues (a project named PowerChart
2012). provides access to most critical applications via Citrix. The use of Citrix ensures security and
availability for users across the system. During the planning stages of PowerChart 2012, a sizing process was
conducted to determine optimal Citrix Server capacity post go-Iive. Despite this planning, post?go?Iive has
experienced performance issues in the Citrix environment. With new functionality and an increase in users on the
system performing their required tasks of full electronic records documentation, the clinicians are experiencing a
severe impact to performance, so much so that they cannot use the system at times. It is expected that the increase
in system use will continue based on CountyCare and Meaningful Use requirements. To ensure that the system can
continue to support both the current user load and deliver to our users a stable and responsive system, the purchase
of additional Citrix sewer capacity is required.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended January 31, 2013. This discussion focuses
on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month.
It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
5
Page 26 of 67

 eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the two months with overall
revenue of $108,865 and overall expenses was $137,357.
Net Patient revenue for the two months was $64,988.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $643. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
January-2013 reduced by 13 to 109 days. Additionally, there was a 7 day decrease in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts fell by $16.075M (5.5%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure fell by $8.431M (2.9%) and has
declined in eleven (11) out of the last twelve (12) months. The overall decline in this
6
Page 27 of 67

 figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the collection process,
which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of January-2013 increased by
$0.797M (9.0%) and by $1.139M (13.4%), as compared the November 30, 2012 and the
previous month’s balances respectively. This indicates that fewer inpatient accounts are
moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual cash
collections.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of January-2013 decreased by $1.374M (0.9%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure grew by $1.843M (1.2%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates less accounts had the collection process completed
than in the previous month and that fewer accounts are being removed from active
accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad debt
write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $2.099M (12.1%) by the end of
January-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2012.
This balance, as of the end of this month, was $1.079M (5.9%) greater than the previous
month’s balance. This indicates that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed”
status, as compared to the previous month.

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of January-2013 fell by $14.701M
(10.6%) over the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is $10.274M (7.7%) less
than last month’s figure.
The reduction in this figure, as compared to the prior month’s balance, indicates a greater
number of Out-Patient accounts had their collection and write-off related activities
completed.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Supplies - $9.794M.
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $27.498M
Depreciation - $5.007M
Utilities - $0.261M
Insurance - $2.013M. The reduction of this expense for the month is due to the correction
of prior month’s estimate.

Page 29 of 67

 Nonoperating Revenue was $43.234M. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $11.497M and property tax in the amount of $13.990M. Sales tax
revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the underlying sales
transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois - Sales Tax
represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet received from the
state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales transaction to the
receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 12/19/12 - 01/16/13 .
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" total is a payment to the state for supplemental workers
hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Meaningful Use budget is spread over 12 months, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received. Meaningful Use includes
both the Medicare and Medicaid portions.

Why should Information be reported?
Admissions – Admissions are a measure of IP volume. The more admissions the greater number
of patients being served.
Average Daily Census - Average daily census provides an estimate of utilization of the facilities.
ADC may also point out unused inpatient capacity in the System.
System
Outpatient Visits – The total number of outpatient visits for a week allows a comparison to a
prior week to document an increase or decrease in volume.
IP Gross Revenue – If the IP indicators are increasing the level of gross revenue should move in
the same direction. If there is a difference the difference should be explained. Patients must
b charged
be
h
d ffor th
the services
i
th
they receive
i so the
th S
System
t can ddocumentt th
the costt off their
th i care.
OP Gross Revenue – This is a measure much like the IP level of gross patient service revenue. If
the volume of visits is increasing the gross out patient revenue should grow too. Any problems
should be investigated to make sure all services are charged.

p
Cash Collections – The collection of cash is the final measure of revenue cycle success. A week to
week comparison allows one to determine if things are moving in a positive direction.
Days in Revenue Outstanding – This measures the length of the collection cycle. If the Days in
A/R are increasing the reasons for the increase should be identified and action taken to correct.
Unbilled Patient Accounts – Cash can not be collected unless it is billed. There are many reasons
that accounts remain unbilled. This is a useful measure to insure the revenue cycle process is
working effectively.
Paid FTE’s – A comparison from pay period to pay period should be monitored. If the number of
FTE’s is declining that may indicate a problem as well as an increase in the hours paid to
employees may signal that overtime, sick time, or other non productive paid wages are being used
i
inappropriately.
i t l
Newly Hired Employees – CCHHS must recruit employees for replacements for employees that
leave the system or retire
retire. In addition as new programs are put in service new staff may need to
be hired to allow the program to function properly.

 Dashboard Options
County Care Applications – The number of applications taken for County Care can be supplied on
a weekly basis. Other County Care data can also be supplied if it is requested. Taking actions to
insure applications are taken for County Care is vital to the success of CCHHS’s in 2013.
CareLink Applications – As the System becomes an MCO it is important that all patients are
screened and placed in an appropriate category. The CareLink application process allows
CCHHS to determine if a patient
patient’ss services can be billed to a third party or if a patient can not
qualify for any third party coverage they can receive an appropriate discount.
Medicaid Applications
pp
– Not all ppatients will qualify
q
y for Countyy Care. There will still be ppatients
that will qualify only for traditional Medicaid. The level of these applications must be
monitored to be sure there is an on going effort to obtain coverage for all of CCHHS’s patients.
