 BACKGROUND

The Ohio Traffic Safety Office (OTSO) and ODOT work
together to develop a rolling calendar of safety campaign
messaging to raise public awareness on specific SHSP
emphasis areas and initiatives promoted by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and offer
workshops, training and other events to improve
transportation safety.
NOACA supports the outreach efforts of these agencies
by reinforcing messages through its Division of External
Engagement & Public Affairs, and sharing events that affect
safety and planning efforts in our region.
