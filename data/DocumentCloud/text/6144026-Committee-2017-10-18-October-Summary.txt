Anthony Martin is a Captain on Truck 45 and a 29-year member of the Chicago Fire Department. He is a
former Trustee of the Retirement Board of the Firemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, having
served on the Board for 13 years. He is also a board-certified lawyer and graduate of John Marshall Law
School, as well as a former Local 2 steward.
Daniel Fortuna is a retired member of the Fund, having served for 30 years on the Chicago Fire
Department. This will be his third term as a retired Trustee on the Board. He formally served on the
Executive Board at Local 2 as the Director of Public Relations and is the current President of the National
Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, the largest trade association for public sector
pension funds.
I think I speak for the entire Board in wishing Tony and Dan a productive term in the difficult task of
being a fiduciary to all the members of the Fund.

Fraternally,

Timothy McPhillips
Fund Secretary
