Meeting Minutes - Final

June 20, 2018

1) FY17 $100 million combined between revenue and expenses, performance
better than budget;
2) FY18 $40 million combined revenue and expenses, estimated, better than
performance through May;
3) I & E construction funds are not being spent at predicted rates, we have $600
million in cash;
4) $200 million CIP, which is on pace to spend only $80 million, which may mean
we don't need to fund as much in reserves; and savings that are included in the
budget;
5) $60 million estimated in bond and financing that may be $3 to $4 million
annual savings for next year and going forward;
6) $9 million savings in the DRI Project that came under-budget when the
contract was awarded, which will help the long-term financial plan when it
comes to how much money to set aside; and
7) Close to 100 vacant positions, when filled, will help offset some of the
contractual spending.
