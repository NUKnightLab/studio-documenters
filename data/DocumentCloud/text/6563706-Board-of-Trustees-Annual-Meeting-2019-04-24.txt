 Interim Executive Director’s Report
Annual Meeting of the Board of Trustees
April 24, 2019
Welcome to our 2019 annual meeting of the CAC Board of Trustees.
I’d like to thank Verb Ballets and Shaker Heights Development Corporation, both CAC grant recipients,
for hosting us at The Dealership, a co-working space, in Shaker Heights.
There are several actions before you for approval at today’s meeting. All are included in the 2019
budget and outlined in our 2019 team objectives.


Project Support and General Operating Support guidelines: You’ll be asked to approve the
guidelines for PS20 and GOS 20-21. Neither program includes major policy changes. See the
memos for further details. Thanks to Heather, Luis, Dan and India for their excellent team work to
ensure we’re ready to launch our two primary grant programs again this spring. And thank you to
our cultural partners who helped inform the guidelines by responding to surveys, hosting site visits
and providing feedback.



Support for Artists’ Learning Lab – Year 2: We will also recommend a renewal grant to the Center
for Performance and Civic Practice for Year 2 of its Learning Lab program. See the Staff Report
and the contracts page for more. Kudos to Jake and Heather for managing this successful initiative.



Grantee capacity building opportunities: In response to grantee feedback, we recommend two
contracts to for grantee training and capacity building work. Both will provide support to
organizations who are interested in making their work more racially equitable. This builds off of
our 2016 community and organizational planning. See the contracts page for further details.



In addition, we’ll provide a finance report as well as administrative matters for your review and
approval. See the agenda for a complete list of actions before you.

Finally, let’s make sure to take a moment to celebrate the amazing work of our grant recipients – which
is highlighted in our 2018 annual report. The report will be available at our meeting and will go out
electronically and in hard copy to thousands of our stakeholders in coming days. See the Staff Report for a
preview of this powerful report. Thanks to Jake and Malissa for leading this work.
I thank you in advance for spending time in the materials and preparing for a positive meeting.

 CAC Board of Trustees Meeting – April 24, 2019
Updates from Staff
Each year, Cuyahoga Arts & Culture staff members identify team objectives to guide our work that are
mindful of the staff team agreements that we have made with one another, and grounded in CAC’s Mission,
Vision & Values. Our team objectives fall into three areas: 1) grantmaking; 2) communication and raising
awareness; and 3) effective teamwork and operations.
What follows is brief update on the progress made since last the Board met in February. View a list
of our 2019 team objectives, which guide our work.
1. GRANTMAKING - Connecting with artists and organizations
General Operating Support and Project Support Updates
All final reports for 2018 General Operating Support grants have been received and paid, closing the 2018
GOS grant cycle. Goal Setting Forms have been received from all General Operating Support grant
recipients as well, releasing the first 50% of their 2019 grant. The team is still waiting on one more final
report for the 2018 Project Support grant cycle. Once this report has been submitted the 2018 grant cycle
will come to a close. The team is working closely with the organizations that have outstanding requirements
to ensure that they are submitted promptly.
Program staff have been in regular contact with all grant recipients, conducting several site visits or
attending events related to CAC-funded organizations or projects. Multiple projects receiving Project
Support funding for 2019 are currently underway. Some projects have already been completed and have
submitted their final reports for their 2019 grant. Program staff has also scheduled their first in-person report
out for Project Support II recipients on April 30th at Mount Pleasant NOW Development Corporation.
Staff have also making preparations to launch the upcoming grant programs: GOS 2020-21 and PS 2020.
The applications have been updated and tested in the online system. Workshops and technical assistance
opportunities will soon be finalized and shared with potential applicants, and the public. See the memos
and accompanying GOS, PSI and PSII guidelines in this packet, all of which frame the Board’s vote on
them at the April 24th meeting.
Arts & Culture Network Night
The first Arts & Culture Network Night of 2019 was held on
February 28th at the newly restored Agora Ballroom. This was
CAC’s best-attended Arts & Culture Network Night to date, with
over 100 participants in attendance!
In addition to CAC and Neighborhood Connections staff, nine
artists or arts & cultural professionals helped by assisting with
planning and leading the event. CAC’s aim for these sessions is
to continue bringing the arts community together for relationship
More than 100 people attended the
building, mutual support and to spark new initiatives with others.
February 2019 Arts & Culture Network
We are glad that these gatherings continue to have strong
Night at the Agora Ballroom
attendance a growing sense of ownership from the arts and
cultural community. The next Arts & Culture Network Night
will be held in late May. The exact date and location will be confirmed soon, please plan to join us!

 Support for Artists Grant Updates
 CPCP’s Learning Lab: 12 Civic Practice Projects Underway
Initial Success in Round 1: Following the Board’s approval of $7,500 in funding for each of 12
Civic Practice Projects (resulting from the CPCP’s Learning Lab program in winter 2018), grants
have been issued and the nonprofit-artist collaborative partners are finalizing and implementing
their proposed projects. The projects include a wide variety of efforts aimed at supporting artists
and leveraging their creative assets to further the mission of the nonprofit partner. As a co-created
project, the partners are collaborating to address civic issues and spark meaningful change in a
variety of Cleveland-area communities.
Projects range widely: from reimagining public parks, to helping students conquer fear of failure
and embrace kindness through music, to defining a community identity through branding that
challenges stereotypes, to using storytelling and movement to address challenges among the
homeless population. All are united in their design to engage their communities in shaping
outcomes of the projects. Each artist is receiving a majority of the grant funding for their expertise
and contributions to the co-created effort. We look forward to sharing more about each project as
it comes to fruition between now and the end of the calendar year.
Board Action: Planning for Learning Lab Round 2. At the April meeting we will seek the
Board’s approval to enter into a renewal grant with the Center for Performance and Civic Practice
for a second round of the CPCP’s Learning Lab program. See the contracts page at the end of this
packet for more detail.
The program would begin in Q3 2019 and will once again offer professional development and
funding for twelve artists and twelve nonprofit partners to co-create civic projects in 2020 –
building off the success of Round 1 (described above). Staff continues to evaluate this initiative;
early feedback from participants and community leaders (artists and nonprofits) has been
overwhelmingly positive. Renewing the program will enable CAC to continue offering projectbased support to artists and strengthen the capacity for collaboration between local artists and
nonprofits.


Working with Nonprofit Partners to Serve Artists
Karamu House and Hispanic Business Center joined Cleveland Public Theatre and SPACES by
launching their projects in February and March, respectively. Both are receiving a strong response
and will continue to offer resources and opportunities throughout the year. LAND studio and
Cleveland Arts Prize will announce their opportunities later this year. Staff continues to assess and
evaluate these programs against the planning roadmap to ensure they are meeting goals set forth by
the Support for Artists Planning Team and with an eye to future improvement. To stay up to date
on our arts support offerings, visit: http://www.cacgrants.org/grant-programs/support-for-artists/.

New Opportunity: Supporting Resident-Led Arts & Culture Projects with ioby
Following board approval of a $60,000 grant to ioby, CAC and ioby staff worked to launch the Cuyahoga
Arts & Culture Match Fund on April 3. Artists, resident-leaders and grassroots organizations that have an
idea for a public arts and cultural project are invited use the crowdfunding platform to support their work.
CAC will match the fundraising efforts of these projects, dollar-for-dollar, up to $5,000. The first ioby
campaign eligible to receive Cuyahoga Arts & Culture Match funds launched April 10, and several more
projects are preparing to launch in the coming weeks. Active campaigns and more details about the match
fund can be found online at www.ioby.org/cac.

 Racial Equity Institute: Learning Opportunities for our Partners
CAC is continuing to raise awareness that it will again offer free admission in 2019 to CAC-funded
organizations to participate in learning sessions by the Racial Equity Institute (REI), in partnership with
Cleveland Neighborhood Progress and ThirdSpace Action Lab. Multiple organizations have already
attended the Groundwater and Phase 1 sessions this year, while others have registered to attend future
sessions. Specifically, 35 individuals have attended the half-day Groundwater session and four people have
attended the two-day Phase I session in 2019. If you are interested in learning more or participating in an
REI session, please contact Luis Gomez at lgomez@cacgrants.org.
Neighborhood Connections
CAC is in the second year of a two-year, $150,000 grant to Neighborhood Connections (a program of the
Cleveland Foundation) to co-fund grassroots arts and culture projects in the cities of Cleveland and East
Cleveland. Neighborhood Connections received 172 applications for their next grant cycle. CAC and
Neighborhood Connections expect to announce the next round of co-funded arts & cultural projects in May
2019.
Since 2013, CAC’s annual investment of $75,000 in Neighborhood Connections’ grantmaking has cofunded the work of over 300 grassroots arts & culture organizations. This work is separate from our work
with Neighborhood Connections to co-host Arts & Culture Network Night.
2. COMMUNICATIONS / Connecting with residents
TOGETHER: CAC Releases 2018 Annual Report
Staff is pleased to share that at the time of the Board’s April
meeting, its annual Report to the Community available in
print and online at cacgrants.org/2018.
Focusing on shared experiences and the unifying power of
arts and culture, the report summarizes Cuyahoga Arts &
Culture’s annual activities and highlights a number of CACfunded organizations across our grant programs, including
support for artists.
We look forward to sharing these stories and data with our
stakeholder and grantees; copies will be mailed by the end of
April and extras available at the CAC office. Visit
cacgrants.org/2018 to learn more.
ClevelandArtsEvents.com and Ohio EventFinder
ClevelandArtsEvents.com is now integrated with the Ohio EventFinder, a free online database of arts and
cultural events in the state of Ohio that feeds state and regional calendars. This allows for organizations
who already enter their events on our website to have them automatically transferred to the Ohio
EventFinder without having re-enter event or ticket information. Another plus is that the events are exported
sites such as ArtsinOhio.com,
Ohio Magazine, and PRIZM
Magazine.

 ClevelandArtsEvents.com Artists Network
Staff is working diligently to find new ways to connect
artists and provide a platform on which they can share their
public events. ClevelandArtsEvents.com/artist is seeing
additional signups each week, and is providing visibility to
a diverse range of regional artists. With 125 artists featured,
we continue to find ways to grow the roster of artists. A
recent effort to connect to CAC-funded nonprofits that
work with groups of artists has enabled us to extend our
reach (see right: a recent Facebook post by CAC grantee
BAYarts promoting the ClevelandArtsEvents.com
offerings to their audience).
If you know an artist who is interested in getting connected,
encourage them to visit
www.clevelandartsevetns.com/artists.

In the News
In addition to consistent crediting for Cuyahoga Arts & Culture in the media by our partners, below is a
sampling of recent media clips focused on CAC’s work:


Get out and enjoy the remaining days of February with CAC-fueled events “With
February drawing to a close and Cleveland weather set to warm up for a few days, there’s
no excuse not to get out and enjoy the many outdoor Cuyahoga Arts and Culture (CAC)
activities…” (February 21, 2019) – Fresh Water Cleveland



Cigarette Tax: A Learnable Moment
“Educators talk about “teachable moments”– those times when learning comes easily
because something happens that makes information relevant. This is one of those times for
people concerned about public funding for the arts in Cuyahoga County. (January 17, 2019)
– CAN Journal Blog

See a full list of media placements since CAC’s last Board meeting.
3. BUILDING INTERNAL CAPACITY / Effective Teamwork and Operations
Team Updates
Professional Development
 Nature & Science = Arts & Culture. Several community organizations and funders in the nature
and science space gathered on February 8 for a conversation at The City Club with New York
City’s Parks and Recreation Commissioner Mitchell J. Silver. Commissioner Silver shared how he

 and his staff worked with local residents to ensure neighborhood parks were representing and
addressing the needs of NYC’s many neighborhoods through programming, design and access.


Supporting Artists. Staff members attended various portions of The Joyce Foundation 2019
Creative Place keeping/Placemaking Summit. Many artists and Support for Artists grant partners
also participated. The summit took place March 21-22 at St. John’s Episcopal Church. Attendees
learned about working with developers and municipal government around placemaking and placekeeping. Panels also addresses institutional and individual opportunities for artists.

Racial Equity Work Ongoing
 Joining the YWCA’s Equity Challenge. CAC team members participated in YWCA’s 21-day
equity challenge along with thousands of community members. Each participant received an email
from YWCA addressing topics around equity including the wealth gap, health disparities, and white
fragility to name a few.


Board Action: Grantee Capacity Building. After co-sponsoring with Gund and Cleveland
foundations, a funders conference with Race Forward/GIA last year, CAC staff have been working
with Race Forward to provide an arts-focused equity learning opportunity for our grant recipients.
This is in response to ongoing requests from our grant recipients to build off their learnings in the
Racial Equity Institute and take their work to the next step.
Under the proposed contract, Race Forward would facilitate a 1-day training and a 1-day convening
of CAC grant recipients in 2019. In between these sessions, attendees will participate in a webinar
featuring case studies of communities and organizations applying an equity lens to their work. In
coordination with the Race Forward process, attendees will have the opportunity to continue
connecting with each other for facilitated conversation and advice from local consultant Erica
Merritt of Equius Group. Requests to approve staff’s ability to enter into contracts for both of these
projects are before the Board today for its approval; each comes from an already budgeted lineitem. See the contracts page at the end of this packet for additional detail.

2020 Project Support Guidelines

Executive Summary: At its April meeting, staff will present to the Board the 2020 Project Support
guidelines for review and approval. The guidelines are the policy documents that shape CAC’s
grantmaking work and are the result of months of planning, feedback and discussion. The one
recommended change is to decrease the maximum grant amount to $25,000 (down from $30,000 in
2019) in order to ensure we can support a growing pool of applicants within a fixed annual budget
of $1.9M.
For PS20, the team will continue to streamline processes and offer expanded technical assistance.
As always, this work is informed by feedback from our cultural partners. We made early drafts of
the guidelines available on CAC’s website and shared with all of our current cultural partners. We
requested feedback on the application structure, questions and process (via survey, email, phone
calls and in-person meetings) to inform the guidelines before the Board for its approval, as well as
the team’s approach to technical assistance throughout the application cycle.

Background
Project Support is one of Cuyahoga Arts & Culture’s two primary grant programs. The 2019 cycle of Project
Support is currently supporting 221 cultural partners through a total investment of approximately $1.9
million. This summer CAC will accept applications for the next cycle of Project Support (2020). Our other
primary grant program, General Operating Support, will also be accepting new applications this year.
Important note: recall that, in our financial modeling for 2018 and forward, we do not anticipate growing
the total financial investment in project support above $1.9 million annually; any growth in the program
will be achieved through expanding our reach to new/different organizations, not through increased
financial investment.
What Will Remain the Same?
No policy changes are proposed for the 2020 cycle of Project Support. The core program elements remain
unchanged from the previous cycle:
 Funding criteria – the funding criteria will remain the same, with a continued focus on public
benefit.
 Grant cycles – Project Support will continue to be an annual grant program.

 






Eligible organizations – our grant programs will continue to use the same eligibility criteria and be
open to all kinds of organizations offering public arts & cultural programming. First-time applicants
to Project Support must still apply for Project Support II while applicants who have received
funding within the last 4 years can apply for Project Support I.
Accessibility – Project Support II will continue to have a shorter, simplified application ensuring
accessibility for organizations that are smaller, newer, or have limited grant-seeking capacity.
Cultural Data Profile – applicants to Project Support I will still complete a SMU DataArts Cultural
Data Profile.
Panel Review – Project Support grants will be reviewed by a public panel processes as last year
(in-person for PS I, online for PS II).
Commitment to technical assistance – CAC’s grant program team will continue to offer a variety
of support opportunities throughout the application process. More details below.

Recommendations for 2020 Project Support Program
Project Support I request amount –To ensure we can support a growing pool of applicants within a fixed
annual budget of $1.9M, we are recommending a smaller maximum request for Project Support I. We
recommend that the maximum request amount for Project Support I be $25,000 (current maximum grant
amount for PS is $30,000). CAC staff modeled several different scenarios and is confident that this approach
will allow for continued growth while keeping PS20 within its annual budget of $1.9M.
Using Feedback to Shape our Recommendations
As is our practice, this year’s guidelines have been informed by cultural partner feedback, sourced in a
number of ways. The CAC team maintains ongoing communication with cultural partners by phone, email
and in-person discussions at site visits, Board meetings and events such as Arts and Culture Network Night.
We tracked concerns and comments throughout the previous application process. We also surveyed all the
2019 applicants last fall. In the past month, CAC invited all 221 current Project Support grant recipients to
provide feedback on the draft 2020 guidelines.
Continued Commitment to Technical Assistance
Every cycle, CAC staff commits time and resources to technical assistance for applicants as a step toward
achieving more equitable grantmaking. With a full grant program team (Luis, Heather, Dan and India),
CAC will continue to offer a variety of technical assistance. Examples include:


Staff will offer one-on-one, in-person office hours for applicants throughout the eligibility check
and application processes.



Recognizing that differing levels of digital literacy impact an applicant’s ability to apply, staff
will continue to offer hands-on technical assistance.



Continue to offer application workshops that reflect and serve the diverse pool of Project Support
applicants, by incorporating varied times, locations and methods of delivery. We also view these
sessions as opportunities to live our values of connection and equity, intentionally highlighting arts
& cultural venues and programs that reflect the full range of offerings in the county.



Continue to offer brief videos addressing questions frequently asked by applicants (e.g. completing
budget tables, defining your community, support materials).

 Next Steps
If the policies within the Guidelines are approved, CAC staff will finalize the application documents,
currently in draft form in the Board packet. The late April launch date and a late May due date for the
eligibility check allows more time for the CAC team to support new organizations and offer personalized
technical assistance to applicants. Additional key dates are as follows:

 Dear Applicant,
Thank you for your interest in the 2020 Project Support I grant program. Cuyahoga Arts & Culture’s
mission is to inspire and strengthen the community by investing in arts and culture. CAC is excited to work
with you to connect Cuyahoga County residents to arts and culture in our community.
Cuyahoga Arts & Culture (CAC) is one of the largest local public funders for arts and culture in the nation,
helping hundreds of organizations in Cuyahoga County connect millions of people to cultural experiences
each year. Cuyahoga County residents created CAC in 2006 when they approved a tax on cigarettes to
support arts and culture. Since 2007, CAC has invested more than $182 million in more than 400
organizations both large and small, making Cuyahoga County a more vibrant place to live, work and play.
This cycle, our General Operating Support, Project Support I and Project Support II grant programs are
open to applications. If you’re unsure of which program is the best fit for your organization, please take a
look at the 2020 Grant Program Guide. If you’re still unsure, feel free to contact us.
This document contains the guidelines and detailed application instructions for 2020 Project Support I,
which offers grants of up to $25,000 for 501c3 organizations providing arts and cultural programming to
residents of Cuyahoga County. Please keep in mind these two important dates:

Program Overview

 2020 PROJECT SUPPORT I

Pre-Screening of Applications

CAC staff will pre-screen applications before moving them forward to panelists for review. If the
submitted project does not meet CAC’s definition of a project (above) or of arts or cultural
heritage, or if the application appears to be a request for general operating support, CAC staff will
deem the project ineligible for funding. The application will not be reviewed by the panel and your
organization will be ineligible for funding in 2020.
Application Review Process
All eligible applications are evaluated by a panel of arts or cultural professionals from outside the region
in a public panel review process. Panelists are chosen to represent a cross-section of professionals
qualified to provide expert knowledge of specific arts or cultural disciplines, as well as for their
management experience, professional knowledge of the sector and prior panel experience. CAC staff and
trustees take every effort to ensure that the panel is diverse in terms of race, gender, age, and discipline.
All panelists receive an honorarium for their service.
CAC staff members provide eligible grant applications and support materials to panelists approximately
four weeks prior to the panel review meeting to allow panelists sufficient time for their evaluation. During
the panel review meeting, the panel will evaluate all eligible applications based on CAC Funding Criteria:
Public Benefit; Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy; and Organizational Capacity. For more information see the
Funding Criteria section.
CAC staff members chair the panel review, but do not score or provide opinions on applications. Staff will
manage all administrative and logistical actions necessary to conduct a successful panel review: provide
panelists all documentation necessary to evaluate applications effectively; train panelists in matters of
CAC policy and procedures; and provide all available objective information regarding an applicant to the
panel.
Grant Recipient Requirements
Grant Agreement and Compliance

If your application is approved for funding by CAC’s Board at its 2019 November meeting, CAC will
prepare a letter with the grant amount and grant agreement for each grant recipient. CAC staff
will be available to meet with new and returning grant recipients to review the grant agreement
requirements. To be considered an active grant recipient and receive funding, recipients must
sign a grant agreement. All funded activities and grant expenditures must occur during the grant
period, January 1 – December 31, 2020.
Events Calendar and Credit Requirements

Funding from CAC comes from a tax approved by residents of Cuyahoga County. CAC asks that
organizations receiving Project Support partner with CAC throughout the grant cycle by
communicating with their grant manager at CAC, posting events and job opportunities on CAC’s
website, connecting with CAC on social media, and saying thank you to the residents of Cuyahoga
County for their support. Grant recipients are required to post events (and encouraged to post
jobs) to CAC’s online events calendar, ClevelandArtsEvents.com. The Events Calendar and Credit
Requirements document outlines how to partner with CAC. Grant recipients that do not comply
with these expectations may be subject to a reduced final grant amount.

Reporting Requirements

All grant recipients that receive a 2020 Project Support grant must submit a final report online
within 60 days of the completion of the project. In addition to a final report, CAC staff may conduct
site visits during the project period. Reporting guidelines and instructions will be posted online in
advance of deadlines. Reports consist of a narrative, financial documentation and support
materials. Grant recipients that submit a late final report, or do not submit a final report, may
receive a reduced or revoked final grant amount.
Maintaining Good Standing

In order to receive CAC funds, a grant recipient must maintain its good standing with CAC during
the grant period. A grant recipient is in good standing if it:
•

Fully and completely meets all requirements as stated in the grant agreement for the
duration of the grant period;

•

Accurately represents its organization and its activities in all documents submitted to CAC.
This includes, but is not limited to, the eligibility check, application, final report and all
other reports and forms; and

• Continues to meet the eligibility criteria.
A grant recipient not in good standing with CAC will be officially informed of this status in writing.

2020 PROJECT SUPPORT I

Organizations that do not have a primary mission that is arts & culture are encouraged to apply
(community development corporations, social service organizations, etc.) if the proposed project
meets CAC’s definition of arts and culture.

funds can include, but are not limited to, foundation or government grants, private donations,
ticket sales, and member dues.
Matching funds may not include other funds from CAC. This includes CAC co-funded grants
through the Neighborhood Connections program. Contact CAC staff with any questions.
What are the funding restrictions?
Project Support I funds cannot be requested for: operating support; fundraising events; religious
ceremonies or events advancing or inhibiting a particular religious ideology; or advocacy of
specific political causes or candidates.

Application Process

 2020 PROJECT SUPPORT I

Step 1: Eligibility Check

Eligibility Check due May 30, 2019, by 4:30 pm ET



Submit the Eligibility Check

The eligibility check is the first step in applying for a Project Support grant for all applicants and is
submitted via CAC’s online application and reporting system. CAC uses the eligibility check process
to determine whether an organization meets the criteria to submit an application. You do not
need to have a finalized project plan at this stage.
Organizations that do not complete the eligibility check will not be permitted to submit a Project
Support grant application and will not be eligible for funding. However, completing the eligibility
check does not automatically make your organization eligible to apply for funding. Following the
submission of the online eligibility check, CAC will notify applicants via email, to the primary
contact on record, whether or not they are eligible.
Recipients of 2018 or 2019 Project Support grant funds will submit fewer items during the
eligibility check process.
The following table indicates what documentation must be uploaded for the eligibility check.

Documentation required based on past CAC funding



Complete your FY 2018 Cultural Data Profile and Generate and Review the Funder
Report

Cuyahoga Arts & Culture requires all Project Support I applicants to complete a FY 2018 Cultural
Data Profile through the SMU DataArts website (http://www.culturaldata.org/) as part of the
Eligibility Check process. SMU DataArts is a national, collaborative online system that collects and
standardizes historical financial and organizational data.
You will need to generate your CAC Funder Report and upload it in the Support Materials section.
Please refer to the Cultural Data Profile Guide for more information.


Learn your Maximum Request Amount and Gain Access to the Online Application

Cuyahoga Arts & Culture determines your maximum grant request amount. This amount is
based on the financial information submitted in your SMU DataArts funder report during the
eligibility check. The maximum grant request amount reflects up to 15% of the organization’s
expenses for arts or cultural programming (last line in your funder report under Expense Details
called “Total expenses less in-kind”) after deducting CAC funds, not to exceed $25,000.
To estimate your maximum request amount, use this formula:

[

Your FY 2018
Arts and Culture
Expenses

-

Your FY 2018
In-Kind
Expenses

-

Your 2018
CAC Grant

]

X 15%

CAC staff will be happy to help you estimate your maximum grant request. Contact a program
manager for more details.
Your request amount may not exceed the maximum grant request amount determined by CAC or
50% of the proposed project’s total expenses. Grant requests may only include expenses directly
related to the project that will be incurred during the grant period. Please note: The grant amount
you receive may differ from your maximum grant request amount.
Once your organization has been deemed eligible, the primary contact on file will receive an email
providing access to the online Project Support I application. The earlier you submit the eligibility
check, the sooner you will have access to the online application.

Application Process

 2020 PROJECT SUPPORT I

Step 2: Application

Application due August 1, 2019, by 4:30 pm ET


Gather your Support Materials

Support materials are images, audio, video, links and/or other supporting documents that help
bring your organization’s mission and programs to life for panelists. They are essential to your
application and play a critical role in helping panelists evaluate your organization and gain a better
understanding of the proposed project. You may submit up to three support materials with your
application. Please refer to the Support Materials Guide for more information.


Complete and Submit the Application by August 1, 2019, by 4:30 pm ET

To be considered complete, an application must include all required narrative responses, a
complete budget and support materials. See the Application section further details.
Late or incomplete applications will NOT be accepted. After 4:30 pm ET applications will no longer
be able to be submitted through the online system.



Attend the Public Panel Review Meeting

•

The public panel review meeting will take place at the Idea Center at Playhouse Square
during the week of September 23, 2019.

•

CAC staff will notify all applicants of the panel review meeting dates, times and locations;
live streaming links; and will post all details on the CAC website in advance. Additional
information will be made available closer to the panel review date.

•

Though applicants do not take part in the panel deliberations, they are encouraged to

2020 PROJECT SUPPORT I

•

Any applicant receiving an averaged final panel score of 75.00 or higher will be
recommended for a Project Support grant at either full or partial funding. Any applicant
receiving a final panel score lower than 75.00 will not be recommended for a Project
Support grant. Scores are not rounded.

•

CAC staff will notify all applicants of their final panel score and whether they will be
recommended for funding via email within two weeks of the panel review meeting.

Step 4: Application Results


Attend the CAC Board of Trustees Meeting to Learn your Grant Amount

•

Panel scores and grant amounts will not be confirmed until the November CAC Board of
Trustees meeting. This meeting is open to the public, and applicants are encouraged to
attend.

•

The grant amount and total number of Project Support I grants will be determined by the
following factors: the amount of funding allocated to the Project Support grant program
(I & II); the panel score for each application; and the total request amount of all
applications eligible for funding.

Kulture Kids has received Project Support I funding since 2015

These are general guidelines and are subject to change based on the total CAC funds
available to the Project Support grant program in any given year. It is possible that all of
the allocated Project Support grant funds could be awarded to those applicants receiving
higher scores and applicants with lower scores (within the 75-100 point range) will not
receive funding.

Application Process

 2020 PROJECT SUPPORT I



Appeals Process

CAC will only consider and review appeals that are evidence-based and due to materially
significant CAC processing errors that could have compromised an applicant’s grant proposal. This
does not include information that was in excess of the application’s space limitations or
information that was submitted after the application deadline. Any requests for appeals must be
filed with the Executive Director within 10 working days after the conclusion of the panel review
meeting. Requests received after 10 days will not be considered.
Please note: The panel’s analysis and scoring of applications are not subject to appeal and
therefore will not be considered for appeal by the CAC Board of Trustees. Neither grant awards
nor grant award amounts are subject to appeal.

Cassidy Theatre has received Project Support I funding since 2013.

Funding Criteria and Scoring
What are Funding Criteria?
The Funding Criteria are the principles that anchor the Project Support application: Public Benefit; Artistic
and Cultural Vibrancy; and Organizational Capacity.
Why Funding Criteria Matter
Panelists will use the Funding Criteria to evaluate and score the application. Your organization’s
commitment to Public Benefit; Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy; and Organizational Capacity should thread
through your entire application, including the narrative, financials and support materials. By
demonstrating this commitment, organizations of any size and discipline can achieve an exceptional rating
in each of the three priority areas.
Panelists will evaluate and score the application using the following criteria for a total of 100 possible
points:
Public Benefit: 45 points

CAC defines public benefit as an organization’s ability to meaningfully engage its community
through its project.
An organization meaningfully engages its community by:
• Demonstrating that it understands, respects, works with, and responds to its community
• Using knowledge of its community to drive its work
• Building meaningful relationships with residents and community partners
• Being accessible and inviting to its community and open to the public
Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy: 35 points

CAC defines Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy as an organization’s ability to create a quality project
that inspires and challenges its community.
An organization inspires and challenges its community by:
● Engaging a diverse team of arts and cultural professionals, qualified to complete the project
● Inspiring its community to think creatively and/or differently
● Incorporating a process of reflection that ensures fresh programming
Organizational Capacity: 20 points

Cuyahoga Arts & Culture defines Organizational Capacity as an organization’s ability to
successfully plan for and manage its project.
An organization successfully plans for and manages its project by:
● Recruiting and retaining an engaged and diverse board, staff, and/or volunteers who are
qualified to complete the project
● Planning as a team to set project goals, measure progress and evolve
● Having clear plans to implement the project and achieve stated project goals
● Setting a budget that is realistic and appropriate for the project; demonstrating a clear plan
to reach the match requirement

requested from CAC? (Up to 500 characters)

5)

Review your SMU DataArts Funder Report. The data in your Funder Report may support or
challenge your application’s narrative and/or proposed budget. Use this space to provide any
additional explanation to help panelists better understand how your attendance, program or
financial data connects to your application. (up to 1,000 characters)
Tip: Panelists review the Funder Report the same way they do your other support
materials. Use this space to make sure it tells the same story as the rest of your
application. Call out trends, themes or line items that support your application. Clarify
any areas that might be confusing, contradictory or leave panelists with unanswered
questions. Please refer to the Cultural Data Profile Guide for further information.

Support Materials
Support materials bring your project to life and play a critical role in helping panelists evaluate your
application. CAC encourages applicants to carefully select items that are clear, recent and relevant to
the proposed project. Support materials may include images, audio files, videos, hyperlinks and/or other
supporting documents.
Please consider using web-based support materials instead of uploading large files. You can share links
such as a YouTube video or online photo album. Submitted links still count toward your maximum
allowed. Panelists will not review materials in excess of the three optional support materials.
See the Support Materials Guide for more information on selecting, uploading and/or linking to support
materials.
Please note: CAC does not own, collect royalties on or hold copyrights to artistic products resulting from
its grants, nor will it take any action on behalf of the grant recipient to protect the grant recipient’s
intellectual property rights. CAC does, however, have legal authority to reproduce and use submitted
documentation (electronically and in print) of such artistic products for educational, promotional, official
or noncommercial purposes.

Note for colleges and universities: Colleges and universities are eligible only for activities that clearly
serve the needs of the community and are designed to involve a broad audience. Activities that are creditproducing or are oriented primarily to collegiate students and the academic community are not eligible.
What is a Project?
A project is a specific, connected set of activities, with a beginning and an end, explicit goals/objectives
and a predetermined cost that does not equal the organization’s total annual budget. Projects may be
one-time events, such as a festival or exhibit, or a defined series of events, such as a roster of classes or a
series of productions. Projects with multiple components must show that there is a cohesive theme that
ties the project together.
Pre-Screening of Applications

CAC staff will pre-screen applications before moving them forward to panelists for review. If the
submitted project does not meet CAC’s definition of a project (above) or arts or cultural heritage,
or if the application appears to be a request for general operating support, CAC staff will deem
the project ineligible for funding. The application will not be reviewed by the panel and your
organization will be ineligible for funding in 2020.
Application Review Process
All eligible applications are evaluated by a panel of arts or cultural professionals from outside the region
in an online panel review process. There is no in-person panel. Panelists will review and score
applications independently and provide written feedback.

Program Overview

 2020 PROJECT SUPPORT II

Panelists are chosen to represent a cross-section of professionals qualified to provide expert knowledge
of specific arts or cultural disciplines, as well as for their management experience, professional knowledge
of the sector and prior panel experience. CAC staff and trustees take every effort to ensure that the panel
is diverse in terms of race, gender, age, and discipline. All panelists receive an honorarium for their service.
CAC staff members provide eligible grant applications and support materials to panelists approximately
four weeks prior to the panel review meeting to allow panelists sufficient time for their evaluation. During
the panel review meeting, the panel will evaluate all eligible applications based on CAC Funding Criteria:
Public Benefit; Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy; and Organizational Capacity. For more information see the
Funding Criteria section.
CAC staff monitors the online panel review but does not score or provide opinions on applications. Staff
will manage all administrative and logistical actions necessary to conduct a successful panel review:
provide panelists all documentation necessary to evaluate applications effectively; train panelists in
matters of CAC policy and procedures; and provide all available objective information regarding an
applicant to the panel.
Grant Recipient Requirements
Grant Agreement and Compliance

If your application is approved for funding by CAC’s Board at its 2019 November meeting, CAC will
prepare a letter with the grant amount and grant agreement for each grant recipient. CAC staff
will be available to meet with new and returning grant recipients to review the grant agreement
requirements. To be considered an active grant recipient and receive funding, recipients must
sign a grant agreement. All funded activities and grant expenditures must occur during the grant
period, January 1 – December 31, 2020.
Events Calendar and Credit Requirements

Funding from Cuyahoga Arts & Culture comes from a tax approved by residents of Cuyahoga
County. CAC asks that organizations receiving Project Support partner with CAC throughout the
grant cycle by communicating with their grant manager at CAC, posting events and job
opportunities on CAC’s website, connecting with CAC on social media, and saying thank you to
the residents of Cuyahoga County for their support. Grant recipients are required to post events
(and encouraged to post jobs) to CAC’s online events calendar, ClevelandArtsEvents.com.
The Events Calendar and Credit Requirements document outlines how to partner with us
effectively. Grant recipients that do not comply with these expectations may be subject to a 10%
reduction to their final grant amount.
Grant Requirements

All grant recipients that receive a 2020 Project Support grant must submit a final report online
within 60 days of the completion of the project. In addition to a final report, CAC staff may conduct
site visits during the project period. Reporting guidelines and instructions will be posted online in
advance of deadlines. Reports consist of a narrative, financial documentation and support
materials. Grant recipients that submit a late final report, or do not submit a final report, may
receive a reduced or revoked final grant amount.

2020 PROJECT SUPPORT II

Application FAQ’s

What is an eligible project?
Proposed projects must be arts or cultural activities open to the public. The funded activities
must originate and be completed during the grant period, January 1 – December 31, 2020.
The project must be open to the public and conducted in Cuyahoga County. Organizations
may only apply for one project per funding cycle. College and university projects must involve
and show support from the general community beyond the students, faculty and staff.
What does CAC mean by arts and culture?
The Ohio Revised Code Chapter 3381, CAC’s enabling law, defines arts and culture as
“including, but not limited to, literature, theater, music, dance, ballet, painting, sculpture,
photography, motion pictures, architecture, archaeology, history, natural history, or the
natural sciences.”
Organizations that do not have a primary mission that is arts & culture are encouraged to
apply (community development corporations, social service organizations, etc.), as long as
the proposed project meets CAC’s definition of arts and culture.
How much can I request?
The request amount may not exceed $5,000 or 50% of the proposed project’s total
expenses. Grant requests may only include expenses directly related to the project, which
will be incurred during the grant period.
Are there match requirements?
Project Support II grants are matching grants. Applicants are required to leverage CAC funds
to secure additional funds from other sources. This program requires a 1:1 match by the
applicant. This means that CAC will provide no more than one half of the projects total
expenses. For the purposes of PS II, the value of volunteer labor is set at $24.69, the most
recently published value for volunteer time for the United States.
The matching funds may come from any source. Up to 50% of your organization’s matching
funds can come from in-kind contributions. Sources of your matching funds include, but are
not limited to: foundation and/or government grants, private donations, ticket sales and
member dues.
Matching funds may not include other funds from Cuyahoga Arts & Culture. This includes CAC
co-funded grants through the Neighborhood Connections program. Contact CAC staff with
any questions.
What are the funding restrictions?
Project Support II funds cannot be requested for: operating support; fundraising events;
religious ceremonies or events advancing or inhibiting a particular religious ideology; or
advocacy of specific political causes or candidates.

Step 1: Eligibility Check

Eligibility Check due May 30, 2019, by 4:30 pm ET



Submit the Eligibility Check

The eligibility check is the first step in applying for a Project Support grant for all applicants and is
submitted via CAC’s online application and reporting system. CAC uses the eligibility check process
to determine whether an organization meets the criteria to submit an application. CAC staff will
review applicant documents including articles of incorporation, charity check, and Secretary of
State certificate of good standing to determine eligibility. You do not need to have a finalized
project plan at this stage.
Organizations that do not complete the eligibility check will not be permitted to submit a Project
Support grant application and will not be eligible for funding. However, completing the eligibility
check does not automatically make your organization eligible to apply for funding. Following the
submission of the online eligibility check, CAC will notify applicants via email, to the primary
contact on record, whether or not they are eligible.
Recipients of 2018 or 2019 Project Support grant funds will submit fewer items during the
eligibility check process.



Gather your Support Materials

Support materials are images, audio, video, links and/or other supporting documents that help
bring your organization’s mission and programs to life for panelists. They are essential to your

understanding of the proposed project. You may submit up to three support materials with your
application. Please refer to the Support Materials Guide for more information.


Complete and Submit the Application by August 1, 2019, by 4:30 pm ET

Step 4: Application Results




Attend the CAC Board of Trustees Meeting to Learn your Grant Amount

•

Panel scores and grant amounts will not be confirmed until the November CAC Board of
Trustees meeting. This meeting is open to the public, and applicants are encouraged to
attend.

•

The grant amount and total number of Project Support II grants will be determined by the
following factors: the amount of funding allocated to the Project Support grant program
(I & II); the panel score for each application; and the total request amount of all
applications eligible for funding.

•

These are general guidelines and are subject to change based on the total CAC funds
available to the Project Support grant program in any given year. It is possible that all of
the allocated Project Support grant funds could be awarded to those applicants receiving
higher scores and applicants with lower scores will not receive funding.

Appeals Process

CAC will only consider and review appeals that are evidence-based and due to materially
significant CAC processing errors that could have compromised an applicant’s grant proposal. This
does not include information that was in excess of the application’s space limitations or
information that was submitted after the application deadline. Any requests for appeals must be
filed with the Executive Director within 10 working days after the conclusion of the panel review.
Requests received after 10 days will not be considered.
Please note: The panel’s analysis and scoring of applications are not subject to appeal and
therefore will not be considered for appeal by the CAC Board of Trustees. Neither grant awards
nor grant award amounts are subject to appeal.

Funding Criteria and Scoring
What are Funding Criteria?
The Funding Criteria are the principles that anchor the Project Support application: Public Benefit; Artistic
and Cultural Vibrancy; and Organizational Capacity.
Why Funding Criteria Matter
Panelists will use the Funding Criteria to evaluate and score the application. Your organization’s
commitment to Public Benefit; Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy; and Organizational Capacity should thread
through your entire application, including the narrative, financials and support materials. By
demonstrating this commitment, organizations of any size and discipline can achieve an exceptional rating
in each of the three priority areas.
Panelists will evaluate and score the application using the following criteria:
Public Benefit

CAC defines public benefit as an organization’s ability to meaningfully engage its community
through its project.
An organization meaningfully engages its community by:
● Demonstrating that it understands, respects, works with, and responds to its community
● Using knowledge of its community to drive its work
● Building meaningful relationships with residents and community partners
● Being accessible and inviting to its community and open to the public
Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy

CAC defines Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy as an organization’s ability to create a quality project
that inspires and challenges its community.
An organization inspires and challenges its community by:
● Engaging a diverse team of arts and cultural professionals, qualified to complete the project
● Inspiring its community to think creatively and/or differently
● Incorporating a process of reflection that ensures fresh programming
Organizational Capacity

Cuyahoga Arts & Culture defines Organizational Capacity as an organization’s ability to
successfully plan for and manage its project.
An organization successfully plans for and manages its project by:
● Recruiting and retaining an engaged and diverse board, staff, and/or volunteers who are
qualified to complete the project
● Planning as a team to set project goals, measure progress and evolve
● Having clear plans to implement the project and achieve stated project goals
● Setting a budget that is realistic and appropriate for the project; demonstrating a clear plan
to reach the match requirement

2020-21 General Operating Support

Executive Summary: At its April meeting, staff will present to the Board the 2020-21 General
Operating Support guidelines for review and approval. The guidelines are the policy documents that
shape CAC’s grantmaking work and are the result of months of planning, feedback and discussion.
CAC’s staff is not proposing policy changes to the 2020-21 cycle of General Operating Support.
As always, this work is informed by feedback from our cultural partners. We made early drafts of
the guidelines available on CAC’s website and reached out to our current cultural partners. We
requested feedback on the application structure, questions and process (via survey, email, phone
calls and in-person meetings) to inform the guidelines before the Board for its approval, as well as
the team’s approach to technical assistance throughout the application cycle.
Background
General Operating Support is one of Cuyahoga Arts & Culture’s two primary grant programs. The 201819 cycle of General Operating Support is currently supporting 61 grant recipients (steady cohort) through
a total investment of $10.2 million. This summer CAC will accept applications for the next cycle of General
Operating Support (2020-21). Our other primary grant program, Project Support, will also be accepting
new applications this year.
Staying Consistent in 2020-21: Program Goals & Commitment to Grantee Input
CAC’s commitment to General Operating Support remains strong. The GOS program will continue to
provide flexible, substantive, multi-year support to arts and cultural institutions that provide a range of
programs benefiting residents throughout Cuyahoga County.
Informing the recommendations below, program managers have been in regular communication with
current General Operating Support grant recipients throughout 2018 and into 2019. In addition to ongoing
site visits, the team surveyed all GOS organizations in December 2018 asking for their thoughts and
feedback on the upcoming 2020-21 grant cycle. They have also benchmarked CAC’s work against peer
institutions nationwide.
What Will Remain the Same?
Grounded in the same 2018-19 program goals, here is a list of additional core program elements that will
remain unchanged in the 2020-21 cycle:


Funding criteria – the three funding criteria will remain the same, with a continued focus on public
benefit.

 







Eligible organizations – we will continue to use the same eligibility criteria.
Grant cycles – GOS will continue to be a two-year program.
Cultural Data Profile – applicants to GOS will still complete an SMU DataArts Cultural Data
Profile.
Panel Review – we will continue to hold an in-person panel for GOS program new applicants.
Formula – CAC will use the same formula with the base of grantee operating budgets determined
by a three-year average of the organizational revenue as determined by the Eligible Revenue and
Support (ERS) forms. In 2020-21, the maximum annual grant amount for any one organization
shall be no higher than $1,164,989.
Technical assistance – CAC’s grant program team will continue to offer a variety of support
opportunities and one-on-one assistance throughout the application process.

Recommendations for the 2020-21 General Operating Support Program
Continue with steady cohort model. Staff recommends that returning applicants to the General Operating
Support program who have received four or more consecutive years of funding from CAC (including one
cycle of GOS), continue to be exempted from the GOS application and panel review. This model was
piloted during the 2018-19 GOS cycle and feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. In place of
completing the full application, organizations meeting the criteria above will be asked to set goals aligned
with CAC’s funding criteria that will be used in mid-year and year-end reporting. Staff will continue to rely
on existing relationships with longstanding cultural partners, as well as continued mid-year and year-end
reporting, to monitor progress. Grant amounts would be determined by re-running the formula based on
updated organizational financials (Eligible Revenue and Support (ERS) forms for 2016, 17 and 18) in the
fall. See page 9 in the GOS guidelines for more detail.
Issue guidelines and hold panel for new applicants. To ensure a mechanism for new entrants into the GOS
program, we ask the Board to review and approve the GOS 2020-21 guidelines. Approval of the guidelines
would launch the application process in late spring. For new applicants, CAC will continue to hold a panel
in fall wherein a diverse group of arts and culture professionals from outside Northeast Ohio will score
applications. Historically, applicants going through our panel process have experienced a high success rate.
Applicants with a score of 75 are approved for a grant.
Next Steps
If the policies within the Guidelines are approved, CAC staff will finalize the application documents,
currently in draft form in the Board packet. The late April launch date and a late May due date for the
eligibility check allows more time for the CAC team to support new organizations and offer personalized
technical assistance to applicants for the application. Additional key dates are as follows:

in a transparent panel review process. Panelists are chosen to represent a cross-section of professionals
qualified to provide expert knowledge of specific arts or cultural disciplines, as well as for their
management experience, professional knowledge of the sector and prior panel experience. The CAC staff
and trustees make every effort to ensure that the panel is diverse in all respects. All panelists receive an
honorarium for their service.

Program Overview

 2018-2019 GENERAL OPERATING SUPPORT

CAC staff members provide the applications and support materials to panelists approximately four weeks
prior to the panel review meeting in order to allow panelists sufficient time for their evaluation. During
the panel review meeting, the panel will evaluate all eligible applications based on CAC Funding Criteria:
Public Benefit; Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy; and Organizational Capacity.
CAC staff review applications for completeness but do not score or provide opinions. Staff will manage all
administrative and logistical tasks necessary to conduct a successful panel review; provide panelists all
documentation necessary to evaluate applications effectively; inform the panel in matters of CAC policy
and procedures; provide all available objective information regarding an applicant to the panel, and serve
as panel chair.

Grant Recipient Requirements
Grant Agreement and Compliance
In order to be considered an active grant recipient and receive funding, recipients must sign a
grant agreement each year of the two-year grant period. Grant agreements will be issued
following Board approval at the 2019 November meeting. CAC staff will be available to meet with
new and returning grant recipients to review requirements. GOS grants are authorized for both
years of the two-year cycle, with the grant amount paid during each calendar year. All funded
activities and expenditure of grant dollars must occur during the respective calendar year.
Events Calendar and Credit Requirements
Funding from Cuyahoga Arts & Culture comes from a tax approved by residents of Cuyahoga
County. CAC asks that organizations receiving General Operating Support partner with CAC
throughout the grant cycle by communicating with their grant manager at CAC, posting events
and job opportunities on CAC’s website, connecting with CAC on social media, and saying thank
you to the residents of Cuyahoga County for their support. The Events Calendar and Credit
Requirements outline how to partner with us effectively. Grant recipients that do not comply with
these expectations may be subject to a reduced final grant amount.
Reporting Requirements
All 2020-21 GOS grant recipients will have four online reports to submit throughout the cycle:
mid-year and year-end reports in 2020 and 2021. These reports allow CAC to better understand
progress made against goals, offer support where necessary, and provide an opportunity for
organizations to reflect on their activities during the year. Reports consist of a narrative portion,
financial documentation, and other required support material; instructions will be posted online
at least 60 days in advance of deadlines. Grant recipients that submit a late final report, or do not
submit a final report, may receive a reduced or revoked final grant amount.

o
o

o
o

The total amount allocated to be granted for that GOS cycle;
The averaged operating budget for the previous three fiscal years (FY16, FY17, and
FY18) of each organization, as determined by each applicant’s Eligible Revenue and
Support (ERS) forms; and

 Appeals Process
CAC will only consider and review appeals that are evidence-based and due to materially
significant CAC processing errors that could have compromised an applicant’s grant proposal. This

information that was submitted after the application deadline. Any requests for appeals must be
filed with the Executive Director within 10 working days after the conclusion of the panel review.
Requests received after 10 days will not be considered.
Please note: The panel’s analysis and scoring of applications are not subject to appeal and
therefore will not be considered for appeal by the CAC Board of Trustees. Neither grant awards
nor grant award amounts are subject to appeal.

 2018-2019 GENERAL OPERATING SUPPORT

Funding Criteria and Scoring
What are Funding Criteria?
The Funding Criteria are the principles that anchor the General Operating Support application: Public
Benefit; Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy; and Organizational Capacity.

Why Funding Criteria Matter
Panelists will use the Funding Criteria to evaluate and score the application on a scale of 1 to 100. Your
organization’s commitment to each Funding Criteria should thread through your entire application,
including the narratives, financials and support materials. By demonstrating this commitment,
organizations of any size and discipline can achieve an exceptional rating in each of the three priority
areas.
Applications receiving an averaged panel score of 75.00 or higher will be recommended for a GOS grant.
Public Benefit: 45 points
CAC defines public benefit as an organization’s ability to meaningfully engage its community to
achieve its mission.
An organization meaningfully engages its community by:
• Demonstrating that it understands, respects, works with, and responds to its community
• Using knowledge of its community to drive its work
• Building meaningful relationships with residents and community partners
• Being accessible and inviting to its community and open to the public
Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy: 35 points
CAC defines Artistic and Cultural Vibrancy as an organization’s ability to create quality, missiondriven work that inspires and challenges its community.
An organization inspires and challenges its community by:
Engaging a diverse team of arts and cultural professionals, qualified to achieve mission
Inspiring its community to think creatively and/or differently
Incorporating a process of reflection that ensures fresh programming

•
•
•

Organizational Capacity: 20 points
CAC defines Organizational Capacity as an organization’s ability to successfully manage
resources to their best use now and for years to come.
An organization successfully plans for and manages its resources by:
Recruiting and retaining an engaged and diverse board, staff and/or volunteers who are
qualified to carry out the mission
• Planning as a team to set goals, measure progress and evolve
• Planning strategically to achieve a stronger financial position
