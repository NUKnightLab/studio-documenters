 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
October 1, 2015

was held at 121 N. LaSalle St., in Room 201-A
Present:

Ernest Wong, Chair

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 227-229 W. Menomonee
43rd Ward
Old Town Triangle District
Proposed exterior and interior alterations including raising the historic cottage 2’-6”
from grade, construction of new foundation walls, and construction of a new rear
addition with a basement.
Action:

Preliminary disapproval with vote of 3-1 (with Commissioner Houlihan
voting against) with the following findings:

Adverse Effect: The Permit Review Committee (the “Committee”) of the
Commission on Chicago Landmarks (the “Commission”) reviewed the abovereferenced project on Thursday, August 6, 2015. The Committee found that the
proposed project to raise the historic cottage (the “227 Building”) by 2'-6" above
grade (or any amount greater than 1' above existing grade) did not (and would
not) meet the Commission’s Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings and
New Construction (the “Guidelines”), and Standards 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10 of the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings (the
“Rehabilitation Standards”) and would have an adverse effect on the significant
historical and architectural features of the landmark property and district.
Conditions to Avoid Adverse Effect: With the following conditions, the
Committee found that the project would meet the Commission’s Guidelines and
Standards 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 of the Rehabilitation Standards, and therefore
would not have an adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural
features of the landmark property and district:

 a) The project shall be modified to eliminate the front stoop and permit the
227 Building to be raised by a maximum of 1'-0" above existing grade to
accommodate the construction of a new foundation.
b) The area of demolition and protection of the 227 Building during
construction must be better defined. Specifically: (i) the drawings on
Sheet EX-1 shall be revised to clearly show elements proposed to be
removed in dashed lines; (ii) as proposed, the wood studs and roof rafters,
approximately 71% of total, shall be retained with new members sisteredin as necessary; (iii) a licensed structural engineer shall submit a separate
report as part of the permit plans addressing the proposed foundation
replacement and structural modifications, relative to how the 227 Building
and the attached frame cottage to the west should be braced and protected
during construction and to ensure the adjacent property to the east will not
be damaged or require underpinning; (iv) the recommended measures,
sequencing, and protections shall be incorporated in the structural and
architectural drawings; and (v) a licensed structural engineer shall perform
on-site monitoring of the structural work during the demolition and
construction work.
c) As part of the permit application, a survey of the existing floor and roof
heights of the 227 Building shall be submitted. Upon completion of the
foundation construction, another survey shall be submitted indicating the
height of the top of the foundation from grade before proceeding with
lowering the 227 Building on the new foundation. Upon completion of
the project, another survey shall be submitted indicating the final floor and
roof heights of the 227 Building. The surveys shall be stamped by
licensed surveyors and submitted to the Historic Preservation Division.
d) The existing non-historic siding shall be removed and Historic
Preservation Division staff shall be contacted to inspect the condition of
the historic wood clapboard siding and to confirm if any scarring exists
indicating any original features. The historic wood siding for the front
façade shall remain and be repaired, wherever possible. Areas beyond
repair, as confirmed by staff, may be replaced with new wood siding to
match the historic siding in size, type and profile. The west facade,
considering the majority of this side is obscured with the adjacent
structure, may be re-sided with new wood siding with a lap dimension to
match the historic siding. The east facade may be re-sided with smoothfaced fiber cement siding to meet code requirements with a lap dimension
to match the historic siding. Replacement of siding per the stated
conditions shall be done elevation-by-elevation.
e) The new front façade windows, trim, and cornice shall be installed to
match the original features in location, shape, and size based on any
physical evidence uncovered. Enlarged dimensioned details of the cladwood windows, wood trim and cornice, and paneled wood door shall be
submitted with the permit application.
f) The front stair risers shall be closed, the wood shall be painted or stained,
and the railings shall incorporate decorative newel posts at the top and
base of the steps with a pipe rail consistent with historic stair and railing
designs of similar building types. Enlarged details shall be included in the
permit plans.
g) The roofline of the rear addition, proposed to have a flat roof matching the
height of the main ridge height on the north side of the addition as shown

 on plans dated 1/13/15, is approved given its minimal visibility (consistent
with new dormers approved under the Old Town Triangle Dormer
Guidelines adopted by the Commission in 2010).
h) The project as proposed would require a zoning variation and/or
adjustment, and the Commission takes no position regarding any requested
variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code requirements.
2. 701 N. Michigan
42nd Ward
Allerton Hotel
Proposed exterior and interior alterations including new entry vestibules, signage, and
exterior lighting.
Action:

1. Given the size limitations of the entrance foyer, the two exterior, structural
glass vestibules are approved with the following modifications:
a. the ceilings shall be clear or fritted glass to match the existing canopy;
b. ceiling lighting shall be eliminated or minimally visible if necessary;
c. architect shall submit a plan with dimensions of proposed glass
vestibules for Historic Preservation staff review and approval and the
side walls of the vestibules may extend beyond the center line of the

3. Proposed exterior façade lighting is not approved at this time and is subject to
further review by Historic Preservation staff, including a daytime and
nighttime mock-up, to understand visibility of fixtures and impact on historic
features;
4. Details of the supply and return registers under the existing vestibule benches
shall be included with the permit plans; and
5. Details of the proposed light fixtures and radiant heaters for the non-historic
canopy shall be included with the permit plans.
3. 1305 E. 50th
4th Ward
Kenwood District

detached garage.
Action:

and approval; and
2. The applicant shall provide face brick, mortar and limestone samples for

found within the district.

 3. 3139 S. Calumet
4th Ward

Proposed rehabilitation of a single-family residence including a new rear deck, new
garage, and new curb cut.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. The first floor, front-facing window on the north elevation proposed to be
converted to a door with railing shall remain a window with no change to the
opening size. Details of the front elevation windows are to be submitted with
the permit plans. Replacement windows are to be wood or clad-wood, and the
existing brick molds are to be retained and repaired if possible or replaced to
match;
2. Skylights on the flat roof shall be no taller than the front roof parapet and
ridge;
3. The garage door shall have a recessed panel design. Revised elevations and
details shall be included in permit plans;
4. The plans shall be modified to show both side elevations of the garage clad in
brick due to their visibility from the street. The applicant shall provide brick
samples for Historic Preservation staff review and approval prior to ordering
and installation; and
5. If the proposal requires approval from other city agencies (such as Zoning,
Forestry or CDOT), the Commission takes no position regarding such
approvals.

6. 1107 W. Fulton Market
Fulton-Randolph Market District
Proposed new façade for a non-contributing 4-story masonry building.
Action:

27th Ward
