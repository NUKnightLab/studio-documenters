OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

1. Final Recommendation

On March 1, 2019, the Of?ce of Inspector General (OIG) held an administrative hearing
for Computech Corporation (Computech). The purpose of the hearing was to provide
Computech an opportunity to present evidence, testimony, and any supporting information in
response to the preliminary ?nding that Computech and Ram Kancharla have not acted as
responsible contractors and should each be debarred for twenty (20) years. After reviewing all
evidence and conducting an administrative hearing, the ?nal recommendation is as
follows:

- The initial recommendation that Computech be debarred for mean (20! Years be
AMENDED.

I The OIG recommends that Computech be debarred for ten {10) wars with an effective
date of September 30. 2016.

The initial recommendation that Ram Kancharla be debarred for twentv 1201 years be
SUSTAINED

II. Complaint

On September 28, 2016, the Of?ce of Inspector General (OIG) received a complaint from
the City of Detroit Law Department. The letter stated that on April 8, 2016, former Deputy
Director of the City of Detroit?s Department of Information Technology Services 
Charles L. Dodd, Jr., entered into a plea agreement with the Public Integrity Section of the
United States Department of Justice for the crime of Federal Program Bribery. He subsequently
pled guilty on September 27, 2016. Mr. Dodd admitted to soliciting and accepting cash
payments totaling more than $6,000 from Ram Kancharla, CEO of Computech Corporation
(Computech), a contractor that provided information technology services and personnel to the
City of Detroit. It was requested that the OIG investigate both the conduct of Mr. Dodd as well
as Computech.

The OIG investigation was placed on hold due to the ongoing criminal investigation. On
September 14, 2018, the OIG reopened its ?le after Charles Dodd was sentenced to twenty (20)
months in US District Court. Therefore, on September 17, 2018, the OIG sent Mr. Kancharla
and Computech a letter informing them that the OIG was proposing they be debarred for the
maximum allowed period of twenty (20) years pursuant to the City?s Debarment Ordinance.

Shortly after Mr. Dodd?s plea agreement, on September 30, 2016, Of?ce of Contracting
and Procurement (OCP) Chief Procurement Of?cer, Boysie Jackson, noti?ed Mr. Kancharla and
Computech General Manager Ramesh Tavva that Contract No. 2896736 would not be extended.
However, pursuant to Section of Exhibit A of the contract, ?Retention of Contractor?s

IV. Indictment and Guilty Pleas
a. Charles L. Dodd, Jr.

On September 27, 2016, Mr. Dodd pleaded guilty in the US. District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan to one count of federal program bribery.7 On September 11, 2018,
he was sentenced to twenty (20) months in prison, to be followed by two (2) years of supervised
release, for accepting more than $29,500 in bribe payments from two IT companies providing
services and personnel to the City of Detroit.

According to admissions made in connection with his plea, Mr. Dodd held numerous
supervisory positions with the City of Detroit, including his appointment as Director of in
2014. Mr. Dodd exercised supervisory authority over a staff of dozens of public servants and
contractors. He also held signi?cant in?uence over the administration of multi-million dollar
contracts between the City of Detroit and private IT companies.8

According to Mr. Dodd?s Plea Agreement9 and the Government Sentencing
Memorandum,10 he solicited and accepted cash totaling more than $8,000 from Computech CEO
Ram Kancharla and Computech employee Karthik Aramugum. In exchange for cash payments,
Mr. Dodd advised other city of?cials to select particular personnel from Computech to ?ll open
IT positions. He also recommended that city departments select Computech to implement
lucrative technological projects.

b. Ram Kancharla

On June 28, 2017, Computech CEO Ram Kancharla pleaded guilty to tampering with
documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. ?1512(c). On September 10, 2010, a federal grand jury in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan issued a subpoena to
Computech for the production of certain records and documents, including ?nancial records and

expense reports, for Computech and for its speci?c employees. Mr. Kancharla admitted he
knowingly authorized Computech employee Karthik Aramugum to alter certain documents
responsive to the subpoena. Speci?cally, Mr. Kancharla authorized the alteration of certain
expense reports and calendar entries with corrupt intent. On October 7, 2010, Computech,
through its counsel, produced the altered documents in response to the grand jury subpoena. The
altered documents were related to the bribery of Mr. Dodd.

V. Atlanta

The bribery of Mr. Dodd was not an isolated incident by Computech CEO Ram
Kancharla and Computech employee Karthik Aramugum. Prior to the criminal activity
occurring in Detroit, both individuals engaged in bribery of an Atlanta public servant. Though
the bribery in Atlanta is not related to the bribery in Detroit, the Atlanta incident plays a
signi?cant role in the detem?nation pertaining to debarment. The facts of the bribery in
Atlanta is detailed below.

In January 2007, the Atlanta Public Schools (APS) issued a Request for Proposal (RFP)
for a data warehousing project.ll Mr. Kancharla and Mr. Aramugum paid kickbacks to Jerome
Oberlton, APS Chief Information Of?cer (CIO), with the assistance of Mahendra Patel, who
acted as an intermediary. The conspiracy was launched in April 2006 when Mr. Oberlton and
Mr. Patel traveled to Detroit to meet with Mr. Kancharla and Mr. Aramugum.12 These
individuals devised a scheme whereby Computech would bid on the APS data warehousing
project using in?ated hourly costs for contractors working on the project. 13 Mr. Oberlton, in his
role as CIO, ensured that Computech was awarded the project. Once the project was awarded to
Computech and it started to receive funds from APS, Mr. Oberlton and Mr. Patel were paid a
percentage of the data warehousing project in a side deal.I4 Mr. Oberlton and Mr. Patel pleaded
guilty to their roles in scheme.

VI. Administrative Hearing

On October 10, 2016, the OIG sent a letter to Computech?s attomeys to inform
them that on September 28, 2016, the OIG initiated an investigation into the
circumstances surrounding the September 27, 2016 guilty plea of Mr. Dodd. The letter
speci?ed the basis of the OIG investigation was Mr. Dodd?s admission to accepting more
than $29,500 in unlawful payments from two (2) information technology companies
providing services and personnel to the City of Detroit, one of those companies being
Computech.

The OIG investigation was subsequently placed on hold due to the ongoing
federal investigation. On September 14, 2018, the OIG reopened the case after Mr. Dodd
was sentenced. Based on the evidence gathered by the OIG, we found that Computech is
not a responsible contractor. Therefore, we advised Computech and Mr. Kancharla?s
attorneys that the OIG is recommending discipline up to and including debarment.

On November 9, 2018, the OIG offered Mr. Kancharla and Computech the
opportunity to have an administrative hearing to present evidence and testimony in
response to the OIG ?ndings. Section 75-311 of the Charter provides that report or
recommendation that criticizes an of?cial act shall be announced until every agency or
person affected is allowed a reasonable opportunity to be heard at a hearing with the aid
of counsel.?

On November 20, 2018, Mr. Kancharla?s attorney sent a letter to the OIG
declining the offer to participate in an administrative hearing. However, in considering
the period of debarrnent for Mr. Kancharla, the attorney requested that the OIG consider
the following factors in our recommendation of debarment.

The actions that led to Mr. Kancharla?s criminal conviction occurred over eight
(8) years ago, with no subsequent violation of the law.

- Mr. Kancharla voluntarily surrendered all positions of authority at Computech,
after his cooperation with the government was completed.

0 Mr. Kancharla and his family have done many positive things in and for the City
of Detroit and its residents.

The OIG considered the factors put forth by Mr. Kancharla?s attorney. Upon review and
consider his egregious actions, the OIG ?nds that a twenty (20) year period of debarment
is appropriate.

b. Computech

On November 20, 2018, Computech?s attorneys requested an administrative
hearing. The hearing was held on March 1, 2019. Computech was asked to provide the
OIG: (1) details of the bribery that occurred in Atlanta including but not limited to Ram
Kancharla?s and any other employees? involvement as well as the steps Computech took
to prevent such conduct in the future; (2) details on any Computech employees
terminated due to bribery; (3) information on Ram Kancharla?s role as an independent
contractor including but not limited to his duties and contract details; (4) information on
any other City of Detroit employee or elected of?cial who either participated in or
requested bribes from Computech; and (5) details of Mr. Kancharla?s cooperation with
the federal government including but not limited to what precipitated Computech to
?fully and extensively? cooperate in the federal investigation.

Computech CEO Gregory Cheesewright testi?ed on behalf of Computech. On
March 6, 2019, OIG sent a request to Computech?s attorneys for additional
documentation which was discussed at the administrative hearing. Thereafter, in
accordance with our request, Computech provided the additional requested information
on March 19 and March 28. It is important to note that, at all times during the
investigation, Computech was fully cooperative with the OIG.

VII. Debarment Analysis

Debarment is reserved for city contractors who have been found to have engaged in
improper, unethical, or illegal conduct related to their contractual agreement with the City of
Detroit. The purpose of the Debarment Ordinance is to ensure that the City of Detroit solicits
offers from, awards contracts to, consents to subcontracts with, or otherwise does business with
responsible contractors only. Debarment is to be imposed only when it is in the public interest.15
There is no statute of limitations on investigations, ?ndings of violation of the debannent policy
or the initiation of debarrnent proceedings.16

The initial ?ndings regarding Computech not being a responsible contractor was
based on Ram Kancharla?s and Computech?s conduct, through Ram Kancharla, in both Atlanta
and Detroit. At the administrative hearing, Computech attorney George Donnini stated that ?the
bribery that you talk about is all pre-2009? and that ?we need to obviously look to the past, but in
our opinion this proceeding is not about punishing for past behavior, it?s about the future and the
present responsibility of Computech under new leadership. 17?

Mr. Donnini is accurate in noting that much of Mr. Kancharla?s misconduct occurred
several years ago. The bribery in Atlanta was in January 2007 and the bribery involving Mr.
Dodd was in 2009.13 The OIG also now recognizes that the payments made to Mr. Dodd after
2009 were part of Mr. Kancharla?s cooperation with the government. While the OIG
acknowledges that the actions in question occurred several years ago, it is necessary to note that
Mr. Kancharla?s cooperation with the government began only after he was caught producing
altering documentation in response to a federal grand jury subpoena, a very serious offense
involving intentional fraud. Additionally, no one at the City of Detroit was made aware of Mr.
Kancharla and Mr. Dodd?s actions until October of 2016. Despite our serious concerns
regarding Mr. Kancharla and Computech?s abilities to act as responsible contractors at the time,
the OIG was asked to put our investigation on hold until the federal investigation was completed.

The OIG is in agreement with Mr. Donnini that Mr. Kancharla and Computech?s past
behavior must be considered with their present and future behavior. The OIG acknowledges and
applauds Computech?s proactive approach to strengthening its corporate policies and procedures
as well as making some leadership changes in an effort to prevent such improper, unethical, and
illegal conduct from occurring again. However, based on the evidence presented, the OIG ?nds

that Computech has not done enough to fully alleviate our concerns about their ability to act as
responsible contractors.

During the administrative hearing, Computech CEO Gregory Cheesewright stated that
what Mr. Kancharla did was contrary to his duties as the CEO as well as the company?s policies
at the time. Mr. Cheesewright argued that Mr. Kancharla?s actions should not be attributed to
the company even though he was CEO of Computech during the time the improper, unethical,
and illegal conduct occurred. 19

Changes in Computech?s Company Culture and Leadership

In support of his argument, Mr. Cheesewright described Computech?s company culture at
the time the bribery occurred. According to Mr. Cheesewright, fostered an atmosphere where
people in the company were competing with one another to be Mr. Kancharla?s ?right-hand
man.20? individuals ?would literally not even like each other? if they knew someone was
outperforming them.21 Mr. Cheesewright explained that individuals were allowed to work in
?silos? so employees did not know what was going on within the company.22 This created a

situation where people were in competition with each other to get ahead.23

Mr. Cheesewright explained that this culture of ?silos? was so pervasive that he knew
nothing of the bribery until Mr. Kancharla showed him an organization chart that had Mr.
Cheesewright listed as the CEO.24 Mr. Cheesewright also claimed the people he has ?working at
the headquarters? and his president had nothing to do with the improper, unethical, and illegal
conduct.25 However, the people working at Computech, especially those in leadership, have
remained largely unchanged since the improper conduct occurred.

As the chart below indicates, six (6) individuals who were on the organization chart in
2015 remained in the executive positions in 2018. This includes Gregory Cheesewright and
Sachin Shrivan who presumably lead Computech as the CEO and president.

Mr. Cheesewright indicated that he is working to change the culture of Computech and
we have no reason not to believe him based on his testimony and evidence presented to the OIG.
He stated he is working to create a more open environment in which employees do not work in
silos but, instead, work more cooperatively with each other. However, this process takes time.
Many of the individuals who were part of the executive management team under Mr. Kancharla
are in the same or similar positions under Mr. Cheesewright. These are the same individuals
who worked in ?silos? according to Mr. Cheesewright. While a cultural shift may be occurring
under Mr. Cheesewright?s leadership, the OIG believes that it is not currently in the best interest
of the City of Detroit or its citizens to work with a contractor whose leadership is largely the
same as when the bribery of public of?cials occurred.

Changes in Computech?s Ownership

In addition to few changes being made to the leadership of Computech, the ownership of
Computech remains largely unchanged. Therefore, those who bene?ted from Mr. Kancharla?s
bribery of public of?cials could continue to bene?t from any contracts awarded by the City of
Detroit. The ownership of Computech during the time the improper, unethical, and illegal
conduct occurred versus how it exists today is detailed below:

 

26 These individuals were on the February 16, 2015 organization chart but were not listed at the executive members.
However, the October 24, 2018 has these employees listed as executive members.

On January 1, 2017, Mr. Kancharla divested his ownership interest in Computech to his
wife, Sreevani Kancharla. As to his children, Sunil Kancharla and Sai Krishna Kancharla, their
shares remain unchanged. On March 31, 2017, Mr. Kancharla resigned from his management
positions at Computech.

Despite Mr. Kancharla relinquishing his management positions and transferring his
shares, the evidence suggests Mr. Kancharla continued to work for Computech since the bribery
allegations came to light in October 2017. Moreover, Mr. Kancharla?s wife and children
continue to hold just short of 50% (49.87% to be exact) of Computech?s ownership.

Mrs. Kancharla also sits on the Board which consists of the same individuals who have
ownership interest in Computech.28 Mr. Cheesewright stated during the administrative hearing
that owners do not make any business decisions. However, they receive pro?ts at the end of the
year.29 Therefore, Mr. Kancharla, through his wife, continues to benefit from the success of

Computech.
Computech?s Board of Directors

On March 26, 2019, the Board passed the Computech Corporation Written Consent
Resolutions of the Board of Directors which

resolved that the net pro?t realized by the corporation during any
calendar year from any contract awarded to the corporation by
Detroit over the next ?ve (5) years shall be segregated from funds
otherwise available for distribution to the stockholders of the
corporation, and shall be used to fund bonuses to be paid to the

name spelled as ?Srivani.?

persons holding (as of December 31 of such calendar year) the
following of?cer positions in the corporation in the percentages
indicated opposite their positions, such bonuses to be paid annually
within sixty days of such calendar year-end with respect to net pro?t
from Detroit contracts, if any, realized in such calendar year:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Officer Percentage of Net Pro?t
Chief Executive Of?cer 25%
President 25%
Vice President, Finance Operations 25%
Vice President, Cloud Computing 12.5%
Vice President, Strategic Development 12.5%

 

This arose out of a concern that the net pro?ts from any such
contract not inure to the bene?ts of Ram Kancharla, a former
shareholder of the Corporation, indirectly through shares held by
any current shareholder.

The resolution shall cease to be of any further force or effect upon
the consummation of any transaction during the next ?ve (5) years
as a results of which Ram Kancharla cease to be the direct or indirect
bene?ciary of any potential Detroit contracts.

The OIG recognizes Computech?s attempt to limit any bene?ts derived from contracts
with the City of Detroit to Mr. Kancharla. However, this resolution does not go far enough. The
OIG proposed a twenty (20) year debarment for Computech and Mr. Kancharla based on the
guidelines of the Debarment Ordinance. Section 18-11-12 of the Debarment Ordinance states
that any conviction incident to a contract with the City of Detroit, including bribery, is subject to
a twenty (20) year debarment. However, the resolution only contemplates the next ?ve (5) years
which the OIG ?nds is an inadequate solution. Because of the harm Mr. Kancharla?s actions
caused the City of Detroit as well as the harm it caused to the citizens? trust in the honesty and
integrity of government contracting, the OIG ?nds that Computech is not a responsible
contractor with whom the City of Detroit should be doing business with at this time.

Mr. Kancharla?s Continued Employment with Computech

On June 28, 2017, Computech CEO Ram Kancharla pleaded guilty to tampering with
documents. It is also undisputed that he participated in the bribery of public of?cials in Detroit
and Atlanta. Despite the seriousness of Mr. Kancharla?s actions and the harm it caused to
Computech and its employees, Mr. Kancharla was hired by the company to work as an
independent contractor.

During the administrative hearing, Mr. Cheesewright admitted Mr. Kancharla became an
independent contractor after he resigned. It was also at this time that Mr. Cheesewright became

Page 10 of 13

CEO.30 Mr. Kancharla?s O?er for Independent Contractor Services states that it ?is with great
pleasure that we offer you this offer from Computech Corporation, seeking your services as an
independent contractor.? He was contracted as the Project Manager/ Software Architect for the
Vision Insurance Management Services project. The contract was for a term of nine (9) months
and his compensation was $90,000. Mr. Kancharla?s job as an independent contractor ended in
August 2018.31 Currently, he is not employed with Computech in any capacity.

Mr. Kancharla engaged in illegal behavior that damaged Computech?s reputation,
negatively impacted Computech?s employees, and called into question the company?s ability to
act as a responsible contractor. Computech had an opportunity to end its working relationship
with Mr. Kancharla to send a message to all employees that such actions will not be tolerated.
Instead, the company continued its relationship with Mr. Kancharla. This calls into question
Computech?s commitment to act as a responsible contractor and its willingness to do whatever is
necessary to ensure such actions do not occur in the future.

On March 18, 2019, Mr. Cheesewright submitted an af?davit to the OIG. It stated, in
part, that

As CEO of Computech, I have no present intention of hiring Mr.
Kancharla as a employee or engaging Mr. Kancharla as an
independent I hereby declare and undertake that so
long as I remain in my current position, and in my of?cial capacity,
Computech will neither hire Mr. Kancharla as an employee nor
engage him as an independent contractor in the future on any
Speci?c projects.

This af?davit was submitted to the OIG only after we raised concerns about Mr.
Kancharla?s potential future involvement with Computech. In a previous af?davit dated October
15, 2018, Mr. Cheesewright stated

In 2017, Mr. Ram Kancharla resigned from Computech. Since that
time, Mr. Kancharla?s role with the company has been limited to
writing code on an independent contractor basis on one project. His
work on that project is complete, however he may be called to
perform similar work on an as needed basis.

Computech ?red Mr. Aramugum for his role in the bribery. Yet the company continued
to do business with Mr. Kancharla, the individual who approved the payments for the bribery
and then gave orders to alter documentation to cover it up. Therefore, the OIG simply cannot
recommend that the City of Detroit does business with a contractor who seemed reluctant to
distance itself from someone who engaged in illegal conduct because he was able to perform a
task bene?cial to the company.

Remedial Actions Taken By Computech

Nevertheless, because Computech has taken some remedial actions on its own to prevent
future wrongdoing and because we want to encourage the wrongdoers to change and to correct
their paths, we do not recommend the maximum debarment of twenty (20) years in this instance.
Computech has fully cooperated with the OIG investigation and has provided the OIG with
evidence that it has taken steps on its own to institute new policies and procedures aimed at
preventing improper, unethical, and illegal conduct from occurring in the ?lture.

Mr. Cheesewright proactively updated the company?s Employee Handbook, including how
expenses are reimbursed.32 Based on the handbook, two (2) members of the Executive Board
must independently review reimbursement requests. Receipts and documentation must be
submitted to substantiate all requests for approval.33 An Ethics Policy Addendum was also
completed, effective April 2018.34 Further, Computech conducts annual compliance training so
all employees are aware of the company?s policies and procedures.35 Finally, Computech no
longer has a bonus structure for certain employees involved with the company?s public sector
business.36

For these reasons, the OIG ?nds that a period of ten (10) years is an appropriate length of
debarment.

Conclusion

Based on the evidence above, the OIG ?nds that Computech is not a responsible
contractor. Mr. Kancharla and Mr. Aramugum have engaged in improper, unethical, and illegal
conduct in the City of Detroit contracting process at the expense of the citizens of Detroit.
Documentation and testimony provided on behalf of Computech suggests that the company?s
culture contributed to these actions. Though Computech has started to take steps to prevent this
from occurring in the future, more needs to be done.

Computech has argued that the company has made it a priority to help residents in the
City of Detroit and is a signi?cant contributor to the city?s economy and therefore should not be
debarred.3?7 The OIG does not dispute that Computech?s achievements towards making the City
a better place, such as buying and rehabilitating old buildings in Detroit; working with the
churches in the City, Wayne State University, and Detroit Historical Museum; and hiring Detroit
residents. However, Computech?s conduct under Mr. Kancharla?s leadership and its continued
ties to Mr. Kancharla, however minimal, cannot easily be dismissed. Every action a contractor
takes or does not take has consequences and every contractor must be held accountable for their
actlons.

 

32 This process began on June 23, 2017 and was ?nalized in January 2018.

Request for Hearing, dated October 15, 2018.

Page 12 of 13

Computech has also expressed concem about the impact being debarred from the City of
Detroit would have on their current and future business.38 The DIS is very cognizant of the
serious nature of debarment and the consequences it may have on a company. However, the OIG
is tasked with ensuring that the City solicits offers from and awards contracts to responsible
contractors only. The serious nature of debarment requires that it is only imposed when it is in
the public interest. Therefore, the OIG ?nds debarment to be in the public interest in this
instance.

Section 18-11-12(a) of the Debarment Ordinance states that

The period for debarment shall be commensurate with the
seriousness of the cause or causes therefore, but in no case shall the
period exceed 20 years. Generally, debarment should not exceed
?ve years, except: (1) Debarment for convictions of criminal
offenses that are incident to the application to, or performance of, a
contract or subcontract with the City, including but not limited 
bribery, falsi?cation or destruction of records. ..

The OIG wants to encourage companies whose leadership and employees engage in
improper, unethical, or illegal behavior to proactively identify de?ciencies within their
companies that allowed such behavior to occur and correct it. These companies should also act
swiftly and decisively against those whose actions are in question. Computech has changed their
policies and procedures in an attempt to prevent future issues. However, the company did not act
decisively against Mr. Kancharla but instead allowed him to continue to work for Computech.
Based on these reasons, the OIG ?nds that Computech should be debarred from contracting and
subcontracting with the City of Detroit for a period of ten (10) years.

Attn: Ray Solomon Monique Phillips

Dear Ray and Monique,

On behalf of the Quicken Loans Community Fund (QLCF) and the Family of Companies, I would
like to congratulate you and the City of Detroit for receiving an AmerlCorps VISTA Grant from
the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to support the placement of 7 full-
time VISTA members, one dedicated for each of the 7 Districts in Detroit.

VISTAS are leading outreach efforts on behalf of the Department of Neighborhoods (DON) that
provide assistance to each of the city's District Managers (7 total] by supporting the creation
and expansion efforts of block clubs, assessing biight remediation programs, and expanding
economic opportunities for residents through tax foreclosure prevention. VISTAS use the
laptops to perform a number of vital functions such as: tracking and entering all constituent
information into a tracking tool to document their concerns -- a function that helps the District
Managers maintain accurate and current records and address concerns in a timely fashion;
e-mailing and corresponding with constituents; creating documents to help start block clubs
and supporting capacity building for them; organizing meeting materials; implementing
resource mapping, and; submitting departmental reports, among many others.

We also understand that the CNCS AmeriCorps Grant does not provide computers for the
VISTAs, and that the seven AmeriCorps VISTA members will each need access to a computer as
soon as possible. QLCF is committed to making a laptOp donation consisting of (S) Refurbished
Deli 7740 LaptOps valued at $475 each and New Dell Latitude 3480 valued at $700 each, to
support the activities of these new VISTA members. Beginning immediately, you may pick up
the computers at the following address: One Campus Martins, 1050 Woodward Avenue,
Detroit, MI. The computers are currently being offered solely on a 90-day extended trial basis,
which can be further extended to 180-days at the request of either QLCF or the City. This trial
period is designed to determine whether the software and operating system of the computers

Cr

are compatible with the needs of the VISTA members. Contingent upon the Detroit City Council
and the Mayor's approval of a donation of the computers by QLCF to the City, and upon a
mutual agreement between QLCF and the City that the computers ?t the needs of the VISTA
members, QLCF will permanently donate the computers to the City. The stated value is $4,475.

The Quicken Loans Community Fund (QLCF) is not responsible for replacement or repair of any
lost, stolen, or damaged computers. At the end of the project term, the computers may be used
to support additional VISTA members or other volunteers and/or the Department of
Neighborhoods. expects that the City will treat the computers with the same level of care
given to other City owned technology and equipment.

Please accept this donation on behalf of QLCF as a symbol of our continued support of the
Department of Neighborhoods within the City of Detroit and the CNCS AmeriCorps VISTA
program. Please reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.

RE: DDOT Remanufactured Engines and Transmissions

 

I had several questions concerning line item #22 from today?s Public Health and Safety
Standing Committee Meeting. I would like to know how many coaches are currently in

the DDOT ?eet and what is the age of those coaches?

With regard to the extended warranty on the Cummins Remanufactured Engines and
Transmissions, I am concerned about the length and terms of the warranty. What is the

current average annual mileage that DDOT coaches are accruing?

With regard to midlife coaches, on average, how many miles are they accruing before
requiring an engine and transmission rebuild? How many miles, on average, can a coach

with a rebuilt powertrain be expected to accrue before having to be taken out of service?

If you have any questions, please contact my of?ce at 313-224-4535.
