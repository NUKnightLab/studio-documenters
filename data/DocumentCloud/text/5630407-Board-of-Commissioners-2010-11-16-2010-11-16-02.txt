GENERAL BACKGROUND
To support the Plan for Transformation in 2004, CHA Resident Services implemented the webbased software application, Salesforce.com, to meet the needs of its Service Connector program.
Over time, and through the transition to the Family Works program, Resident Services has added
significant components to the Salesforce.com implementation. Most of the day-to-day activities
performed by CHA Resident Services providers are conducted through the Salesforce.com
platform. In 2005, CHA’s Housing Choice Voucher program installed a separate instance of the
Salesforce.com solution for its Call Center. The system allows HCV to track incoming phone
calls through detailed notes and the creation of cases. These cases are then assigned to
appropriate HCV personnel for resolution. Salesforce.com allows HCV to track the volume of
cases, the percentage that are successfully resolved and any outstanding cases that should be
escalated for proper resolution.
Although both Resident Services and the HCV program were using the same technology
solution, the implementations are distinct and not integrated. While the Salesforce.com platform
provides many benefits to Resident Services and HCV, the implemented solution left some key
needs unmet, particularly being able to understand all actions that were impacting a participant
over the course of their participation in CHA programs.
CHA began envisioning a new, comprehensive Client Management Tracking System (CMTS)
that would provide a holistic overview of each resident and participant in CHA’s housing
programs. Over time, the vision became solidified as an integrated solution that would meet the
ongoing needs of Contract and Case Management Services for Resident Services, Housing
Choice Voucher Call Center, and other Customer Contact Tracking (e.g. Corporate Relations and
Grants). Market research was conducted to better understand what technologies are available
“out-of-the-box” and with minimum customization.
A variety of software vendors were contacted for information and product demonstrations. In
addition, many internal interviews were conducted with current users of the Salesforce.com
technology in the Housing Choice Voucher and Resident Services programs to understand how
the software is being used and what new functionality might be beneficial to CHA. After
reviewing the current market for Customer Relationship Management software technologies,
including the product already in use by the CHA, a Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued by
the CHA with detailed Business and Technical Requirements to ensure that potential vendors
understood the complete business needs of the CHA.

 PROCUREMENT HISTORY
On January 25, 2010 the CHA advertised Request for Proposal No. 10-00479 for Client
Management Tracking System services. The solicitation sought both Software and
Implementation Services for the CMTS initiative. Prior to release of the RFP, over 40 potential
bidders were contacted to encourage them to review the RFP, and possibly submit a bid if they
were interested. On February 11, 2010, CHA held a Pre-Proposal Conference where 28 potential
vendors attended in person and via conference call.
The initial due date for the proposals was March 1, 2010, however due to three addendums and
two vendors requesting extensions, the due date was changed to March 3, 2010 at which time
CHA received 8 separate proposals. The Evaluation Team, comprised of representatives from
Information Technology Services, Resident Services, Housing Choice Voucher and Public
Housing, reviewed each Proposal and provided their individual scoring results to Procurement.
The Procurement Department set a competitive range that resulted in six of the eight vendors
being selected. After Oral Presentations were completed, all scoring was submitted and the
second competitive range was set that resulted in two finalists to move forward through the
negotiation process. The CMTS Team worked with both finalists on the development of a
Statement of Work (SOW), including a detailed project schedule and pricing information that
would assist CHA in selecting the vendor who would implement the best solution.
Upon careful evaluation of each of the vendor’s software products, implementation approaches
and pricing, the CMTS Team recommended Model Metrics as the proposed awardee for the
Client Management Tracking System project. The determination was based upon technical,
pricing and other factors, and was the result of the evaluation team’s conclusion that Model
Metrics’ proposal represented the best solution and overall value to the CHA for the CMTS
project. Model Metrics’ Best and Final offer proposes Salesforce.com’s “Software as a
Solution” (SAAS) product, which is a 100% outsourced, hosted solution. The Salesforce.com
software solution was most cost effective with a less complicated pricing model and significantly
lowers total cost of ownership. For the end user, the system is easier to navigate, very user
friendly and appealing. For the power users and technical staff, the product is much easier to
manage, configure and extend when changes are needed. Finally, Salesforce.com and Model
Metrics are proven partners with the CHA with a demonstrated implementation history.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to enter a contract with Model
Metrics, Inc. and Salesforce.com to provide a Client Management Tracking System in the total
fixed-fee project amount of $2,270,592, which includes funding for the two year base and the
respective options for: (i) Salesforce.com licensing for year 3 of the agreement; and (ii)
additional consulting services from Model Metrics that would be expected to be completed
within one year of the CHA’s exercise of the optional consulting services, when and if elected.
Specifically, this request includes funding for the implementation phase of the project in the
fixed-fee amount of $990,780 with optional Consulting Services in the amount of $137,280 with
Model Metrics, Inc., and User License fees with Salesforce.com for a total fixed-fee amount of
$780,612 for the two year base term and $361,920 for the option year term.
