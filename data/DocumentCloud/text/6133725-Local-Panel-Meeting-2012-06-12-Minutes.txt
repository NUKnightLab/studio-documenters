BOARD ACTIONS
1.
Case No. L-RC-11-024
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 31/ City of Chicago

Chairman Gierut called the case, noting that no party filed exceptions to ALJ Tarver’s RDO and asked whether the
Board wished to review the decision on its own motion. The Board declined to do so.
2.
Case No. L-CA-10-035
Laura Foster/ Chicago Transit Authority
Chairman Gierut recused himself from the case. General Counsel Post called the case noting that no party filed
exceptions to ALJ Bell’s RDO and asked whether the Board wished to review the decision on its own motion. The
Board declined to do so.
3.
Case No. L-CA-10-058
Samuel Ware/ City of Chicago
Chairman Gierut called the case, noting that Executive Director Brosnan issued a dismissal on April 18, 2012, with
an appeal filed. General Counsel Post reviewed the issues presented by Charging Party’s appeal which alleges a
violation of Section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act. General Counsel Post recommended
that the Board accept the Executive Director’s dismissal because the Charging Party had not demonstrated any
likelihood of being able to make out a Section 10(a)(1) violation, and could not meet the more difficult task of
demonstrating a Section 10(a)(2) violation. After discussion, Member Anderson made a motion to accept the
General Counsel's recommendation. Member Sadlowski seconded the motion, and the Board passed it
unanimously, by a voice vote.

 VI.

OTHER BOARD MATTERS

The Board opted to review the fiscal and legislative reports in the joint panel meeting scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on
this date. After a short discussion regarding whether there was a need for executive session, the Board concluded
that it was unnecessary at this time.
VII.

ADJOURNMENT

Chairman Gierut called for a motion to adjourn. Member Anderson made a motion to adjourn the meeting, and the
Board passed it unanimously, by a voice vote.
Adopted and approved by the Chairman and Members of the Local Panel of the Illinois Labor Relations
Board, in Chicago, Illinois, this 10th day of July, 2012.
