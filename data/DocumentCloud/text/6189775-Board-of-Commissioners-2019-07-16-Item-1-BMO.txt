Background
BMO Harris Bank N.A. (“BMO Harris Bank” or the “Bank”) is the CHA’s primary cash management
bank and has consistently provided best practice service delivery in a full range of banking products
and services. The CHA’s plan for neighborhood creation and community development can be greatly
enhanced by exercising appropriate financing options available and offered through BMO Harris
Bank. Under Resolution No. 2013-CHA-91, passed October 15, 2013, CHA Board authorization was
granted allowing CHA to obtain a $20 Million secured revolving line of credit from the Bank.
Subsequently, under Resolution No. 2014-CHA-87, passed August 19, 2014, CHA Board authorization
was again sought and granted to expand the secured revolving loan facility option to include
borrowing under an unsecured basis and to broaden the use of such facility to be used for other nonresidential community development initiatives. Further, under Resolution No. 2016-CHA -112, passed
October 18, 2016, CHA board authorized an increase in the amount of the credit facility from $20
Million to $50 Million and to broaden the use of the facility to include providing loans to support
residential and community development activities and/or have other community benefit for CHA.
Under this Board action, CHA is seeking authorization to extend the term of the facility for an
additional 60 months, to decrease the amount from $50 million to $25 million and to authorize the
investment of an amount not to exceed $5.25 million in a joint venture partnership with CIBC Bank
USA related to the acquisition, construction and sales of 56 for sale townhomes as part of the mixedincome redevelopment of Cabrini-Green also known as Parkside 4 Phase 2. The for sale townhomes
are part of a mixed income housing development that the CHA Board authorized on November 20,
2018, (2018-CHA-89) and represents the final phase of the Parkside of Old Town development. In
addition to the for sale townhomes, 102 rental units will be developed in three buildings along with
32 residential rental townhomes, consisting of public housing converting to Section 8 Rental
Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Project-Based voucher units, affordable and market rate units.
