The Board then reviewed of the minutes of the Investment Committee meeting held September 21, 2015.
It was noted by Ms. Tuczak that the Investment Committee meeting minutes reflect a motion that
provides for liquidation of the hedge funds of Aetos and K-2 be utilized for September and October
disbursements. However, based upon recent communication with these two investment managers, the
redemption proceeds will not be available until late October. Ms. Tuczak proposed that the motion from
the July Investment Committee allowing redemption of up-to $40 million from the NTGI Russell 1000
Fund be reinstated and utilized for September benefit payments, as such redemption was not previously
utilized. The hedge fund proceeds can then be used for October and November benefit payments, as
necessary. Ms. Tuczak indicated that Kevin Leonard of NEPC, LLC agrees with such recommendation.
