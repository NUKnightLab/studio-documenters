Prior to the Implementation of the CCHHS EEO Team

 There was a need to internally manage
employee complaints and concerns to
ensure a consistent investigation process;
appropriate application of CCHHS Policies
across the system; application of the level
and type of discipline in accordance with
the infraction

5

 Create a CCHHS EEO Team that will provide
a fair avenue for employees to raise
concerns and ensure appropriate
consistency throughout the process

 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)
What is a Case?
A case is an allegation of a Civil Rights violation and/or an act of workplace violence raised by a complainant
against another employee, multiple employees, or the CCHHS entity as a whole.
What is a Charge?

A charge is the specific type of discrimination that a complainant alleges. Complainant’s often file multiple types of
discrimination, which often cause the number of charges to exceed the number of cases filed.

The outcome of a charge can be one of the following:
•
Substantiated: The results of the investigation found sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the
Complainant’s allegations were valid and either unlawful discrimination and/or a violation of a
CCHHS policy occurred .
•

Unsubstantiated: The results of the investigation found insufficient evidence to demonstrate that
either unlawful discrimination took place or a violation of a CCHHS policy occurred.

•

Non-EEO matter: Case falls outside of the scope of the CCHHS EEO Team’s jurisdiction. An example
includes interdepartmental discord

Who is the Complainant: A person who files
a complaint or charge
8

Who is the Respondent: The person or entity
who provides a response to the complaint or
charge

Handout – EEO Types of Discrimination
Page 25 of 29

 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)
Discrimination by Type
Age - Age discrimination involves treating someone (an applicant or employee) less favorably
because of his or her age. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) only forbids age
discrimination against people who are age 40 or older.
Disability - Disability discrimination occurs when an employer or other entity covered by the
Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, or the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, treats a qualified
individual with a disability who is an employee or applicant unfavorably because she has a disability.
Equal Pay/Compensation - The Equal Pay Act requires that men and women in the same workplace
be given equal pay for equal work. The jobs need not be identical, but they must be substantially
equal. Job content (not job titles) determines whether jobs are substantially equal. All forms of pay
are covered by this law, including salary, overtime pay, bonuses, stock options, profit sharing and
bonus plans, life insurance, vacation and holiday pay, cleaning or gasoline allowances, hotel
accommodations, reimbursement for travel expenses, and benefits wages of either sex to equalize
their pay.

Page 26 of 29

CCHHS Human Resource Committee I 06/17/16

 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)
Discrimination by Type
Genetic Information – Occurs when an employer uses genetic information in making employment
decisions. Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), took effect on
November 21, 2009.
Harassment - Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex
(including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.
National Origin - National origin discrimination involves treating people (applicants or employees)
unfavorably because they are from a particular country or part of the world, because of ethnicity
or accent, or because they appear to be of a certain ethnic background (even if they are not).
National origin discrimination also can involve treating people unfavorably because they are
married to (or associated with) a person of a certain national origin.

Pregnancy – Pregnancy discrimination involves treating a woman (an applicant or employee)
unfavorably because of pregnancy, childbirth, or a medical condition related to pregnancy or
childbirth.

CCHHS Human Resource Committee I 06/17/16

 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)
Discrimination by Type
Race/Color - Race discrimination involves treating someone (an applicant or employee)
unfavorably because he/she is of a certain race or because of personal characteristics associated
with race (such as hair texture, skin color, or certain facial features). Color discrimination involves
treating someone unfavorably because of skin color complexion.
Religion - Religious discrimination involves treating a person (an applicant or employee)
unfavorably because of his or her religious beliefs. The law protects not only people who belong to
traditional, organized religions, such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, but
also others who have sincerely held religious, ethical or moral beliefs.
Retaliation - All of the laws we enforce make it illegal to fire, demote, harass, or otherwise
"retaliate" against people (applicants or employees) because they filed a charge of discrimination,
because they complained to their employer or other covered entity about discrimination on the
job, or because they participated in an employment discrimination proceeding (such as an
investigation or lawsuit).

Sex - Sex discrimination involves treating someone (an applicant or employee) unfavorably
because of that person's sex. Discrimination against an individual because of gender identity,
including transgender status, or because of sexual orientation is discrimination because of sex
in violation of Title VII
Sexual Harassment - It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of
that person’s sex. Harassment can include “sexual harassment” or unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.
Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks
about a person’s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments
about women in general.
