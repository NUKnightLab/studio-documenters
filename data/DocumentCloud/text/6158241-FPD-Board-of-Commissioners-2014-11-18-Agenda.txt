BOARD AGENDA

November 18, 2014

Concurrences:
The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Attorney have approved this item.
Summary: The Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “Preserves”) has received a grant award from the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) to support restoration activities at Wentworth Woods in Calumet City,
Illinois. These USFWS grant funds are provided through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (“GLRI”). This
project will enable the Preserves to work with an experienced ecological contractor to manage invasive species and
thin woody vegetation throughout Wentworth Woods. Active restoration will improve the ecological health of this
site and promote the growth of native ground-layer vegetation that is currently at great risk of decreased diversity
and site extirpation due to alien competition and low light levels. Wentworth Woods retains the original dune and
swale topography that once characterized most of the Calumet Region and demonstrates a strong potential for
ecological restoration.
Total funding amount is $86,000.00, with $43,000.00 being provided as match by the Preserves.
