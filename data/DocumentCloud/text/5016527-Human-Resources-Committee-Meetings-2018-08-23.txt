Report from Interim Chief Human Resources Officer (Attachment #1)
Barbara Pryor, Interim Chief Human Resources Officer, reviewed her report, which included information on the
following subjects:
Impact 2020 – CCHHS HR Strategies
Focus Area 4 – Invest in Resources
Tactic 4.2 Recruit, hire and retain the best employees, who are committed to the CCHHS mission
Tactic 4.3 Strengthen CCHHS workforce
Measurement/Milestones: Reduce time to hire by 15% for non-credentialed positions; achieve substantial
compliance on the Employment Plan
• Healthcare/Focused Recruitment
• Define and track each step in the hiring process
• Enhance position tracking/reporting and analysis
During the discussion of the subject of healthcare/focused recruitment, Chair Richardson-Lowry inquired whether
the organization has a relationship with Chicago State University (CSU). Ms. Pryor responded in the affirmative;
CCHHS jobs are posted at CSU. She added that she can provide more information on that subject. Dr. John Jay
Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, noted that the City Colleges of Chicago strategically focuses different
concentrations at the different sites; that strategy has resulted in most of the healthcare-related professions being
focused at Malcolm X College. He added that the organization’s strongest relationship has been with Malcolm X
College, because of that strategic concentration. Chair Richardson-Lowry stated that CSU’s new President, Z.
Scott, is working to build out the programmatic direction, and this might be a good opportunity to collaborate.
Ms. Pryor agreed; she stated that she has been in contact with President Scott and will continue that dialogue.

Metrics - HR Activity Report:
• Improve / Reduce Average Time to Hire
• HR Activity Report – Open Vacancies
• Hiring Snapshot
• Licensed Nurses Hiring Snapshot
• Revenue Cycle Hiring Snapshot
During the discussion of the metrics on Average Time to Hire, Ms. Pryor stated that the administration is working
to develop more flexibility with the Employment Plan by considering some options to do some things differently.
They are currently in discussions to talk about what those ideas are; at some point she would like to come back to
the Committee to share that information.
Director Thomas inquired whether the nurses in the Licensed Nurses Hiring Snapshot are primarily hospital or
ambulatory-based. Ms. Pryor responded that she will provide that information.
