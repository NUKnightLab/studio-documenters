HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF THE
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA)
Page 12 of 180

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

July 1, 2015

WHEREAS, on July 26, 1990, our nation committed itself to the elimination of discrimination against
people with disabilities through the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and
WHEREAS, in 1986, the National Council on Disability (NCD) recommended enactment of an Americans
with Disabilities Act ( ADA), and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House
and Senate in 1988; and
WHEREAS, after the spectacular Senate vote of 76 to 8 on September 7,1989, the Bill went to the House
where it was considered by an unprecedented four Committees and later approved and signed as a law; and
WHEREAS, the ADA began with the establishment of the independent living movement, which
challenged the notion that people with disabilities needed to be institutionalized, and which fought for and
provided services for people with disabilities to live in the community; and
WHEREAS, the hard work and the coalescing of lawyers and advocates, top level negotiators and policy
analysts, disability organizations, lobbyers, protesters, witnesses, and many more groups from all areas of
the country formed the disability rights movement to help the passage of the ADA; and
WHEREAS, people with disabilities went to Washington D.C. to talk to members of Congress, to advocate
for the Bill, and to explain why each provision was necessary while others wrote letters, attended town
meetings, and made endless phone calls; and
WHEREAS, for the first time, the exclusion and segregation of people with disabilities was viewed as
discrimination; and
WHEREAS, before the ADA, no federal law prohibited private sector discrimination against people with
disabilities, outside a federal grant or contract; and
WHEREAS, the ADA is a wide-ranging civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on a disability
and offers similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics
illegal; and
WHEREAS, the ADA protects people with both mental and physical disabilities regardless of the severity
or permanency of such disability; and
WHEREAS, the ADA requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees
with disabilities, and imposes accessibility requirements on public accommodations; and
WHEREAS, the ADA was created on a basic presumption that people with disabilities want to work and
capable members of their communities and that exclusion and segregation cannot be tolerated; and
WHEREAS, due to the passage of the ADA, persons with a disability continue to be treated with dignity
and accommodating them is no longer a matter of charity; but a basic issue of civil rights.

WHEREAS, all people regardless of their sexual orientation benefit from fulfilling and meaningful
relationships that are epitomized in their public and legal recognition through marriage; and

WHEREAS, on December 3, 1996, following the world's first-ever trial on the freedom to marry, led by
co-counsel Dan Foley and Evan Wolfson, Judge Kevin Chang rules that the state did not have a legitimate
reason for depriving same-sex couples of the freedom to marry; and
WHEREAS, in August 2010 CNN released the first poll to show a national majority supporting the

married and have their marriage recognized by law as valid?," and 52 percent of the respondents said yes,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Toni Preckwinkle, on behalf of the residents of Cook
County, do hereby laud the LGBT community for its steadfast commitment to equality and recognize that

submitted to the Board later this fiscal year.
Brighton Park Neighborhood Council: This program will operate in Kelly High School, Davis
Elementary, and Shields Middle School. It will serve 80 13 -19 year old at risk youth. The program will
offer mentoring, restorative justice, trauma-informed counseling, afterschool tutoring and civic
engagement and case management. The goal is to decrease truancy, conflict with the law and decrease
violence involvement. Additionally, the program seeks to increase protective factors for the youth such
as positive decision-making, academic performance, and leadership. Youth will only enter the program
if they meet certain risk requirements including: chronic truancy, criminal justice or probation
involvement, and chronic disciplinary or behavioral problems at school. The program serves the
Brighton Park neighborhood.
Enlace Chicago: The program is called the “Little Village Youth Safety Network.” It is a prevention
targeted program for youth in 5th through 8th grade. Program components include parental engagement,
mental health treatment, mentoring, after school mentoring, and leadership development. The
partnership includes a large amount of smaller community based organizations to create the “Little
Village Youth Safety Network” which includes a shared database between all agencies. Youth will be
identified using CPS early indicator data. The program will serve the Little Village community. The
identified partner agencies are: (1) Beyond the Ball; (2) Central States SER; (3) Chicago Youth Boxing

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

in all aspects of the youths life. Advocates will help the youth identify personal goals and work towards
them while also staying in compliance with probation. Advocates accompany the youth to court, help
them enroll in school, take them to appointments and whatever else is necessary to keep the youth safe
and on track. There is a no eject no reject policy, meaning every youth referred by probation will be
accepted and none will be ejected regardless of behavior. The program proposal is to serve youth
County-wide, but referrals will be determined by Juvenile Probation and, therefore, may be concentrated
in a certain area.
Illinois African American Coalition for Prevention: The program is titled the “Youth Asset
Development Project.” With three partner agencies the program will provide Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (evidence based practice), mentoring, and balanced and restorative justice training for 117 youth
ages 14-18, who are at risk of violence involvement. The program will serve the communities of
Roseland, Auburn-Gresham, Englewood, and Greater Grand Crossing. The identified partner agencies

Summary: The Bureau of Technology requests that this Board approve an extension and increase to

allow the vendor to continue providing operational support, proactive network performance monitoring,
project staffing and management, tier one help desk through tier four escalation/problem resolution
services, security analyses, and firewall administration for the Countywide Local Area Network (“LAN”)
and Wide Area Network (“WAN”). Without this service, communication throughout Cook County will
be greatly impacted and key customers to the Bureau of Technology, such as Public Safety, Life Safety,
and elected official agencies would be adversely affected. This extension will allow a smooth transition
between the current support team and the future support team upon conclusion of a corresponding RFP
process.
In 2009, Competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING CALLING UPON THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT TO
COMMUNICATE AND COORDINATE WITH THE COOK COUNTY SHERIFF’S POLICE TO
ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF “STOP AND FRISK,” BY REVIEWING THE
POLICIES OF THE SHERIFF RELATED TO MOTOR VEHICLE STOPS, SEARCHES AND
SEIZURES, SUPERVISORY RANK AND RESPONSIBILITY AND DETENTIONS
WHEREAS, despite the fact that the nation’s attention has turned to police practices because of high
profile killings, concerns about policing extend beyond the use of force and into the everyday interactions
of police with community members; and,
WHEREAS, in black and Latino communities, these everyday interactions are often a “Stop and Frisk”;
and,
WHEREAS, under the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), officers are
allowed to stop you if the officer has reasonable suspicion that you have been, are, or are about to be
engaged in criminal activity. Once you are stopped, if an officer has reasonable suspicion that you are
dangerous and have a weapon, the officer can frisk you, including ordering you to put your hands on a wall
or car, and running his or her hands over your body; and,
WHEREAS, a report on “Stop and Frisk” police practices by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
of Illinois, published this past Spring, contains troubling signs that the Chicago Police Department has a
current practice of unlawfully using stop and frisk; and,
WHEREAS, “Stop and Frisk” is disproportionately concentrated in the black community. Last month’s
ACLU Report found that black Chicagoans were subjected to 72% of all stops, though they constitute just
32% of the city’s population; and,
WHEREAS, the ACLU of Illinois, comparing stops to population, found that Chicagoans were stopped
more than four times as often as New Yorkers at the height of New York City’s stop and frisk practice;
and,
WHEREAS, the abuse of stop and frisk is a violation of individual rights, but it also poisons police and
community relations and directly impacts the bottom line for Cook County taxpayers by leading to arrests
that would not have otherwise occurred, thereby burdening Cook County Courts and the Cook County Jail;
and,
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff operates pursuant to four specific policies that govern the
procedures of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police related to “stop and frisk,” namely the following: Section
500 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Supplemental Manual dealing with Motor Vehicle Stops; Section
312 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual dealing with Searches and Seizures; Section 201
of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual on Supervisory Rank and Responsibilities; and Section
421 of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police Policy Manual on Detentions; and,
WHEREAS, all units of county and local government stand to benefit by exchanging information

regarding best practices;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County President and the Board of
Commissioners that the Chicago Police Department be urged to review the above-referenced policies of
the Cook County Sheriff’s Police, and meet with the Chief of the Cook County Sheriff’s Police to discuss
the manner in which these policies are implemented and whether these policies might be directly
transferable to the work of the Chicago Police Department, particularly regarding “Stop and Frisk.”

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

July 1, 2015

PRIVATE PERSONS AND ENTITIES
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a Home Rule Unit of Government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6; and,
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform
any function relating to its government and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of the
public health, safety, morals and welfare; and,
WHEREAS, the official seal of Cook County (“County Seal”) is an important symbol of the government
of Cook County which is used by Cook County government officials, departments and agencies to convey,
and does convey, the official imprimatur of the Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, when members of the public see the County Seal on any communication or object, they are
likely to believe, and do reasonably believe, that the person or entity displaying the County Seal is a Cook
County government official, department or agency, and that the communication or object has been
approved by a Cook County government official, department or agency; and thus the display of the County
Seal communicates official approval by Cook County government and an association with official Cook
County government business; and
WHEREAS, from time to time, private persons or entities have displayed the County Seal on various
communications and objects with the intent and/or the effect of misleading and confusing members of the
public into believing that the private person or entity is acting as a representative of the Cook County
government and/or acting on official Cook County business; and
WHEREAS, examples of potential fraudulent misuse of the County Seal include, but are not limited to,
the use of the County Seal on letters from non-government entities offering property tax appeal assistance
under the ruse of gathering sensitive personal financial information and the use of the County Seal by
private persons to gain entry to the residences and workplaces of people living and doing business in Cook
County under the false pretense of being Cook County government officials or employees; and
WHEREAS, such fraudulent use of the County Seal puts the most vulnerable members of the public at
financial and physical risk and creates a public safety danger;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Part I
General Ordinances, Chapter 2 - Administration, Article I - In General, Section 2-1 of the Cook County
Code is hereby amended as follows:

(d) No person, as defined by §1-3 of this Chapter of the Cook County Code of Ordinances, shall use or
display any image or likeness of the seal described in this section for the purpose of conveying, or in a
manner that is reasonably likely to convey, the false impression of endorsement, sponsorship or approval
by the government of Cook County or by any official, department, agency or instrumentality thereof. Any
person violating this provision shall be ordered to cease and desist in such use and shall be subject to a fine
as set forth by the Cook County Board of Commissioners in Chapter 32, section 32-1 of this Code. The
determination as to the imposition of penalties under this Section shall be determined in the Cook County
Department of Administrative Hearings pursuant to Chapter 2, Article IX, of the Cook County Code of
Ordinances. Nothing herein prohibits a duly authorized Cook County official, or a person acting under
his or her direction, from using or displaying any image or likeness of the seal described in this section.
(d) (e) Custody. The official seal shall be kept in the custody of the County Clerk to be used by the County
Clerk when required.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners,

THE HONORABLE RICHARD R. BOYKIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
ESTABLISHING THE COMMISSION ON COOK COUNTY YOUTH
WHEREAS, there are approximately 1.2 million children residing in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, in 2014 Raj Chetty, Professor of Economics at Harvard University, and Nathaniel Hendren,
Assistant Professor of Economics at Harvard University completed a comprehensive “Equality of
Opportunity” study of the Causal Effects of Growing Up in Each of the 100 Largest Counties in the United
States on Household Income, with household income at age 26 being a key indicator of a socially,
economically, and educationally successful childhood; and
WHEREAS, the above-referenced “Equality of Opportunity Study,” applying the above criteria ranked
DuPage County number one (1) in the United States in terms of successful childhood outcomes; and
WHEREAS, the same study of the 100 Largest Counties in the United States ranked Cook County number
ninety six (96); and
WHEREAS, the same study of the 100 Largest Counties in the United States ranked Baltimore City number
one hundred (100); and
WHEREAS, the same study of the 100 Largest Counties in the United States and their ultimate impact on
the success of the children that grow up in each of those counties further illustrates that every year a poor

child spends in DuPage County adds about $200 dollars to his or her annual household income at age 26;
and
WHEREAS, the same study of the 100 Largest Counties in the United States and their ultimate impact on
the success of the children that grow up in each of those counties further illustrates that children who move
from Cook County to DuPage County at an early age are less likely to become single parents, more likely
to go to college, and more likely to earn more money; and
WHEREAS, a report issued by Drexel University’s Center for Labor Markets and Policy in January 2015
found an unemployment rate among African American male teens in the City of Chicago of 91%; and
WHEREAS, a report issued by the University of Chicago Crime Lab in March of 2009 examining gun

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE ROBERT STEELE, JERRY BUTLER, JESÚS G. GARCÍA, JOHN A.
FRITCHEY and JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
A RESOLUTION URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO MAINTAIN FULL
MEDICAID FUNDING
WHEREAS, high quality, accessible healthcare is critical to the well-being of Cook County residents, the
local and state economies and to a prosperous and vibrant future for the County; and
WHEREAS, hospitals in Cook County and hospitals throughout the state have been recognized for
providing high quality, accessible health care to Illinoisans; and
WHEREAS, hospitals in Cook County and hospitals throughout the state face significant budgetary and
health care challenges that demand flexibility and innovative solutions; and
WHEREAS, the state administration in Springfield has proposed a 2016 budget that radically cuts state
Medicaid funding to hospitals, including those in Cook County, by nearly $800 million, which could result
in the loss of more than 12,500 jobs and $1.7 billion in economic activity statewide; and
WHEREAS, Medicaid improves health and access to health services, lowers infant, child and adult
mortality rates and increases the use of critical preventive services, such as prenatal care; and
WHEREAS, Medicaid coverage also virtually eliminates catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenditures
for beneficiaries, providing much-needed financial security and peace of mind; and
WHEREAS, over 3.1 million Illinois residents have Medicaid coverage in some form, with nearly 1.6
million of those being Cook County residents; and
WHEREAS, the administration’s budget proposal would impose a devastating human cost on Illinois
residents by compromising or eliminating access to care; and
WHEREAS, hospitals in Cook County and hospitals throughout Illinois are the cornerstone of a strong and
vibrant local and state health care delivery system; and
WHEREAS, hospitals, in good faith and partnership with the General Assembly, have engaged in many
Page 163 of 180

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

July 1, 2015

collaborations to help the state finance the Medicaid program, including absorbing $380 million in
Medicaid cuts since 2011, and bringing the state more than $1 billion in federal funds annually, including
$400 million to non-hospital providers through the Hospital Assessment Program; and
WHEREAS, hospitals across Illinois are major economic engines and employers for local communities
and the state, with hospitals in Cook County serving as one of the largest employers in the community,
supporting an estimated 231,827 in direct and secondary jobs, and with hospitals statewide providing
nearly 450,000 direct and indirect jobs and generating more than $83 billion in economic impact annually;
and
WHEREAS, these Medicaid cuts could jeopardize access to health care services and good paying,
professional jobs; and
WHEREAS, uncertainty in state Medicaid reimbursements could potentially make hospitals vulnerable to
credit downgrades, higher interest rates and loss of access to the capital markets, which could halt capital
and construction projects and limit the direct and indirect economic benefits generated by this key sector
across the state; and
WHEREAS, hospitals cannot absorb these Medicaid cuts, provide quality care to Cook County residents
and transform the Medicaid program and health care delivery at the same time; therefore, be it
THERE FORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the Illinois
General Assembly to oppose and reject the administration’s proposed Medicaid funding cuts to hospitals.
Approved and adopted this 1st of July 2015.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

July 1, 2015

THE HONORABLE PRESIDENT TONI PRECKWINKLE
AMENDMENTS TO THE COOK COUNTY’S HOME RULE RETAILER’S OCCUPATION
AND SERVICE OCCUPATION TAXES
WHEREAS, Cook County Board President, Toni Preckwinkle (“President”) and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners successfully reduced Cook County’s Retailer Occupation and Service Occupation Taxes
(hereinafter referred to as “Sales Tax”) in 2012 and 2013 to address the economic reality at that time and
to promote and ensure operational efficiencies and a streamlined County government; and
WHEREAS, the Sales Tax reduction implemented by the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners allowed approximately one and a half billion dollars to remain in the pockets of Cook
County taxpayers during the 2011 through 2015 fiscal years; and
WHEREAS, the Sales Tax reduction led to a downsized workforce, a reduction in non-essential
expenditures, enhanced collaboration resulting in a more streamlined County government, reductions in
the County’s Health System operating tax allocation, structured capital improvement plans, and a more
efficient government; and
WHEREAS, the President and the County’s Finance Team have undertaken preliminary budget briefings
with members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners to discuss options to further streamline
services as well as evaluate revenue opportunities; and
WHEREAS, given the fiscal challenges facing the County, additional expenditure reductions and new
sources of revenue such as a property tax increase or a sales tax increase, are required to continue moving
Cook County forward and to address its long term needs in a responsible manner so as not to unduly burden
the children and grandchildren of current taxpayers with extensive debt and unfunded pension liabilities;
and
WHEREAS, to serve the interests of current and future County residents and taxpayers, additional revenue
opportunities and expenditure reductions are needed to address actuarially projected shortfalls associated
with the County Officers’ and Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund (“the Annuity Fund”); County legacy
debt service payments; and County road and infrastructure needs; and
WHEREAS, in consideration of feedback provided by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, the
President supports an increase in the County’s Sales Tax in 2016; the purpose behind this increase is to
assist in promoting the long-term financial health of the Annuity Fund, address increasing legacy debt
service payments in a financially prudent fashion, and fund various road and infrastructure needs; and
WHEREAS, through statute, the State of Illinois has established the Annuity Fund as an independent body
politic, separate and apart from Cook County, and has further established statutory rules and systems that
govern the financing for and the measurement standards of annuities associated with the Annuity Fund;
and
WHEREAS, despite the fact that Cook County employees and Cook County taxpayers consistently have
Page 165 of 180

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

July 1, 2015

contributed to the Annuity Fund the full amount permitted by law, the Annuity Fund is on a trajectory of
eventual insolvency within 20 to 25 years; and
WHEREAS, according to current actuarial calculations, the statutory imbalance between contributions
made by employees and taxpayers to the Annuity Fund and the corresponding actuarial and market-based
measurement standards associated with the Annuity Fund increases costs by approximately $1,000,000 per
day; and
WHEREAS, various parties representing County employees, County taxpayers and County executive and
legislative leaders have worked to develop certain State legislative reforms that seek to equitably balance
the interests of all parties to address this imbalance; and
WHEREAS, said State legislative reforms, if enacted into law, could reduce annual annuity-related
actuarial costs, permanently protect and preserve annuities, and deliver a healthcare trust fund and other
significant new value to annuitants; and
WHEREAS, while any action taken by the County must anticipate the possibility of legislative action by
the State of Illinois that could reduce the costs potentially attributable to taxpayers; in the absence of such
legislative action, the County must create the means to contribute additional resources to and reduce
actuarial costs associated with the Annuity Fund when permitted by law; and
WHEREAS, while the President remains hopeful that the State of Illinois will enact said legislative
reforms, it is neither prudent nor fiscally responsible for the County to wait for State legislative reforms
before taking action and a Sales Tax increase would prepare the County to be able to take action in a fair
and responsible manner to help promote the long term health of the Annuity Fund; and
WHEREAS, the Sales Tax increase will allow Cook County to make $55 million in increased annual
legacy debt service payments by Fiscal 2017 without raising the property tax levy by a like amount; and
WHEREAS, the Sales Tax increase will allow Cook County to focus on County-wide road and
infrastructure needs resulting in an anticipated additional funding of $64.5 million annually by 2017 when
compared with 2015 funding via Motor Fuel Taxes; and
WHEREAS, increasing the Sales Tax is not an easy choice; however, Cook County and its leadership must
continue to act responsibly to address the long-term needs of the County’s residents and taxpayers, and
their children and grandchildren.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby support increasing the Cook County Retailers’ Occupation and Service
Occupation Taxes to reduce actuarially projected shortfalls associated with the Annuity Fund, absorb the
County’s legacy debt service increases, and to provide additional funding for road and infrastructure
projects; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President intends to recommend the appropriation of certain
sums attributable to a Sales Tax increase and establish such mechanisms as will result in a greater

contribution of tax receipts to the Annuity Fund as may be permitted by law, a significant increase in the
County’s long-term debt service associated with legacy borrowing from the year 2010 and earlier years,
and additional funding for road and infrastructure projects in the Appropriation Ordinance and Bill for
Fiscal Year 2016; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners do
hereby resolve to look at future reductions to the Cook County Retailers’ Occupation and Service
Occupation Taxes in the event the State of Illinois enacts legislation that reduces the long-term actuarial
costs associated with the Annuity Fund

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
OFFENSES INVOLVING PROPERTY RIGHTS
ARTICLE II. - OFFENSES INVOLVING PROPERTY RIGHTS
Sec. 58-41. - Vandalism and related offenses.
(a)Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Adjudicatory body means a judge assigned to the Circuit Court of Cook County or an administrative law
officer appointed pursuant to Chapter 2, Administration, Article IX, Administrative Hearings, of this Code.
County means (a) any unincorporated area or territory of Cook County, Illinois, and (b) any area of primary
local police enforcement by the Cook County Sheriff's Office as defined by an intergovernmental
agreement between the Sheriff's Office and the local municipality as approved by the Board of
Commissioners. County does not include any area within an incorporated city, village, or town which has
not entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the Sheriff County of Cook which authorizes the
Sheriff to provide primary local police enforcement.
Legal guardian shall include a person appointed guardian, or given custody of a minor by a Circuit Court
of this State, but does not include a person appointed guardian, or given custody of a minor under the
Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (705 ILCS 405/1-1 et seq.).
Minor means a person who has attained 11 years of age but who has not yet reached 18 years of age.
Property shall include any real estate including improvements thereon, and tangible personalty.
(b)Parents or legal guardians held criminally responsible. Acts of vandalism resulting in damage to real
or personal property within the unincorporated areas of the County have increased, posing a threat to the
value of property and the welfare of residents. It is in the best interests of the County that such acts be
prosecuted by the County as a local offense; that penalties therefor be imposed which are related to the
nature of the act and the type of offender; and that parents or legal guardians of minors who allow such
acts to be committed by such minors be held criminally responsible for the failure to prevent the
commission of such acts. The diligent pursuit of such interests will tend to increase parental supervision of
minors and reduce the incidence of juvenile vandalism, thus advancing the welfare of residents of the
County.

(c)Unlawful acts. Within unincorporated Cook County no person shall:
(1)Knowingly or recklessly damage or cause to be damaged any property of another person without his
consent; or
(2)Knowingly and without authority enter into or obtain control over any motor vehicle, bicycle, aircraft
or water craft or any part thereof of another person without his consent.
(d)Penalty for committing unlawful act. It shall be unlawful for any parent or guardian of any minor
living with its parents or guardian to neglect to restrain such minor from committing any act prohibited by
Subsection (c) of this section. The commission of any act prohibited by Subsection (c) of this section by a
minor who is living with its parents or guardian shall raise the presumption that the parent or guardian has
neglected to restrain such minor from committing such act. It shall be an affirmative defense for the parent
or guardian to prove that such parent or guardian exercised his duty to restrain the minor from committing
the act prohibited by Subsection (c) of this section complained of in the pending action, but that such action
on the part of the parent or guardian to attempt to restrain said minor, although exercised with due care,
was unsuccessful.
(e)Violation of Subsection (c). Every person or minor found guilty of an offense under Subsection (c)
of this section shall be subject to either or both of the following penalties:
(1)Fine. A fine not in excess of $1,000.00.
(2)Court Adjudicatory Body supervision.
a.Time period; termination. The court Adjudicatory Body may, without entering a judgment of guilty,
place such person under court Adjudicatory Body supervision for any period not exceeding one year. Such
supervision may include any of the conditions provided for in Subsection (e)(2)b of this section as the court
Adjudicatory Body determines appropriate. If the person completes the period of supervision without
violating the conditions imposed by the Court Adjudicatory Body, the Court Adjudicatory Body shall
discharge the defendant from supervision and dismiss the charge against the defendant. If the person, while
under court Adjudicatory Body supervision, is convicted of any criminal offense in any jurisdiction and
the State's Attorney or municipal prosecutor, as the case may be, moves for termination of supervision, the
Court Adjudicatory Body shall terminate the supervision and enter a judgment of guilty on the plea or
finding.
b.Conditions. The conditions of court Adjudicatory Body supervision may, in addition, require that the
defendant:
1.Work or pursue a course of study or vocational training;
2.Make restitution or reparation in an amount not to exceed actual loss or damage to property and
pecuniary loss or $1,000.00, whichever is less;
Page 173 of 180

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

July 1, 2015

3.Undergo medical or psychiatric treatment, or treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism; and
4.If a minor, to reside with his parent or in a foster home; attend school; attend a nonresidential program
for youth, or contribute to his own support at home or in a foster home.
c.Restitution or reparation. When a court Adjudicatory Body orders restitution or reparation as a
condition for court Adjudicatory Body supervision, the court Adjudicatory Body shall determine the
amount and conditions of payment. When the conditions of payment have not been satisfied, the court
Adjudicatory Body, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period of court Adjudicatory
Body supervision may impose an additional period of not more than two years. Only the conditions of
payment shall continue to apply during such additional period. The court Adjudicatory Body shall retain
all of the incidents of the original sentence, including the authority to modify or enlarge the original
conditions and to revoke the penalty of court Adjudicatory Body supervision if the conditions of payment
are violated during such additional period.
d.Petition charging violation of condition. When the petition is filed charging a violation of a condition
imposed for court Adjudicatory Body supervision, the court Adjudicatory Body:
1.May order a summons to the offender to appear; or order a warrant for the offender's arrest where
there is danger of his fleeing the jurisdiction or causing serious harm to others or when the offender fails
to answer a summons. The issuance of such warrant or summons shall stay the sentence of court
supervision until the final determination of the charge, and the term of court supervision shall not run so
long as the offender has not answered the summons or warrant...
2.Shall conduct a hearing of the alleged violation. The court may admit the offender to bail pending the
hearing.
3.Shall receive evidence in open court with the right of confrontation, cross-examination and
representation by counsel. The County has the burden of going forward with the evidence and proving the
violation by the preponderance of the evidence.
4.Shall not revoke court Adjudicatory Body supervision for failure to comply with conditions of a
sentence which imposes financial obligations upon the offender unless such failure is due to willful refusal
to pay.
5.May modify the conditions of court Adjudicatory Body supervision on motion of the County or on
its own motion or at the request of the offender after notice to all parties and a hearing.
e.Penalty for violation of condition. If the court Adjudicatory Body finds that the offender has violated
a condition at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period, it may continue the offender
on the existing period, with or without modifying or enlarging the conditions, or may impose any other
penalty that was available at the time of the initial penalty.
f.Revocation appealable. A judgment revoking a sentence of court Adjudicatory Body supervision is a
final appealable order.

(f)Penalty for parental neglect to restrain minor. Every person found guilty of an offense under
Subsection (d) of this section shall pay a fine not in excess of $1,000.00.
(g)Parental liability for fine imposed upon minor. The parent or legal guardian of a minor defendant
who resides with such parent or legal guardian shall be liable for any fine or condition of restitution or
reparation imposed by a court Adjudicatory Body upon a minor for violation of this article, provided that
said minor has not paid said fine or made restitution or reparation within the time ordered by the court
Adjudicatory Body, and further provided that said parent or legal guardian has been served with summons
or notice to appear in the original cause against such minor and all proceedings thereafter.
