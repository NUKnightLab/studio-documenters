Statement from Trustee Cowan: I am against this purchase because of the money
issue. It is difficult to see all of these funds leave the System. The Retirees have
suffered enough though bankruptcy, and our members/future Retirees may
continue to suffer. We have been through bankruptcy and as a Trustee, I would
like to see funds spent wisely and I am not satisfied with the cost of this
purchase.
