PROCUREMENT HISTORY
On March 29, 2007, a Request For Qualifications (RFQ) under number #01498-ODM was released by the
Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and The Habitat Company (Habitat) under the Housing for
Chicagoans Everywhere (HCE) program to competitively solicit qualified firms to provide replacement
housing units to the CHA. On October 16, 2007 the CHA Board of Commissioners approved the
authorization to maintain a pre-qualified pool of developers, development teams and multi-unit building
owners, for the specific intention of delivering off-site replacement housing. On March 10, 2008 the
annual HCE solicitation was released in order to expand the existing pool of developers and on June 17,
2008 the CHA Board approved the expansion of the HCE pool and extended the terms of Brinshore
Development, LLC (Brinshore) and Michaels Development Company (Michaels) as eligible HCE pool
members.

Park Douglas (Ogden North) Development Summary
The Park Douglas development (formerly known as Ogden North) will create 158 total housing units,
including the subject of this board item, a 137 unit mixed-income rental development and a future 21 unit
for-sale housing development. This first phase will be generally located in an area bounded by Talman
Avenue to the east, West 13th Place to the south, Fairfield Avenue to the west, and Roosevelt Road to the
north. The 137 rental units will be comprised of 60 public housing, 49 affordable, and 28 market-rate
units. Of the 60 public housing units, 21 units will be located on land previously owned by CHA and the
remaining 39 units will be constructed on land previously owned by the City of Chicago or the developer.
Along with the 137 units of rental housing in Phase 1, there will be an on-site management and leasing
office, maintenance facility, and small community space. The bedroom mix for the 137 rental units is

The Park Douglas project is designed to provide infill development to the existing, stable, housing stock
of 3-flats and single family homes within the immediate project area, and to redevelop portions of the
former Lawndale Complex public housing site. The architectural design of the proposed buildings is
intended to reflect and complement the traditional, historical style of the North Lawndale community.
Phase I will contain a total of nineteen 2-flats, 3-flats, 5-flats, 6-flats, and 9-flat buildings, with two
courtyard structures of 17 and 48 units each . The buildings, reflecting a traditional architectural style,
will be constructed of 100% masonry with limestone accents. The unit types will be mixed throughout
each block, with a solid mix of ACC, affordable, and market rental units in each block, in efforts to create
a strong, mixed income rental community. All buildings will be constructed with the same quality and
materials so that the income levels of residents will be indistinguishable .

 A portion of the land required to construct the development (16 lots) is owned by CHA and will be leased
to Ogden North, LLC through a 99-year ground lease; the balance of the land will be acquired by Ogden
North, LLC in fee simple from the City of Chicago (27 lots) or from B-M Ogden, LLC (9 lots) who
acquired land from private owners. The City of Chicago will transfer title to CHA for seven (7) cityowned vacant lots that will eventually serve as the development site for the 21 for-sale housing units. As
part of the redevelopment, one new street with utilities will be constructed by the Chicago Department of
Transportation to support the new housing development.
Financing:
The total cost of Phase 1 is $43,924,390 and is expected to be funded by the following sources of
permanent financing:
1) $2,750,000 First Mortgage: Enterprise plans to provide the permanent first mortgage loan in the
approximate amount of $2,750,000 with a fixed interest rate to be locked at the time of closing
for a term up to 30 months. The loan is proposed to have a 16-year term and 30-year amortization
period.
2) $9,990,000 CHA ARRA/CFRC Loan: CHA will loan the Capital Fund Recovery Competition
Grant awarded for this development in the amount of $9,990,000 with a term of 40 years, plus
construction period, bearing an interest rate of zero percent or a rate to be determined.
3) $8,289,981 City of Chicago HOME Loan: The City of Chicago will loan approximately
$8,289,981 to the project with a term of 40 years bearing an interest rate of zero percent or a rate
to be determined.
4) $733,878 Illinois Affordable Housing Tax Credit (Donation Tax Credit) Equity: Approximately
$733,878 will be provided from the sale of $917,348 Illinois Donation Tax Credits allocated by
the City of Chicago based on $.80 credit pricing. The credit is generated by CHA’s ground lease
donation value of $1,060,000 and the City’s land donation value of $774,695 to Sinai Community
Institute, Inc., a nonprofit affiliate of Mt. Sinai Hospital that will provide a minimum of 300 hours
of social services annually to the residents of Park Douglas. Immediately upon receiving the
donations at closing, Sinai Community Institute will transfer its interests in both the land and the
tax credit certificates to Ogden North, LLC as a capital contribution.
5) $21,942,431 LIHTC Equity: The LIHTC investor, created by The Richman Group Affordable
Housing Corporation, will provide equity in the approximate amount of $21,942,431. Equity will
be generated by the syndication of approximately $2,743,365 annual federal LIHTC from the
City of Chicago’s Department of Community Development (‘DCD’). The equity amount is based
on a purchase price of $.80 per dollar for the ten year credit allocation. A construction loan in an
amount not to exceed $17,500,000 will be provided by Citi Community Capital, a division of
Citibank, N.A., to bridge a portion of the equity during the construction period, for a term of 26
months (plus one 6-month extension) at an interest rate of 30-Day LIBOR plus an approximate
rate margin of 2.75% on interest only payments.
6) $218,000 Deferred Developer Fee: B-M Ogden, LLC will defer approximately $218,000 of their
total developer fee of $2,567,828 to be reimbursed from cash flow during operations.
Additional project sources include $3,870,944 in CHA Capital funds for demolition costs, Gautreaux
Development Manager fees and other project administrative costs. Site remediation costs are projected for
$259,765 and will be authorized by a separate Board Resolution.
