Assessment classes.
***

all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they
are situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this division, including the land upon
which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are
substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value,
including qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a.

Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage
to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in
such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the
total square footage of the improvements on the parcel. Such real estate must be
either obtained through the Cook County Tax Reactivation Project or must be
located in one of the following designated geographical areas:
1.

An area which has been certified as in need of substantial revitalization
in accordance with the provisions of Section 74-65(b);

b.

Any one of the following five townships: Bloom; Bremen; Calumet;
Rich; and Thornton.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned
property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may
be, may still determine that special circumstances justify that the property is
deemed abandoned for purpose of Class 8. The finding of abandonment, along
with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. Not
withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to
justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where: A.) there has been a
purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or B.) there has been no purchase for value
and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for less than
24 continuous months.
Such resolution or ordinance shall be filed with the eligibility application. If the
ordinance or resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County
Board is required to validate such, a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 8, and a resolution to that effect shall be
included with the Class 8 eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
1.

May be cited as Class 8 Subsection (11)(b)(1) Incentive, Temporary
Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (“Class 8 TEERM”)
Property applying for Class 8 treatment on January 1, 2013 and through

subsection (b):
In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of
abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County
Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances
justify that the property is deemed abandoned for purpose of Class 8. The
finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, shall be included in the resolution or ordinance
supporting and consenting to the Class 8 application. Not withstanding
the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify
finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where: A.) there has been
a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been
vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or B.) there has been no
purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 12 continuous months.

c.

A copy of any resolution received will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to
the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board
from the affected districts.

d.

For industrial and commercial properties this classification shall continue for a
period of 12 years from the date of new construction (excluding demolition, if
any) or substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in the
case of abandoned property, from the date of substantial reoccupancy. During the
tenth year, an application may be filed with the Assessor's Office for renewal of
the incentive for an additional ten year period. This incentive may be renewed
during the last year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the
following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to
request renewal of the incentive from the municipality, or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board,
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution
expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial or commercial use of the property
is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and
consents to renewal of the Class 8; and

3.

A copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed
with the Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent
assessment level period.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the
Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of
the County Board from the affected districts. If, on November 23, 1999, a
property is receiving Class 8 treatment, but the assessment level is higher than 16
percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and
approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, on that effective
date the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is
granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the
current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted.
e. Any property which has applied for Class 8 treatment at the time November 23,
1999, will be eligible for renewal based on the requirements of Subsection (11)
of this section. The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the
property properly applies for and qualifies for Class 8. If no renewal is obtained,
the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 7464. After expiration of the last incentive period the real estate shall revert to the
applicable classification under this division.

Reserved.

g. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure
proper review of the application, supporting data and all other pertinent factors.
h. The certification of an area as in need of substantial revitalization shall expire five
years from the date such certification is granted. The Assessor shall notify the
applicant of the date of expiration of certification one year before the date of the
expiration of the certification. Such certification, pursuant to the same criteria,
may be extended for one additional five-year period subject to reapplication by
the appropriate local governing body within the period from one year to six
months prior to the expiration of the initial five-year period.
i.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by
all Class 8 recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons
employed at the Class 8 site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such
reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of
the incentive for the period covered by the nonfiling.

Effective date: This amended Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

of the best and final offer negotiations.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $311,680.00 (FY 2013: $285,707.00; and FY 2014: $25,973.00). Contract
