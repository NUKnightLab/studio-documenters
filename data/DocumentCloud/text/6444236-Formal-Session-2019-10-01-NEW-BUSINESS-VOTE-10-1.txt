Proposal for Recycling, Clean Up, and Waste Removal Services
Event: Cannabis Cup Vegas

Dates: Sept 9-10

Location: Russell Industrial Center, Detroit, MI

Date Submitted: July 26, 2017
Attn: Sameen Ahmad

Company Overview and Histog

Clean Vibes is a company formed and dedicated to the responsible on-site waste management of
outdoor festivals and events. Our mission is to actively encourage and promote composting, recycling
and proper waste disposal. We hope to educate and inspire a new generation of responsible stewards.
We have a documented record of diverting high levels of festival generated waste from landfills by
increasing the amount of material that is recycled and composted, thereby greatly reducing the
ecological footprint of outdoor festivals and events. With over a fifteen years of experience, Clean Vibes
has a consistent track record of providing results.

Clean Vibes, LLC is a company based in North Carolina with a branch in Vallejo, CA. We are now in our
fifteenth year as an independently owned corporation. The company is fully insured and carries a
general liability policy, a commercial auto policy and a workers compensation policy for the state of
California.

Value to Cannabis Cup

First and foremost, Clean Vibes is committed to providing festivals with a comprehensive. waste
management system. Our goal is to ensure that all facets of the event?s waste collection and cleanup
are effectively managed so that event production staff do not have to worry about this component of
the event. We bring with us the experience of having successfully handled the waste management at
over 250 previous events, ranging in size from less than 1,000 attendees to over 100,000 attendees.
Clean Vibes knows how to clean a site in a cost efficient, effective, and environmentally friendly manner.
We also understand how important the maintenance and cleanup of an event is to its continued
success, as well as to the relationship the event has with the local community.

At the core of the mission and work of Clean Vibes is a genuine dedication to providing substantial and
measurable results when it comes to diverting waste from the landfill. Our focus is not on merely
creating an appearance or image of a 'green? festival. Our focus is on ensuring that there is real
substance behind the waste diversion efforts of every event we work. All Clean Vibes employees are
equally passionate about minimizing the waste footprint of the events that we work, while at the same
time educating attendees about responsible waste habits.

Vibes
Clean Vibes, LLC PO Box 3265 Vallejo, CA 94590? (707)563-9232

Based on our previous work at music festivals, Clean Vibes has developed a high level of positive name
recognition and respect among the attendees of these events. The attendees associate Clean Vibes with
a commitment to environmentally responsible waste management, and a commitment to
environmental stewardship. They know that having Clean Vibes involved in an event means that the

waste will be handled in an environmentally responsible manner.

Another value that Clean Vibes brings to a festival is the 'vibe.? Attendees appreciate seeing our crew
having fun while working hard. The 'vibe? that our crew brings to an event helps to actively engage the
attendees in the clean up process significantly minimizing the grounds cleanup. In addition, the
systems that we put in place at each event help to spread awareness about diversion efforts in general,
while also increasing the efforts of attendees to take responsibility for their own waste.

In summary, Clean Vibes will make valuable contributions to the Cannabis Cup in each ofthe following
ways:

0 Extensive experience with music food/drink festivals handled waste management at over 250
events, ranging in size from 1,000 attendees to over 100,000 attendees

I Dedication and documented success in achieving high levels of waste diversion

0 Commitment to educating attendees about responsible waste management
0 Positive name recognition and respect within the festival community
0 The ?vibe' we bring to an event

0 Ensuring the event is recognized as an event that is committed to minimizing its ecological
footprint

Proposed Scope of Work

Set Up and Implementation of Waste Management Collection System

Clean Vibes proposes to implement a comprehensive waste management plan for the festival site.
Attendee participation in the maintenance and clean up of the event grounds will be a top priority for

our crew and work plan.

Clean Vibes will set up and strategically place up to 300 recycling and trash collection containers in
groups as necessary. All collection stations will be clearly marked with signage as to the appropriate
receptacle for each type of material (recycling or landfill). We will routinely patrol the festival site and
empty containers as necessary, as well as cleanup trouble spots. Clean Vibes will thoroughly clean the
site of the previous day's waste in time for the opening of the venue on Sunday. After the event, Clean
Vibes will thoroughly clean the site in as timely a manner as possible. Staff members will hand pick the
site, bag loose litter, and collect all bags of waste for proper disposal.

Clean Vibes, LLC PO Box 3265 Vallejo, CA 94590* (707)563-9232

Clean Vibes will provide a small crew on 9/7, full crew on 9/8-9/11, and an final sweeps small crew on
9/12.

Increasing Awareness and Marketing of Sustainability Efforts
if desired, Clean Vibes management will work with High Times to:
0 Develop appropriate advance messaging strategies to attendees about responsible waste

management using the festival website, mailing lists, press releases, etc.

- Provide input on any possible ?greening? related components of the event in order to develop a
comprehensive and coordinated sustainability initiative

- Work with the festival team to help create onsite messaging and creative ways of educating
attendees about their waste footprint

0 Help communicate to all festival staff and vendors about appropriate disposal of waste and how
they can work as a team to minimize the overall waste footprint of the event

Cost for Clean Vibes? Services

Below is a breakdown of costs for Clean Vibes? services for the Cannabis Cup Detroit in 2017. It is our
hope that, when the various bids for this event are evaluated, more than just the bottom line cost of
services will be taken into consideration. We hope that the substance and quality of each bidder?s
waste diversion efforts will be seen as a source of added value and that the various bidders? track
records on this source of value will also be taken into account. There are certainly Other companies that
are able to setup the appropriate collection containers and clean the festival site. However, Clean Vibes
is the only company that has the skills and experience to achieve high levels of waste diversion through
recycling. We have a proven track record of achieving unparalleled diversion rates and the ability to
provide clients with documented results. If High Times is committed to taking its sustainability efforts
to the next level by diverting a substantial amount of festival waste from the landfill while ensuring a
thorough and timely cleanup of the site, choosing to work with Clean Vibes will prove to be a
investment.

RE: Giffels Webster - Request to outright vacate with easement alternative of Marcus Ave, Rugg St

Giffels Webster, 28 W. Adams, Suite 1200, Detroit, Michigan 48226 on behalf of Crown Enterprises; inc.
respectfully 

The requested right-of-way vacations with easement alternative is located within the block bounded by
Georgia St, MT Elliot Ave, Huber Ave. and Belt Line. Approximate limits of the vacation can be found in
Exhibit A Alternate Easement, enclosed herein.

Giffels Webster has been asked to facilitate the requested vacations. We will be working with the City of
Detroit's Department of Public Works Civil Engineering Division, and all stakeholders to achieve vacations
that are satisfactory to all interested parties.

The requested vacations with easement alternative will neither impede pedestrian and vehicular traffic, nor
will it interfere with the maintenance of the public rights-of?way, including utility company and Fire and Police
Department access.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Tricia DeMArco by phone, at
313.962.4442, or by email, at TDemarco@qiffelswebstercom.

including construction, demolition, permitting, inspection, survey, etc.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies informed of this

Honorable City Council:

 

RE: Petition No. 590 First Latin American Baptist Church, request to vacate and
convert to easement the alley adjacent to their property located at 2004 Scotten Ave.

Petition No. 590 First Latin American Baptist Church request to vacate and convert to easement
part of the north-south alley, 20 feet wide, in the block of Vernor Highway, 66 feet wide, Wolff
Avenue, 50 feet wide, Scotten Avenue, 66 feet wide, and Palms Avenue, 50 feet wide.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility review)
and report. This is our report.

The request is being made to facilitate a future development.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, and Traf?c Engineering Division
DPW, and City Engineering - DPW.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the conversion to easement.
The specific DWSD provisions for easements are included in the resolution. DTE Energy reports
involvement because they have services in the area; a specific provision to maintain access to DTE
facilities is a part of the resolution.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies have reported no
objections to the conversion of the public right-of-way into a private easement for public utilities.
Provisions protecting utility installations are part of the attached resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

BY COUNCIL MEMBER RAQUEL CASTANEDA-LOPEZ:

WHEREAS, In 2017, the Detroit City Council adopted a ?Resolution Declaring the Second
Monday in October Indigenous People?s Day in Detroit?, to Show respect to the original and
continuing inhabitants of the region. The City of Detroit acknowledges the need to heal by
honoring Detroit?s Anishinaabe community and the federally recognized tribes of Michigan, as
well as all Indigenous people who come from across the Americas to live and work within the
City?s limits; and

WHEREAS, The State of Michigan is home to 12 federally recognized Anishinabek
governments. (See, ?Tribal Governments?) The self-descriptive name,
?Anishinaabe?, references the large group of culturally related Indigenous peoples (who identify

parts of the United States, including Michigan. In Ontario, the Anishinabek Nation is a political
advocate for forty member First Nations across the province, tracing its roots to the Confederacy
of Three Fires and

WHEREAS, The land on which Detroit sits, is within the traditional territory of the Confederacy
of Three Fires, comprised of the Ojibwe (Chippewa), Odawa (Ottawa), and Bodewadmi
(Potawatomi) Nations, and was home to many ancient nations, as evidenced by burial mounds
and artifacts located along the Detroit River; and

WHEREAS, The land on which Detroit sits was not discovered, rather it has been occupied by
Indigenous peoples long before Western written documented history; and

WHEREAS, The common language of the Anishinaabe community is Anishinaabemowin,
which has its own place name for the land the city rests on Waawiyatanong (Waa-wiya-ta-
nong), or ?where the water goes around?; and

WHEREAS, To this day, much of Detroit?s existing roadway infrastructure is founded on
Indigenous trail systems, created to travel and congregate here. NOW THEREFORE, BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council on behalf of the people of Detroit, recognize and
honor the City of Detroit as Waawiyatanong ?where the water goes
around?, on Indigenous People?s Day, the second Monday in October, in this year, 2019, and
every year henceforth on the second Monday in October; and BE IT FURTHER

RESOLVED, The Detroit City Council encourages research be conducted on trail marking

designations so that appropriate street names may be identi?ed, and signage supplemented, to
re?ect both the modern and historical names of geographical places throughout the City.

RESOLUTION TO DECLARE MARCH 18, 2020 HOT DAY IN

HONOR OF THEIR CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY

On September 17, 2019, the Honorable Council President Brenda Jones requested that the

Legislative Policy Division draft a resolution to declare March 18, 2020 Hot Sam?s Day in

Detroit to honor their upcoming centennial anniversary.

The draft resolution is attached for your review.

BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES

RESOLUTION TO DECLARE MARCH 18, 2020 HOT DAY IN HONOR OF THEIR
UPCOMING CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative functions; and

WHEREAS, Hot Sam?s is the quintessential Detroit business, a Detroit men?s fashion brand
built on loyalty to the city of Detroit for nearly 100 years; and

WHEREAS, In 1921 Sam Freedman founded Hot Sam?s and opened the store on 1317 Brush
Street in the heart of downtown Detroit; and

WHEREAS, Hot Sam?s quality and low prices brought people into the store and earned a
reputation that attracted The Temptations, The Miracles, The Four Tops, Joe Louis and former
mayors Coleman A. Young and Kwame Kilpatrick to regularly shop there; and

WHEREAS, In 1974, Tony Stovall began to work at Hot Sam?s. Mr. Stovall held the positions
of assistant manager, manager and top salesman. Cliff G. Green began with the company in 1983
after working six years as a buyer for J.L. Hudson?s; and

WHEREAS, Twenty years later, in 1994, the two men joined forces and bought the store. The
purchase of Hot Sam?s made them owners of the largest African-American men?s fashion store
in the region, and they have continued to deliver high quality men?s merchandise at great values;
and

WHEREAS, City Council recognizes the additional challenges minority businesses owners
endure and honors Hot Sam?s for their grit, vision, determination and commitment to their
customers and to the city of Detroit; and THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council, in honor of their upcoming centennial anniversary,
hereby declares March 18 as HOT Day in the city of Detroit; and

NOW THEREFORE BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be
forwarded to the of?ces of the City Clerk and the Mayor.
