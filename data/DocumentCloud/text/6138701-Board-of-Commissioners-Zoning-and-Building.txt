PROPOSED REZONINGS

RE: Proposed rezonings pursuant to adopted Cook County Comprehensive Land Use Plan
The only remaining component of the Board's commitment and adoption of the new
Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance is consideration of 13 proposed
rezoning in seven townships.
Please review the attached list of sites listing the township, general location of the site, zoning
under our prior ordinance and the proposed zoning pursuant to the adopted Land Use Plan
and Zoning Ordinance. You will also note the ZBA position, which is their initial opinion, and
"Comments," which is a perfunctory reason for the change.
In order to complete this remaining item, I believe the following should occur:

Items 1, 2
These sites are subject to annexation, either pending or completed. No action is necessary
except to receive and file the information in committee.
Items 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
These sites are mobile home parks. The adopted ordinance classifies these types of
residential areas to be in R-6, R-7, or R-8 zones, subject to special-use requirements. They
are not a permitted use in any zone. (Under the prior ordinance, mobile home parks were
allowed as special uses in R-7, C-6, and C-8 zoning districts, resulting in these residences
often being placed near business or factory use areas.)
These sites should be referred to the Zoning Board of Appeals to conduct hearings in the
respective townships to consider and review their zoning in light of the adopted ordinance.

Items 5, 6, 8
The new zoning ordinance provides a new "public" classification for public or open land uses.
Item 5 is a county maintenance facility. Items 6 and 8 are the result of public hearings
regarding the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and are the result of municipal requests.
Items 5, 6, and 8 should be referred to the Zoning Board of Appeals for hearings to consider
changes in zoning pursuant to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
