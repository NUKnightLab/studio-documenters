COMMISSIONERS
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
ITEM #1
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON CONSTRUCTION #299984
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
submitted is the proposed Cook County Green Construction Ordinance that would require all Cook
County contractors working on public construction contracts, budgeted at $2 million or more, to use
cleaner diesel fuel and pollution controls on their vehicles and equipment. I will introduce this ordinance
at the April 15 Board meeting and refer it to the Construction Committee.
Diesel pollution is known to cause lung cancer, asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, and premature
death. Our efforts to help clean up diesel pollution will improve the County’s air quality, protect the
health of the residents of Cook County, and, ultimately, reduce the burden of health care on our public
health system.
The Green Construction Ordinance will have a modest impact on construction costs. For most green
construction projects, the total costs of using cleaner fuels and pollution controls has cost less than 1% of
the total project cost.
Air pollution continues to be a serious problem in Cook County. This ordinance will help the County
meet federal air quality standards, which the County continues to violate.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY GREEN CONSTRUCTION ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 30 Environment, Article
IX Green Construction, Sections 30-950 through 30-955 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as
follows:
ARTICLE IX. GREEN CONSTRUCTION
Sec. 30-950.

Board of Commissioners findings.

(a)
Diesel exhaust particle pollution poses a clear and present health risk to the people of
Cook County. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified diesel exhaust as a
likely human carcinogen, and has identified diesel particulate matter and diesel exhaust organic gases as
toxic air pollutants. Diesel exhaust is also a prime contributor to airborne fine particle pollution that is
linked to premature death and other serious cardiovascular and pulmonary problems such as heart attacks,
abnormal heart rhythms, atherosclerosis, stroke, asthma attacks, permanent respiratory damage and
retardation of lung growth in children.

(b)
pollution.

Cook County is a US EPA designated non-attainment area for fine particulate matter

ITEM #1 cont’d
(c)
The health impacts from diesel emissions particularly affect children, the elderly, and
people with weakened immune systems.
(d)
Particularly high concentrations of diesel emissions often occur in heavily traveled
transportation corridors, intermodal yards, bus depots, and construction sites; these diesel “hot spots”
often are found in densely populated, urban areas, disproportionately impacting ethnic minorities and
people of lower economic status.
(e)
Diesel engine crankcases also are a source of emissions that can seep into the cabin and
expose vehicle drivers and passengers to harmful diesel emissions.
(f)

Diesel exhaust also contains black carbon emissions, which contribute to global climate

(g)
problems.

Reduction of diesel emissions can help address these human health and environmental

change.

(h)
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has enacted requirements over the
past few years requiring the substantial reduction of emissions from new diesel engines in both heavyduty highway vehicles and land-based non-road equipment. However, these regulations do not apply to
any of the over 11 million existing diesel engines in the United States, most of which emit substantially
more pollution and often remain in service for 10 to 30 years, depending on the type of engine and
equipment.
(i)
Practical, cost-effective measures to substantially reduce diesel particulate emissions are
available today, and can be applied to many existing diesel engines. The same technology that limits
diesel pollution from new diesel engines can be retrofitted onto existing engines or applied in new
replacement engines to reduce diesel emissions by 85% or better.
(j)
Therefore, the purpose of this ordinance is to minimize the public health risks from
exposure to diesel particulate emissions as expeditiously as practicable.
Sec. 30-951.

RESOLUTION
ITEM #2
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
submitted is a proposed Resolution urging President Obama, the Illinois Congressional Delegation, and
the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to make changes in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)
Program that would expand the pool of qualified DBE firms eligible for federal stimulus monies. I will
introduce this resolution at the April 15 Board meeting for approval.
Following is a summary of the requested changes in the DBE program:
Raise the personal net worth (PNW) limitation from $750,000 to $2 million
PNW dates back to 1989 with SBA and 1999 with U.S. DOT;
PNW has NEVER been increased;
PNW limit does not account for differences in cost of living between large urban areas
and smaller rural areas;
Artificially low PNW makes it harder to get bonding and limits access to lines of credit
for DBE firms; and
Brings PNW in line with Cook County’s Minority and Women Business Enterprise
(M/WBE) in Construction Ordinance.
Eliminate the United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) size cap ($20.41 million)
and follow the SBA size standards ($33.5 million)
U.S. DOT size cap has only been raised twice in 10 years;
Artificially low size cap makes it harder to get bonding and limits access to lines of credit
for DBE firms;
U.S. DOT size cap does not account for differences in construction costs between large
urban areas and smaller rural areas; and
Brings size cap in line with Cook County’s M/WBE Ordinance.
Adopt the model disparity study methodology of the Transportation Research Board of the
National Academy of Sciences
Provides clear guidelines for recipients of federal transportation money on conducting
disparity studies; and
Reduces the cost of conducting a disparity study.

ITEM #2 cont’d
WHEREAS, these improvements will enable recipients of federal stimulus monies to be prepared with a
strong pool of qualified DBE firms to perform the work that is being funded; and
WHEREAS, since 1989, the DBE program has imposed a $750,000 personal net worth limitation on any
qualifying owners seeking DBE certification; and
WHEREAS, this $750,000 personal net worth limitation has never been increased; and
WHEREAS, the present DBE program in 49 C.F.R § 26.65 imposes the U.S. Small Business
Administration’s (SBA) size standards on the gross revenues of any firm seeking DBE certification but
also imposes an absolute size cap, currently $20.41 million, even if the SBA size standard is higher; and
WHEREAS, bonding capacity and ability to secure lines of credit are directly tied to both a DBE owner’s
personal net worth as well as the DBE firm’s gross revenues; and
WHEREAS, these artificially low limits on personal net worth and gross revenues are particularly
challenging for DBE firms in Cook County, Illinois due to a higher cost of living and higher construction
costs; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook and the City of Chicago, Illinois have established personal net worth
limitations of $2 million for their Minority and Women Business Enterprise (M/WBE) programs; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook and the City of Chicago, Illinois have established gross revenue caps
consistent with SBA gross revenue size standards for construction firms and do not impose any additional
size cap; and
WHEREAS, the current SBA size standard for construction is $33.5 million; and
WHEREAS, recipients of federal transportation money must have a DBE program and must develop
statistical and anecdotal evidence to show the extent of discrimination against women and minorities in
the construction industry; and
WHEREAS, the DBE program presently provides no guidelines for the methodology that should be used
for these disparity studies; and
WHEREAS, the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences is in the process of
developing a model disparity study methodology; and
WHEREAS, such a model disparity study methodology would greatly benefit recipients of federal
transportation money by providing clear guidelines for these disparity studies.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and Members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, do hereby urge President Barack Obama, the Illinois Congressional delegation,
and the United States Department of Transportation Secretary to take immediate action to increase the
personal net worth limitation in the DBE program to $2 million; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we, the President and Members of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, do hereby urge President Barack Obama, the Illinois Congressional delegation, and the
United States Department of Transportation Secretary to take immediate action to remove the size cap on
DBE gross receipts and follow the SBA size standards; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we, the President and Members of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, do hereby urge President Barack Obama, the Illinois Congressional delegation, and the
United States Department of Transportation Secretary to take immediate action to adopt the
Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences’ model disparity study
methodology; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be sent to President Barack
Obama, the Illinois Congressional delegation, and the United States Department of Transportation
Secretary.

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
ITEM #8
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH & HOSPITALS #299986
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 30, 2009 from
STEPHEN A. MARTIN, JR., Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Operating Officer, Department of Public Health
the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) respectfully requests the Board of
Commissioners approve the proposed amendment to the Cook County Board of Health Ordinance.
This proposed amendment serves two purposes. First, it clarifies the authority of the Cook County
Department of Public Health to require certain types of state-licensed providers within the
department's jurisdiction to participate in the electronic submission of syndromic surveillance data. This
data is extremely useful to the efforts of the Department in communicable disease control and has the
potential to alert us to an outbreak in its very early stages, when intervention may be most effective.
Many health providers currently participate in this program on a voluntary basis and we would like to
pursue participation arrangements with more providers to improve our efforts in this very exciting
program.
The second purpose of the proposed amendment is to memorialize authorizations, many of which have
been extended to the Department by the Board through Board Resolutions in the past regarding various
types of routine memoranda of agreement the Department periodically needs to enter into. These
agreements are typically programmatic in nature and do not involve the establishment of fees, except to
the extent that fees have been separately approved by the Board and set forth in the schedule found at
Chapter 32 Fees of the Cook County Code.
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by
TODD H. STROGER, President, JERRY BUTLER and ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN,

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDMENT TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County serves as the Board of Health and as such
over sees the regulatory and programmatic activities of the Cook County Department of Public Health;
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) engages in syndromic surveillance
activities, whereby it receives electronic transmissions of information regarding chief complaints reported
to emergency departments of area hospitals, particularly those located within suburban Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the syndromic surveillance program is an important public health tool with the potential to
assist in identifying measures that may reduce the severity of an outbreak of communicable disease; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health wishes to assure provider participation in
this program through clarification of its authority to require emergency departments and other providers,
such as urgent care centers, to participate in the syndromic surveillance program; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health participates in a large number of community
initiatives, emergency planning, and routine inspection programs which are often memorialized in
memoranda of agreement and the Board has previously, through its proceedings including various
resolutions, extended authorization to the Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Department of
Public Health to enter into such agreements; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health seeks to consolidate and clarify its
authorization to enter into various programmatic agreements consistent with Board authorization or
direction, in the Board of Health Ordinance.

on February 3, 2004 and a first amendment to lease for additional space used as a public health dental
center at 64 West 162nd Street, South Holland, Illinois, on February 15, 2005.
CCDPH has communicated to this office that due to the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board’s
election to no longer participate in the under-funded Illinois Department of Human Services case
management grant program, the public health service center at 52 West 162nd Street, South Holland,
Illinois, financially supported by this program will be closed as of March 31, 2009.
Clients who had received these services at this location have already been transitioned to nongovernmental providers in the Southland area. Also, CCDPH staff at this location have already been
relocated to other CCDPH sites. However, clients that desire to access other CCDPH services can visit
locations in the surrounding communities of Harvey, Robbins, Ford Heights, and Markham as well as
other Cook County Health & Hospitals System locations.
The second amendment provides for certain changes to the Original Lease for the purpose of returning a
portion of the Premises to the Landlord. CCDPH will continue to use the remaining premises as a public
