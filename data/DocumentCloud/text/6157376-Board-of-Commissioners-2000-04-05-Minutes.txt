COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL
CONTRACTS

Transmitting a Communication, dated March 21, 2000 from
LACY L. THOMAS, Chief Operating Officer, Cook County Hospital
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Deloitte Consulting, to
assist the Hospital in requesting a nominal charge status, for the fiscal year ending November 30, 1994,
for the Medicare Program.
Title 42, Chapter 42, Part 413.13 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires Medicare reimbursement
for medical and other services rendered by public hospitals be subject to the lower cost or charge (LCC)
limitation unless services are provided free of charge or at a nominal charge. During fiscal year ending
November 30, 1994, Cook County Hospital was not considered a nominal charge provider and as a result
Medicare reimbursement for medical and other services was subject to the LCC limitation.
Once nominal charge status is obtained a provider is no longer subject to the LCC limitation. Cook County
Hospital has attempted to gain nominal charge status in the past and our efforts have been unsuccessful.
Based on Deloitte Consulting's in-depth knowledge of the regulations governing nominal charge status,
experience in preparing nominal charge requests, and their experience with the financial transactions of
the Hospital, they are recommended for the engagement.
If Cook County Hospital is awarded nominal charge status, the Hospital may generate an additional $7

million in revenue on the Medicare Cost Report for fiscal year 1994.

1245

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 5, 2000
The proposed fee for preparing and submitting the nominal charge request for fiscal year 1994 is
$950,000.00. This fee is subject to overall satisfaction by Cook County with services performed by
Deloitte Consulting. If Cook County Hospital receives nominal charge status, Deloitte Consulting will
prepare nominal charge requests for fiscal years ending November 30, 1995 through November 30, 1998
at no additional charge.
It is anticipated that the Medicare Fiscal Intermediary will require six to twelve months to review the
request and render a decision.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $950,000.00. Revenue generating: $7,000,000.00. Contract period: April 15,
2000 through April 14, 2002. (897-260 Account). Requisition No. 08970638.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved that the County Purchasing
Agent be authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

* * * * *
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 21, 2000 from
LACY L. THOMAS, Chief Operating Officer, Cook County Hospital
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with UNISON-MAXIMUS,
Inc., Chicago, Illinois, to review and update the chargemaster which will allow the Hospital to maximize

from each one. Based on the proposals, the Hospital recommends UNISON-MAXIMUS, Inc. for the
following reasons:
a)
b)
c)

Familiarity with Hospital current charge structure
Staff availability to timely begin and complete engagement
Project approach and methodology is comprehensive and clearly defined

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $199,655.00. Contract period: April 15, 2000 through April 14, 2001. (897260 Account). Requisition No. 08970639.

of proposed amendments to the Human Resources Ordinance, which currently serves as the
blueprint for the Bureau's duties and responsibilities. Several amendments are "form" in
nature, adding a section heading numbering system and subsections. There are also minor
text amendments inserting words or reordering sentence structures for grammatical purposes.
The primary substantive amendments provide for transition to the Human Resources "Career
Service" system from "Civil Service"; distinguish Career Service from other Human
Resources functions, such as benefits administration, salary administration, etc.; clarify the
application of prior handbooks, rules, guides, etc., which, over the years, have been used by
employees and recognized by courts as applicable unless repealed; and clarify the application
of by-laws, state licensing board and accrediting organizations to selection and discipline of
physicians and dentists.

The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:

Commissioner Lechowicz thanked Mark Kilgallon for his work on the amendments to the Human
Resources Ordinance and for providing the summary sheet. He asked that the summary sheet be included
in the record and that Mr. Kilgallon explain the points of the amendments and how they would affect
county employees.
Commissioner Moran asked Mr. Kilgallon if veteran's preference is included in the amendments?
Mr. Kilgallon responded that the ordinance amendments currently do not include veteran's preference,
however, the Bureau of Human Resources is conducting a survey of various counties to determine how
veteran's preference is defined. He also stated the survey has not been completed but plans include
giving veteran's preference in County employment, which will be submitted to the Board of
Commissioners for approval.

1283

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 5, 2000
Commissioner Moran asked how long will the process take?
Mr. Kilgallon responded that the process should be completed in approximately 30 days. He indicated
that the language requires further evaluation.
Commissioner Moran informed the Committee that he had previously submitted amendments for
veteran's preference to the Bureau of Human Resources.
Mr. Kilgallon responded that the Bureau did review the Commissioner's amendments and determined that
the state statutes in his amendments do not apply to Cook County.
Commissioner Moran requested that his amendment be looked at specifically as it relates to Section 4 of
the Ordinance.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's earlier request, Mr. Kilgallon stated the Human Resources
Ordinance was passed in 1992 and did not incorporate the Shakman Consent Decree provisions nor were
they implemented throughout the Bureau of Human Resources. The changes on recruitment and how
individuals are hired were not incorporated in the original ordinance and are included in the amendments.
He continued by stating that some of the rules and guidelines have never been repealed, going back as far
as the Health and Hospitals Governing Commission; and the new ordinance will repeal those guidelines,
making one standard procedure throughout the county.
Commissioner Lechowicz stated the importance of bringing the Human Resources Ordinance in
compliance with existing federal laws.
Commissioner Hansen asked for a memorandum from the administration on the question of veteran's
preference. He stated there should be careful examination of this question.
Commissioner Moreno asked the number of veterans in Cook County and how many took advantage of
the veteran's preference opportunity in Cook County.
Mr. Kilgallon stated that he would research the question and respond in writing.

Commissioner Lechowicz moved approval of Item No. 234496, seconded by Commissioner Sims.
The motion carried.
Commissioner Moran voted nay.

Commissioner Hansen asked when the mechanical, plumbing and electrical work was last done?
Ii

Michael LaMont stated that some mechanical improvements have been done over the years but nothing
within the past five years.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont to give a brief history on the County building.
Michael LaMont stated that in the early 1990s the main switch gear from Edison was replaced in the
basement. The distribution from that switch gear up to the eleventh floor was not replaced and is
included in this project.
Michael LaMont asked representatives from Environmental Systems Design, Inc. to further respond to the
question.
Stan Czajkowski, Mechanical Engineer with Environmental Systems Design, Project Manager, stated that
the HV AC was upgraded once and is currently out-of-date. He indicated other concerns involve loads
that have been incurred by the building with upgrades, computers and occupancy.
Mr. Czajkowski gave the committee on overview of what ESD, Inc. looked at during the survey and what
they are anticipating being part of the project. He stated they are going through the complete air handling
system on the floors, that currently has individual air handlers. The company will also look at air
filtration and controls. The plan is to have a complete automated electronic system that is programmable
and can be monitored on a remote basis. He further stated that a variable air volume system will be
installed, which will be retro fitted into the existing space. Mr. Czajkowski said the project will include
additional controls on the radiation for the heating, enhance and upgrade the toilet exhaust systems in the
duct work, upgrading the basement and sub-basements for use by the County, upgrading and renovating
the cooling tower used in conjunction with the chiller, and will put variable frequency drives on all of fan
systems which will reduce operating costs by reducing the amount of electrical power needed.
Commissioner Hansen asked what will be done in the second and third sub-basements?
Mr.Czajkowski stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy asked that the second and third subbasements be enhanced so they can be used for other services. He also stated that the new systems will be
for general ventilation and the third sub-basement will not function as occupied space.
Commissioner Hansen requested that Mr. LaMont prepare a special memorandum on air quality and
ventilation. He stated that the commissioners need to know exactly what is necessary and should not
short-cut this project.
Michael LaMont responded that he will prepare a memorandum to the committee.
Commissioner Hansen raised the issue of the use of the Cook County Building in various segments. He
also asked how can this project be done when a final decision has not been made on the full use of the
County Building?
Michael LaMont responded that he does not believe there will be any waste, and when the project begins,
it will be assumed that the entire building will be occupied.

1343

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 5, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked if the building is altered in the future, can individual vent zones be
programmed at that time?
Michael LaMont responded yes.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on March 23, 2000.

Commissioner Silvestri asked if this is part of a recommendation that came from the consultant or the
administration of the facility?

Association and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. Primarily, he stated, that the project takes into
account the upgrading of the security system, lighting, and creation of a special needs unit which were all
recommendations made by John Howard Association last fall.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how much of a decrease in maintenance expenses would result from the
project and by how much?
Michael LaMont stated that he did not know at this time, but will provide something to the
commissioners.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the estimated project cost?

Chairman Carr stated that Commissioner Collins would like to respond to Commissioner Hansen's
question.
Commissioner Collins informed the committee that she and two other commissioners visited the facility
earlier in the week and observed the intake process. She further stated that plans are to have a state-ofthe-art intake process that will be moved to the second floor. The commissioner concluded by stating that
she believes the daily census is 480 and the intake area is currently not sufficient.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the project cost is $775,500 or if it was part of a larger project?
Michael LaMont stated that the $775,500 is the consulting fee for the $8.5 million dollar project.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that he appreciated the comments from Commissioner Collins because it is
informative. He further stated that because the amount of funds requested to complete the project,
someone from the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center should be present to help explain the project.
Commissioner Hansen commented that he would like to have representatives from the Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center respond at some future point, to specific questions regarding the project.

FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY (SKOKIE PARKING STRUCTURE)
Michael LaMont asked Bruce Washington to give the committee an update on the temporary parking
situation at the Skokie garage.
Bruce Washington, Deputy Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, stated that the Office of
Capital Planning and Policy would like to have temporary parking in place by May 15, 2000, have the
garage itself closed down by May 15th or some indication that the garage is safe for parking. He stated
that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has come up with two options: lease a half acre of land just
east of the existing parking structure, from the owner of Construction Technology Laboratories, Inc.
(CTL) and convert into temporary parking for the facility. If that space becomes available, roughly nine
hundred cars will be able to park in the area, which is adjacent to the existing garage. At that point, the
Office of Capital Planning and Policy would move to demolish the garage and build a new one. Option
two would be to provide temporary parking around the building itself. The plan would be to pour a gravel
stone base for approximately three hundred cars to park around the building. However, once the new
facility is constructed, the graveled area would be landscaped.

1346

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 5, 2000
Bruce Washington further stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy is trying to minimize
destroying any of the area around the building itself. He stated that the three hundred spaces is still not
enough for the parking needs of the facility. He said the other option would be to take half of the land
that is available at Construction Technology Laboratories, Inc. (CTL) for the other six hundred.
Commissioner Sims asked if there is any other vacant property close to the Skokie courthouse where a
garage can be built?
Bruce Washington responded that there is no other available land. He stated that the Office of Capital
Planning and Policy had an aerial survey of the area and the only other land close by is Forest Preserve
land which still does not meet the needs. He stated the amount of money the Office of Capital Planning
and Policy plans to spend is not a large sum but the cost to repair the existing garage is cost prohibitive
which is the reason the Office is recommending the temporary parking solution.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the total number of parking spaces at the existing garage?
Bruce Washington responded eleven hundred.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the estimated daily use?
Bruce Washington responded approximately nine hundred.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has spoken to Construction
Technology Laboratories, Inc. (CTL)?
Bruce Washington stated that they are currently m negotiations with Construction Technology
Laboratories, Inc. (CTL).
Commissioner Hansen asked if the County has any options other than demolishing the current garage and
starting over?
Michael LaMont stated that the only other option is to spend several million dollars to repair the structure
for an unknown period of time.
Commissioner Hansen asked the capacity of the new parking garage?
Bruce Washington responded that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy would prepare an analysis
and report to the committee with the findings.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the committee had asked whether the County had any options left from
a legal point of view, but has not received an answer from the State's Attorney.
Bruce Washington stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has talked to Pat Shymanski who
is still working on the matter.
Commissioner Sutker asked the length of time required for the lease to go into effect and remain in
effect?
Michael LaMont stated the County would want at least a two-year lease to design and construct a new
facility. He stated that nothing has been proposed to Construction Technology Laboratory, Inc. (CTL) in
reference to the land and they are in the initial stages.

1347

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 5, 2000
Commissioner Sutker asked if there has been any consideration given to utilizing the Forest Preserve
District parking to the west and providing shuttling between that site and the courthouse?
Michael LaMont stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has talked about it internally and
will also pursue that option.
Michael LaMont stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy will put a traffic consultant at the
courthouse to study the traffic pattern.

Commissioner Hansen moved to receive and file the Status Report on the Skokie Courthouse,
seconded by Commissioner Sims. The motion carried unanimously.
PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT- MARCH 28, 2000
Commissioner Hansen raised a question regarding the installation of uninterrupted power source (UPS) at
69 West Washington?
Michael LaMont stated that the installation is for the purpose of following the progress of that project.
Commissioner Hansen asked why is the old Cook County Hospital being included in the countywide
ADA?
Michael LaMont stated that Cook County Hospital is not being included, and ADA requirements will be
looked at in all buildings remaining after the new Cook County Hospital is built.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont if he would address his question at a later point and time.
Commissioner Hansen raised a question regarding the countywide structured wiring. He said he has not
received answers to previous questions.
Bruce Washington responded that he has been trying to find a time so that he can meet with the
commissioner and will call his office and schedule an appointment.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthe County had a contract with Lucent Technologies?
Michael LaMont stated that the Board approved a contract with Lucent Technologies recently and Lucent
provides telephone switches and upgrades, not wiring.
Commissioner Hansen asked when will the committee receive an evaluation on the Medical Records
Renovation?
Michael LaMont stated that the question is still being evaluated.

WHEREAS, Cristo Rey Jesuit High School is the first new Catholic high school in the Archdiocese of
Chicago in 33 years, and is a college preparatory school founded in 1996 by the Chicago province of the
Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) to serve the predominantly Latino community in Pilsen/Little Village; and
WHEREAS, Francis Cardinal George, O.M.I. officially dedicated the new school building at 1852 West
22nd Place in Chicago, on Sunday, March 26, 2000. The new three-story, 52,000 square foot state of the
art facility, which opened for classes in January, cost $9. 7 million and is home to 23 classrooms,
including two art studios, three science laboratories, and four computer rooms; and
WHEREAS, tuition costs at Cristo Rey are met by working at 70 different jobs in 61 different downtown
Chicago firms. Students share full time jobs at these firms and each works five days per month. Class
and work schedules are organized so students never have to miss one or the other; and
WHEREAS, Cristo Rey Jesuit High School, offers a dual language program in which students study in
both Spanish and English. This program strengthens students' skills in both languages and gives
immigrant Latino young people a greater appreciation for their native heritage; and
WHEREAS, the school enjoys a 97% daily attendance rate, less than one percent of its students have
dropped out of school, and 75% of the members of the first two graduating classes are currently enrolled
in college. In addition, Cristo Rey has received broad support from the greater Chicago community as
evidenced by a 30-month capital campaign that has netted $13.2 million and an expanding pool of
employers who seek to participate in the school's work-study program. The cost per student at Cristo
Rey is $9,000. Students earn $6,250 through their work-study positions and pay $2,200 towards tuition.
Contributions from donors make up the difference. About one-third of Cristo Rey's students receive
financial assistance through scholarships.
