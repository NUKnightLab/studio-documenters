JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, ANTHONY J. PERAICA, EDWIN REYES,
TIMOTHY O. SCHNEIDER, PETER N. SILVESTRI, DEBORAH SIMS, ROBERT B. STEELE
AND LARRY SUFFREDIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, the Honorable Carl R. Hansen, who served as Cook County Commissioner for District 15,
representing the Northwest suburbs for more than 32 years on the County Board, passed away on
Tuesday, February 2, 2010, at the age of 83; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen, the son of Danish immigrants, grew up in Chicago’s Humboldt Park
neighborhood during the Great Depression; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen graduated from Lane Tech High School and enlisted in the U.S.
Army in 1944, where he rose to the rank of 2nd lieutenant and was an officer of the United States High
Commission for Germany under then-General Dwight D. Eisenhower; and
WHEREAS, while overseas in the post-war period, Commissioner Hansen met his wife Christl in
Germany and was for the first and only time in his life rendered speechless for an entire hour, as he was
immediately smitten with her beauty, intelligence and grace; they married in Chicago in 1952; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen attended the University of Chicago’s graduate school where he
earned an MBA in 1954; he had a successful career in market research and started his own marketing,
management, and real estate consulting services firm in 1967; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen’s long career on the Cook County Board began in 1970 when, at the
age of 43, he was appointed to fill a ten-month vacancy created when a suburban representative died; he
subsequently ran and won election to the seat in 1974, and remained in office until 2006; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen’s appointment and subsequent election to the Cook County Board
was not his first venture into politics, as he served as Elk Grove Township Republican Committeeman
from 1962 to 2002, and was the campaign manager for the primary gubernatorial bid of Charles H. Percy
in 1962; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen’s sense of duty and responsibility to the taxpayers of Cook County
was widely known, and while he was a strong and vociferous advocate for the Northwest suburban area,
all of Cook County benefited from his diligence and relentless commitment to and knowledge of many
issues, including those relating to pollution, water supply, flooding, waste disposal, public health, and
preservation of green space; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen did not shrink from debate even if he was the sole voice in
opposition; he had the ability to persuade one to his side of a debate with his thunderous ferocity or
conversely, through mellifluous, impassioned speeches on the floor; and

3

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2, 2010
WHEREAS, one such issue in which Commissioner Hansen’s tenacity and determination greatly
impacted the residents of Cook County was in the blocking of the creation of a landfill at the Poplar
Creek Forest Preserves, which would have ruined six hundred acres of Forest Preserve land; this two-year
battle proved to be one of his proudest victories; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Hansen’s extensive knowledge of history was evident, and he was a great
conversationalist on topics involving different ethnicities and cultures; his knowledge of and involvement
in his own Scandinavian community was not his only ethnic and cultural interest, rather, he enjoyed a
wide variety of multi-cultural relationships and attended events celebrating ethnic diversity, and was the
proud sponsor of the relationship formed in 2005 between the County of Cook and the Province of
Palermo in Sicily, Italy; and
WHEREAS, upon Commissioner Hansen’s retirement, many were amazed to find that he had kept every
County Board and Committee meeting document going back to 1970 in perfect order, complete with his
notes and backup material; this archive was donated, along with his other papers and correspondence
files, so that others could educate themselves and understand the intricacies of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, although Cook County was an important part of his life, there was nothing comparable in
importance to Commissioner Hansen than love and devotion to his family, which included his beloved
wife, Christl, who passed in 2007, son Lothar Ulrich and daughter-in-law Gudrun, cherished
granddaughter Christina, sisters Rita Scoon (deceased) and Marilyn Jackson, and sisters-in-law Iris
Draper and Uschi Choate; his commitment to family was unwavering, and his tenderness towards his wife
was palpable and inspirational to all those who have loved.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby honor the
memory of Commissioner Carl R. Hansen, celebrate his extraordinary life, and hereby express the
gratitude of the residents of Cook County for his many years of distinguished service; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be presented to the family of
Commissioner Carl R. Hansen, as a token of our great esteem and acknowledgement of his rich legacy of
service and commitment to Cook County.
Approved and adopted this 2nd day of March 2010.

Cook County Board of Commissioners
Attest: DAVID ORR, County Clerk

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CALLING UPON THE GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO GRANT AUTHORIZATION TO
THE HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM BOARD TO LEVY TAXES FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII,
Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and
perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government has the responsibility for providing health care to the
indigent that no other County in the State has; and
WHEREAS, the demand for quality healthcare has increased over the years in addition to the
State of Illinois closing mental health hospital along with high unemployment rates and exoffenders returning to the community puts an overwhelming burden on Cook County to
provide adequate healthcare; and
WHEREAS, the financial problems confronting Cook County and the County’s
responsibility to fund public safely makes it difficult to meet the needs of quality healthcare;
and

6

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2, 2010
WHEREAS, in an effort to ensure quality healthcare to every citizen it becomes necessary
for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board to become totally separate from the
Cook County Board of Commissioners, including financial independence; and
WHEREAS, the legislative body is the only authority that can create a taxing district to fund
the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board in order that it become financially
independent of the Cook County Board; and
WHEREAS, such taxing districts as the Chicago School Board were afforded the
opportunity to improve education, similar authority would give the Health & Hospitals
System Board a greater opportunity to become independent of Cook County thus minimizing
the politics and afford them an opportunity to bring in revenue for the sole purpose of
providing healthcare in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the tax levy shall not exceed the existing amount of taxes collected by the
County Board for the purpose of healthcare; and
WHEREAS, a permanent Health & Hospitals System Board with its own consistent revenue
source would be in the best interest of the citizens of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners call upon the Governor and members of the General Assembly to grant
authority to the Health & Hospitals System Board to levy taxes for the sole purpose of
providing healthcare in Cook County.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2, 2010
AND PASS THE STATEWIDE MICROLOAN PROGRAM, HB 5420
WHEREAS, our cities, counties, states and nation continue their struggle to emerge from the economic
downturn that has settled over our country; and
WHEREAS, that struggle centers on the retention of existing businesses, the creation of new businesses
and the well-paying jobs they represent; and
WHEREAS, the most critical element to supporting existing businesses and creating new businesses is
the availability of business credit and development capital; and
WHEREAS, institutional business and development lending remains largely unavailable; and
WHEREAS, Illinois State Representative Deborah Mell has introduced House Bill 5420 which
establishes a Statewide Microloan Program and Fund; and
WHEREAS, no such Microloan Program and Fund currently exists in the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the Statewide Microloan Program and Fund will provide small loans to businesses and
entrepreneurs for the purpose of business stabilization, expansion and creation; and
WHEREAS, the Statewide Microloan Program and Fund is a state program which will be used to
provide funds for retention, expansion and development resources for entities and entrepreneurs that do
not have access to the necessary capital; and
WHEREAS, the Statewide Microloan Program and Fund will utilize “quasi-government” agencies, such
as, but not limited to: Business and Industrial Councils, Development Councils, Economic Development
Commissions, and Chambers of Commerce, as screening and administrative facilities; and
WHEREAS, just one year of the Statewide Microloan Program and Fund will afford “quasi-government”
agencies the one-year experience necessary to access federal funds from the Federal Small Business
Administration (SBA) Microloan Program for future years; and
WHEREAS, access to the SBA Microloan Program will provide the mechanisms to secure SBA business
assistance and development resources and federal funds unattainable by county and local governments
without this program; and
WHEREAS, the SBA Microloan Program’s business capital resources will substantially expand our

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2, 2010

Your Audit Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, February 9, 2010 at the hour of 1:30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chairman Daley called the meeting to order, and entered into the record a copy of a letter from his office
to the Clerk of the Circuit Court (Attachment A), and a copy of a letter to Cook County Auditor Laura
Burman, from Kurt F. Schmid, Executive Director of Chicago High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area
(Attachment B).
Jaye Morgan Williams, Chief Financial Officer, stated there were numerous improvements in operating
activities during Fiscal Year 2008, resulting in a net reduction in the number of control deficiencies,
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses identified by the auditors.
For example, in 2007 there were seventeen control deficiencies, nine significant deficiencies, and four
material weaknesses. For 2008, those figures dropped to thirteen, six, and three, respectively. The audit
took twelve months to complete, more than twice the length of time recommended by auditing standards.
This was due to transitioning activities and staff changes.
Furthermore, the added workload caused by the State’s Attorney’s investigation (concluded), contributed
to the delay.
The Bureau of Finance is planning a more aggressive audit timeframe this year and fully expects the 2009
audit to be completed by the end of June.
Tracey Guidry, Audit Director, Deloitte & Touche, presented the Committee with an overview of the
2008 audit process (Attachment C), including the scope of work, members of the team, and summary of
recommendations. Ms. Guidry also discussed various changes to the audit process required by the
Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
Ms. Guidry referenced a memo dated November 25, 2009, from the Chief Financial Officer (Attachment
D). This memo concluded that no evidence of inappropriate business practices was found during a recent
investigation of the County’s finances. Ms. Guidry affirmed that this memo satisfied Deloitt’s
requirement for third party assurance.
Chairman Daley stated his concern that all departments and agencies in county government must
cooperate fully, in a timely manner, with any request for information from any member of the audit team.
He directed Ms. Guidry to inform the Committee if any lack of cooperation becomes apparent in the
future.
Your Committee commenced consideration of the audits and report:

Commissioner Peraica inquired about mandates imposed by GASB 45, in regard to post-employment
benefits. Specifically, what is the cost estimate of the County’s total obligation?
Constance Kravitz, Cook County Comptroller, said the amount is estimated at $1.45 billion.
Commissioner Peraica inquired about allocation of costs pertaining to self-insurance, building operations
charges.
Tracey Guidry confirmed that such costs are not allocated in that manner under current practices, which is
an acceptable policy. However, allocating them is an alternative and could be implemented if the Board of
Commissioners so directs.
Jaye Williams said she would consider this alternative during the course of the fiscal year.
Commissioner Gainer said that determining cost allocations can be a lengthy process, and she suggested
that Ms. Williams begin with more basic elements of it to make it easier to initiate the process.

returned for non-sufficient funds.
Wasiu Fashina, Chief Financial Officer, Clerk of the Circuit Court’s Office, stated that it is less than one

inconvenience to many users of the court system.

Chairman Daley inquired about internal controls regarding the food inventory at the Juvenile Temporary

Earl Dunlap, Transitional Administrator, Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, stated there was a
problem with theft of supplies in the past. This goes back to 2002, prior to his arrival. There is a new
system in place, with new software that will be upgraded during 2010. The inventory logs and pull sheets
for commodities have been in use and strictly enforced since August of 2009. The only individuals with
keys are three employees that are assigned to the storage room and the supervisor assigned to the shift.
The room is monitored by video camera 7 days a week and 24 hours a day. The food inventory is done
weekly by the food service director, and a written policy and procedure manual is in place to ensure
compliance. A year-end inventory was performed on January 8, 2010 for the 2009 year. This inventory
was accurate, and reconciled with the records to show the theft problem has been addressed.
Commissioner Peraica asked about inventory controls at the Department of Homeland Security and
Emergency Management.

Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice

303347

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated October 21, 2009:
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy is requesting authorization to proceed with the
redevelopment of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building for administrative
offices for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System.
On May 5, 2009 the Board of Commissioners approved a contract with Jones Lang LaSalle
Americas, Inc. (JLL) to perform preliminary analysis and planning for the adaptive reuse

84

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2, 2010
of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building. JLL analyzed the market and
financial feasibility of office, hotel, dormitory, rental housing, condominium housing,
senior housing and educational uses, and concluded that the most affordable and lowest
risk reuse option is to renovate the building for administrative office use by the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System to replace 1900 West Polk, which is scheduled for
demolition.
The estimated cost of renovation for office use is $107,700,000.00. The Office of Capital

303347

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated October 21, 2009:
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy is requesting authorization to proceed with the
redevelopment of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building for administrative
offices for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, subject to approval by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners and the City of Chicago of an agreement
committing Tax Increment Financing (TIF) to assist with a portion of the
redevelopment costs.
On May 5, 2009 the Board of Commissioners approved a contract with Jones Lang LaSalle
Americas, Inc. (JLL) to perform preliminary analysis and planning for the adaptive reuse
of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building. JLL analyzed the market and
financial feasibility of office, hotel, dormitory, rental housing, condominium housing,
senior housing and educational uses, and concluded that the most affordable and lowest
risk reuse option is to renovate the building for administrative office use by the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System to replace 1900 West Polk, which is scheduled for
demolition.
The estimated cost of renovation for office use is $107,700,000.00. The Office of Capital
Planning and Policy will seek Tax Increment Financing (TIF) funds from the City of
Chicago to assist with the costs of renovation. Due to the building's status as "threatened"

DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $63,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for the purchase of scanners reader printers and fileprint printers.
Reason:

The transfers are needed to purchase scanners reader printers and fileprint printers to replace
the current printers that are repeatedly breaking down and have outlived their useful life.

From Accounts:
529-530
529-260

Office Furniture and Equipment
Professional and Managerial Services
Total

$49,000.00
14,000.00
$63,000.00

Total

$63,000.00
$63,000.00

To Account:
529-579

1.

Computer Equipment

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On January 22, 2010, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations. At that time the balance in the account was $0, and 30
days prior to that the balance in the account was $0. The scanners reader printers were budgeted for
in FY 2010 in account 529-530, Office Furniture and Equipment. As scanners and printers are
computer equipment with a useful life of five years, the funds need to be transferred to the
appropriate account to provide for the purchase of this equipment. The fileprint printers being
replaced are repeatedly breaking down, have outlived their useful life and have recently become
obsolete. The new fileprint printers to be purchased were not budgeted for in FY 2010 as their
purchase was not anticipated at that time.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 529-530, Office Furniture and Equipment was identified as the source of transferred funds
for the purchase of the scanners reader printers as the funds for purchasing these equipment were
budgeted for in FY 2010 in this account. Account 260, Professional and Managerial Services was
identified as the source of transferred funds for the purchase of the fileprint printers as this account
has sufficient funds to meet the needed amount. No other accounts were considered.

95

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2, 2010
3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from Accounts 529-530 and 529-260.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The funds for the purchase of the scanners reader printers were budgeted in FY 2010 in account
530, Office furniture and Equipment. As the scanners reader printers should be categorized as
computer equipment, the budgeted funds need to be transferred to the computer equipment account
to provide for their purchase. As to the purchase of the fileprint printers, when account 260,
Professional and Managerial Services was budgeted for, expected and unexpected future
expenditures were considered.
_________________________

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the transfer of funds be approved.
The motion carried unanimously.

THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
ALEXIS A. HERRERA, Chief Financial Officer
requesting that the prior authorization to advertise for bids be rescinded (Board approved September 16,

in the City of Chicago's contract with Elmhurst Ford, Elmhurst, Illinois, for the purchase of twentyseven (27) Ford Fusion Hybrid vehicles for the Sheriff's Office (25), and the Department of
Environmental Control (2).
Reason:

On September 16, 2009 the Sheriff's Office received approval to advertise for bids for the
purchase of Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid vehicles. This request to rescind authorization to
advertise for bid was prompted by notification that General Motors recently decided to
cease manufacturing the Malibu Hybrid. After researching other fuel efficient options, we
have determined that the Ford Fusion Hybrid is an acceptable alternative. The City of
Chicago has awarded a contract for the purchase of the Ford Fusion Hybrid and has granted
approval for the County to participate in this contract.

THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
ALEXIS A. HERRERA, Chief Financial Officer
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $156,000.00 from and to

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2, 2010
1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent on January 21, 2010 that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations. On this date, the balance of the account was $160,000.00
Thirty days prior to this date the balance was $160,000.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account (211-260) used for transfer of funds was identified because it was previously used to
fund the obligation of psychological testing of Sheriff’s Office sworn personnel recruits. Due to the
need to fill existing vacant Correctional Officers positions and the order by the Federal Judge in the
Duran Consent Decree to hire 210 correctional officers this year, the occurrence of psychological
testing on potential recruits will increase from approximately 300 Correctional Officers to 800.
Therefore we are transferring all the funding into the Department of Corrections account to pay for
this increase of psychological testing of Correctional Officer recruits. The account (239-333) used
for transfer of funds was identified because a change in the specifications for mattresses for the
Department of Corrections led to the contract being awarded for significantly less than the previous
year’s cost, which is what had been budgeted for FY 2010.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 211-260 and 239-333.
There is nothing that will be deferred, delayed, or cancelled as a result of the reduction in account
(211-260). There is nothing that will be deferred, delayed, or cancelled as a result of the reduction
in account (239-333).

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account (211-260) does not have a surplus; the funds are being transferred in order for the contract
to be increased due to the need to fill existing vacant Correctional Officers positions and the order
by the Federal Judge in the Duran Consent Decree to hire an additional 210 Correctional Officers.
Account (239-333) has a surplus due to the mattress contract for the Department of Corrections
being awarded for significantly less than the previous year’s cost, which is what had been budgeted
for FY 2010.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the transfer of funds be

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION
AMENDMENT TO LEASE
Transmitting a Communication dated February 19, 2010 from
RAYMOND MULDOON, Director, Real Estate Management Division
respectfully requesting approval of a second amendment to lease between the County of Cook, as
Landlord, and RML Health Providers Limited Partnership, d/b/a RML Specialty Hospitalas Tenant, for
space located at 5601 South County Line Road, Hinsdale, Illinois in County Board District #17.
On July 24, 2007, pursuant to Public Act 094-1050 and Resolution of the Board of Commissioners
approved June 19, 2007, the County of Cook succeeded to the interests of the Suburban Tuberculosis
District in properties, including property at 5601 South County Line Road, Hinsdale, Illinois. This
property is leased to RML Health Providers Limited Partnership, d/b/a RML Specialty Hospital, under a
lease dated April 18, 1997 and previously amended December 20, 2001.

130

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2, 2010
The current lease term expires May 31, 2012, with two remaining five-year options to renew. The Tenant
has requested that the lease be amended to allow additional options to renew, in order to provide
flexibility in financing possible capital improvements to the facility. RML Specialty Hospital will
continue to utilize the premises for treatment of long term and complex hospital patients who are critically
and chronically ill. The medical offices located within the subject property will continue to be used by
RML Specialty Hospital staff exclusively for treatment of those patients confined to the hospital and for
no other purpose. Details are:
Landlord:

County of Cook

Tenant:

RML Health Providers Limited Partnership, dba RML Specialty Hospital

Location:

5601 South County Line Road, Hinsdale, Illinois 60521

Term:

The term will be extended for five (5) years, to expire May 31, 2017

Renewal Options:

Tenant shall have the option to renew the lease for four (4) - five (5) year renewal
periods, on the same terms and conditions.

Current Rent:

Monthly $85,802.50 / Annually $1,029,630.00

Escalation:

Base rent is increased each year by an amount equal to the increase
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), with a minimum increase of 3% and a
maximum increase of 6%, which protects the Landlord from changes in the
marketplace. For the 3rd and 4th option periods, the rent will adjust to fair market
rent. In addition to the base rent, the Tenant pays directly all costs of
maintaining and operating the facility and the grounds.

Approval is recommended.
The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System
approved this item at their meeting on February 19, 2010.
_________________________
Commissioner Gainer, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the lease agreement be approved
and that the Proper Officials be authorized to sign on behalf of Cook County. The motion carried
unanimously.

OFFICE OF THE RECORDER OF DEEDS
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication from
EUGENE "GENE" MOORE, Cook County Recorder of Deeds
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $12,400.00 from and to the
accounts listed below to make Cook County residents aware of this service that has been provided for
their benefit to ultimately help combat property fraud.

131

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 2, 2010
Reason:

The transfer of funds will enable the Cook County Recorder of Deeds office to create a new
account to advertise for Property Deeds Fraud. This transfer would allow the Recorder's
Office to make Cook County residents aware of this service that has been provided for their
benefit to ultimately help combat property fraud.

To Accounts:

1.

Advertising For a Specific Purpose
Advertising For a Specific Purpose

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On December 31, 2009, it became apparent the Recorder of Deeds office needed to add a new
account to the Special Purpose Fund to advertise the Property Deeds Fraud Hot-Line number in
local newspapers and other media sources for Cook County Residents. The Recorder's Office did
not have the Advertising for a Specific Purpose in the 2010 budget. This account did not
exist thirty days prior to that.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Accounts 570-246, 570-355 and 571-246 were identified as the source of transfer because the
Recorder's office decided that these funds were no longer required due to the digital imaging of
microfilm records. The Property Fraud unit does not require Imaging of Records. Sufficient funds
are in the Document Storage account 527-246 Imaging of Records for this purpose.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from (570-246, 570-355 and 571-246 Accounts.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The Accounts 570-246, 570-355 and 571-246 were originally budgeted in this account because
there was a need for the Imaging of Records and Photographic/Reproduction Supplies. After the
new Property Fraud unit was established it was determined that the unit did not require the need for
Imaging of Records. Sufficient funds are budgeted in the Document Storage Account 527-246,
Imaging of Records for this purpose.
