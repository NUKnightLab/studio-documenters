Background

The CHA originally entered into an IGA with the Chicago Police Department for supplemental police
services in 2000 after disbanding the CHA Police. Since that time, the CHA has continued with this
approach of providing supplemental police services through subsequent IGAs and amendments.
The IGA allows CPD to continue to provide specialized policing programs at designated CHA
properties, as assigned. These supplemental police services include:
o

Dedicated watches for Cabrini Rowhouses, Henry Horner/Westhaven, Altgeld/Murray ,
Lake Parc Place, Brooks, Oakwood Shores, Park Boulevard, Jackson Square, Wentworth
Gardens, Dearborn, Trumbull Park, and/or other CHA communities, as needed.

o

Increased police services for the selected developments, including increased foot patrols.

o

Customized policing strategy constructed by CHA, property managers, and CPD.

1

 o

Attendance at monthly community security meetings to increase visibility in the
community.

o

Monitoring and prevention of gang activities.

o

Monitoring of drug and other illegal activities and take appropriate action, as necessary.

o

Attendance at all court hearings for all arrests made by the police officers.

o

Responding to acts of domestic violence.

o

Responding to unauthorized or unlawful activities or entries into residences.

o

Providing a dedicated CPD staff member for crime data analysis, statistics and crime
reports.

o

Additional coverage for summer surge and lease enforcement actions, as needed.

CHA's current IGA was authorized by the Board in February 2017 for $8,000,000 annually, subject to
CEO approval and budget authorization.
