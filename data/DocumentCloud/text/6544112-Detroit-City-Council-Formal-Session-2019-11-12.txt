On November 5, 2019 the Honorable Council President Brenda Jones requested that the
Legislative Policy Division draft a resolution approving the unveiling and diSplay of a portrait of
former Detroit City Council President Gil Hill.

Attached, please ?nd our draft of the resolution.

Please contact us if we can be of any further assistance.

BY HONORABLE COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES

RESOLUTION APPROVING THE UNVEILING AND DISPLAY OF A PORTRAIT OF
FORMER DETROIT CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT GIL HILL

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative functions; and

WHEREAS, The City Hall Portrait Collection offers a visual history of people whose actions
and contributions made a signi?cant impact on the lives of Detroit residents; and

WHEREAS, On Tuesday, November 19, 2019 the family, friends and former colleagues of the
great statesman, decorated ranking police of?cer, esteemed movie actor and former City Council
President Gil Hill will join the current Detroit City Council as we celebrate Mr. Hill?s memory
and unveil his portrait to be placed in the Committee of the Whole Room; and

WHEREAS, Gilbert Roland Hill, affectionately known as Gil Hill, was born on November 6,
1931, in Birmingham, Alabama. Mr. Hill was the son of Mary Lee Hill, who raised him and his
sister, Toni, as a single parent. In the 19403, the family moved to Washington. DC, where he
completed his education, graduating from Cardozo High School in 1949; and

WHEREAS, In 1950 Mr. Hill joined the United States Air Force and was stationed at Selfridge
Air Force Base near Detroit. After leaving the Air Force in 1953, he returned to the Detroit area
and joined the Wayne County Sheriffs Department in 1957 and two years later, joined

the Detroit Police Department; and

WHEREAS, For decades, Mr. Hill was a widely respected police of?cer. Mr. Hill?s natural
inquisitiveness, probing mind and dogged pursuit of excellence led to his promotion to detective
in 1969, where he ?ourished in the homicide division of the Detroit Police Department. Mr. Hill
earned the reputation of being the city's top detective, resulting in his recruitment in 1980 as one
of ?ve of?ce veteran ?super cops? chosen from around the country to assist the Atlanta Police
Department in solving the murders of 11 black children and the disappearance of 4 others, in the
?Atlanta Child Murders?; and

WHEREAS, The tenacity and expertise of Mr. Hill and the other team members ultimately led
to the arrest and conviction of Wayne Williams. The Atlanta case brought Mr. Hill to national
prominence; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Hill was promoted to the rank of Inspector in charge of the Homicide Division
in 1982, and in 1989, he retired after serving 25 years from the Detroit Police Department at the
rank of Commander; and

WHEREAS, At age 53, Mr. Hill rose to worldwide fame when he appeared with actor,
comedian Eddie Murphy in the Beverly Hills Cop ?lm series as Inspector Douglas Todd; and

WHEREAS, His intelligence earned him the respect of the Detroit Police Department, and his
instinctiveness and wit led him to Hollywood. It was the public?s trust that elected him onto the
Detroit City Council in 1989. Subsequently, Mr. Hill became Council President by securing the
largest number of votes in the 1993 and 1997 elections. Mr. Hill?s popularity and success
prompted a run for Mayor in 2001 but he was defeated in the general election by Kwame
Kilpatrick; and

WHEREAS, Among his many accomplishments during his tenure he was most proud of
drafting an ordinance which allowed senior citizens to ride the city buses free and students to
travel at a reduced rate. Mr. Hill supported other important initiatives such as casino gambling in
the city, he helped broker deals for new baseball and football stadiums downtown, and led the
partnership between Council and the Administration to create the Commercial Strip
Revitalization Project; and

WHEREAS, Gil Hill dedicated his life to making Detroit a better place for all and never stopped
believing in our city. He was passionate and relentless about changing the narrative about
Detroit?s perception and reality. While Mr. Hill?s life ended on February 29, 2016, his legacy of
service and integrity is forever embedded in Detroit?s history. NOW THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council hereby approves the portrait unveiling and display
of former Detroit City Council President Gil Hill in the Detroit City Council Committee of the
Whole Room. BE IT FINALLY

RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the of?ces of the City Clerk and the
Mayor.
