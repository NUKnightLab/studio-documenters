GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Chicago Housing Authority has refined the scope of its pre-qualified developer list for
pre-qualification for development teams (PDT) to engage development partners for the
acquisition, development and management of mixed income developments and family
units with a preference for investors in Opportunity and General Areas. CHA’s primary
objective is to provide the highest quality housing units for low-income families within
diverse and healthy communities.
As part of CHA’s unit delivery strategy, the Request For Qualification (RFQ) was created
to help accomplish the Plan Forward commitment with the delivery of 25,000 units. The
unit delivery strategy plans to build on CHA’s experience working with private
development teams and owners to supply quality housing that enables low-income
families to maximize their potential for long-term economic success.
The RFQ provides a method to pre-qualify developers and creates opportunities for the
CHA to provide capital loans with per unit operating subsidy for new construction and
rehabilitation of multi-family, mixed income and mixed use projects that directly benefit
CHA residents.
The selected respondents will be issued a “Letter of Qualification” and have two years
from the date of that letter to submit proposals to the CHA. CHA may provide financial
investment or enter into long term leases for the units, subject to Board, HUD, or other
necessary approvals.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all
applicable Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD)
procurement regulations.
The Deputy Chief Development Officer concurs with the recommendation to approve
Four (4) Development Teams for subsidized Family Housing unit delivery.
The Acting CEO/President recommends the approval of four (4) Development Teams.
