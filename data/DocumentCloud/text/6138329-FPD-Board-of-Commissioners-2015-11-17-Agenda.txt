five (5) days of paid leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates bone marrow via surgical aspiration would receive

implemented at no cost to the Preserves.
The work plan will involve improving the ecological function of existing wetland and upland plant
communities through removal of invasive species, canopy thinning to increase ambient light levels,
natural revegetation of the site with diverse native species, and hydrological restoration initiatives.
Management practices proposed for implementation on the Project site are consistent with objectives for
restoring and improving wetland function through wetland and surrounding watershed restoration.
Restoration strategies on the Project site will work toward accomplishing goals for the conservation of
existing vegetative and wildlife resources, including at least thirteen state-listed threatened or endangered
plant and animal species which are documented at the site.
Situated in northwestern Cook County, Deer Grove was the first preserve acquired by the Forest Preserve
District, beginning with 500 acres in 1916. The Natural and Cultural Resources Master Plan determined
Deer Grove West to be among the top five priorities for restoration in the District.
The project referenced in this board item advances the goals of the Next Century Conservation Plan.
