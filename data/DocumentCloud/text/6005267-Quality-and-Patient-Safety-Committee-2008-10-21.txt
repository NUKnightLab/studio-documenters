Review and__gccept mi?ttes of the meeting of the Quality and Patient Safe? Committee of
September 23, 2008

 

Director Butler, seconded by Director Mn?oz, moved to accept the minutes of the meeting of the Quality 
and Patient Safety Committee of September 23, 2008. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 

Receive quarterly quality report from Ambulato? Communityl Hea_lth Network of Cook Countyr

Chairman Ansell re nested that members of the Committee receive reports for their review one week in advance
for future meetings . He also requested that by the next meeting that a standard ?dashboard" of quality
indicators be presented to the Board, agreed upon by all the quality directors and 

Angela Schrimpl, Director of Accreditation and Quality; Dr. Enrique Martinez; and Dr. Leon Fogelf'eld
presented the quarterly quality report for the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County.

During the presentation, the problem of limitations with regard to gathering data was discussed; Chairman
Ansell stated that it would be bene?cial to have representatives from Information Services at future meetingsS.

Both Dr. Ansell and Dr. Munoz commented on the data presented that showed signi?cant delays for
colonoscopy, women?s gynecology and other important services. Dr. Munoz stated as the patients are
predominately minority, these delays were unacceptable. Both also commented on the fact that screening
mammograms were not being provided in the system. Dr. Ansell stated that part of the purpose of this
Committee was to report service or other quality issues to the whole Board so that the Board can make
budgetary decisions. It would be Dr. Ansell?s priority to ensure that basic preventive care and core diagnostic
and treatment services are available to patients in the health system. He also expressed that insofar that some of
these services might also be available within the private community health center community, that relationships
with these community health centers should be pursued. He urged the Committee members to develop a priority
list of services that absolutely had to be provided in the System for presentation to the Board.

Dr. Ansell inquired about the make up of the ACHN Quality Committee and suggested that the membership be
expanded to include medical and other line staff, such as Dr. Fogelfeld.

Director Munoz, seconded by Director Butler, moved to accept the quarterly quality report from
Ambulatory Community Health Network of Cook County. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

 

Receive reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees from Provident Hospital of Cook
Coung, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and John H. Strogerl Jr. Hospital of Cook County

As Dr. Mark Krause, President of the Medical Staff at Provident Hospital of Cook County, was unable to attend
the meeting, Dr. Aaron Hamb, Chief Medical Of?cer of Provident HoSpital of Cook County, presented a verbal
report on his behalf. He indicated that there have been procurement issues between the System and the
County's Purchasing Department; some contracts and procurement items approved in August by the System
Board are not yet processed by the County?s Purchasing Department.

Chairman Ansell requested that Dr. Hamb outline this issue in a letter'so that resolution on the matter can be
reached".

Dr. Homer Abiad, President of the Medical Staff at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, presented the August
28, 2008 and September 25, 2008 reports of the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County Medical Executive
Committee.

 

Receive update on meeting of Hospital Quality Assurance Directors

Lula Roberson, Interim Director of Quality Services at Provident Hospital of Cook County, provided an update
on the meeting of the Quality Assurance Directors. She stated that they met with Dr. Jack Raba, Interim Chief
Medical Of?cer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System; as a result of this meeting, several
recommendations were made.

Director Ansell suggested that these recommendations be presented to the Committee at a future meeting for
their consideration . . -

Director Ansell requested that in the future, presentations or updates should also be in written form?.

 

?Never Events? and IHA Policy on Payment for Serious Adverse Even?ts

 

.Chairman Ansell explained that ?never events" could be de?ned as those events that should never occur in a
hospital; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has decided as of October that they are no
longer going to pay for them.

Therefore, every institution has to have a policy which includes a methodology for not charging for these types
of events. Chairman Ansell stated that he would distribute a copy of the policy from his institution for reviewI.
He stated that the issue was complicated; medical leadership and many departments need to be included in the
discussion and implementation of such policy. He would like to see the Chief Medical Of?cers and Dr. Raba
initially work on this; additionally, he hoped that a draft policy could be presented to the Committee at either the
November or December meeting .

During the discussion, Dr. Linda Rae Murray, Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County Department of Public
Health, was asked to provide an update on the Family Case Management program transition at the Committee?s
November meeting.
