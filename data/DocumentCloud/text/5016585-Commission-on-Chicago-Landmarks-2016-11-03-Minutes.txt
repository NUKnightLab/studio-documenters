1. Approval of the Minutes of Previous Meeting
Regular Meeting of October 6, 2016
Motioned by Wong, seconded by Rossi. Approved unanimously (7-0).

 2. Demolition of a Structure Pursuant to §2-120-740 through §2-120-825 of the Municipal
Code
PILGRIM BAPTIST CHURCH
3301 South Indiana Avenue

WARD 3

Dijana Cuvalo presented the staff’s recommendation that the Commission: (A) Pursuant to
Section 2-120-780 of the Landmarks Ordinance, preliminarily find that the demolition of the
remaining walls of the building will adversely affect and destroy remaining significant
historical and architectural features of the property. Even though the 2006 fire resulted in the
loss of portions of the building, what remains still has substantial historic and architectural
value and sufficient integrity to convey the characteristics that make the significance of the
building recognized and understood. The general mass, fenestration pattern, location/siting,
and detail of the historic remaining walls convey Sullivan’s mastery of scale and proportion
that he achieved during his masonry period; and, (B) Preliminarily find that the demolition
of the remaining walls of the building is a per se adverse effect on the significant historical
and architectural features, pursuant to Article III, Section G.3.b., of the Rules and
Regulations; and, (C) Issue a preliminary decision disapproving the demolition application.
Staff further recommended that the Commission advise the owner to repair the existing
masonry walls as necessary and relocate the exterior bracing (currently blocking the public
sidewalk) to the inside of the walls to comply with the Department of Building’s citations on
the property.
Ms. Cuvalo informed the Commission that a preliminary decision disapproving the
demolition application would trigger an informal conference and, if the informal conference
does not reach an accord, a public hearing on the permit application would be scheduled in
accordance with the provisions of the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance.
The owners’ attorney asked that the Commission approve the demolition application.
Vote to approve staff recommendation.
Motioned by Houlihan, seconded by Tolliver. Approved unanimously (7-0).
3. Class L Property Tax Incentive – Final Certification
POLISH NATIONAL ALLIANCE BUILDING
1514-1520 West Division Street

WARD 2

Cynthia Roubik presented the report. Vote to approve the resolution that the project has been
substantially completed in accordance with the approved ordinance and meets the eligibility
requirements for the Class L incentive for the Polish National Alliance Building.
Motioned by Dziekiewicz, seconded by Houlihan. Approved unanimously (7-0).

 4. Demolition of a Building Pursuant to §2-120-740 through §2-120-825 of the Municipal
Code
WICKER PARK DISTRICT
1328 North Wicker Park Avenue

WARD 1

Larry Shure presented the staff’s recommendation that the Commission: (A) Find that,
pursuant to Article III, Section G.1. of the Rules and Regulations of the Commission on
Chicago Landmarks (the "Rules and Regulations"), that the significant historical or
architectural features of the district are all exterior elevations and rooflines; and, (B)
Preliminarily find that the subject building, a 2-story masonry rowhouse constructed prior to
1886, contributes to the character of the Wicker Park District, which includes excellent
examples of the architectural styles that were popular in Chicago in the period from the
1870s through the 1920s; and, (C) Preliminarily find that the demolition of a contributing
building or structure within a landmark district is a per se adverse effect on the significant
historical and architectural features, pursuant to Article III, Section G.3.b., of the Rules and
Regulations; and, (D) Pursuant to Section 2-120-780 of the Landmarks Ordinance,
preliminarily find that the demolition of the subject property will adversely affect and destroy
significant historical and architectural features of the property and the district; and, (E) Issue
a preliminary decision disapproving the demolition application.
Mr. Shure informed the Commission that a preliminary decision disapproving the demolition
application would trigger an informal conference and, if the informal conference does not
reach an accord, a public hearing on the permit application would be scheduled in accordance
with the provisions of the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance.
The owners’ attorney asked that the Commission approve the demolition application.
Vote to approve staff recommendation.
Motioned by Houlihan, seconded by Wong. Approved unanimously (7-0).

meeting was held at 121 N. LaSalle St., in Room 201-A.
Present:

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 216-232 N. Peoria/905 W. Fulton Market
27th Ward
Fulton-Randolph Market District
Proposed demolition of the 1-story buildings at 230 and 232 N. Peoria, partial
demolition with rehabilitation of the front façade for the 3-story building at 226 N.
Peoria, rehabilitation of the 3-story building at 216 N. Peoria with a new 2-story
rooftop addition, and construction of a new 5-story building for commercial use.
Action:

The Permit Review Committee found 2-0 the following (with
Commissioner Houlihan voting “present”):
Proposed Demolition and Partial Demolition:
1. Preliminarily find that the property at 232 N. Peoria/901 W. Fulton, a
1-story commercial building, is non-contributing to the character of the
Fulton-Randolph Market District and its demolition will not be an
adverse effect on the character of the Landmark District;
2. Preliminarily find that the property at 230 N. Peoria, a 1-story
commercial building constructed in c.2000, is non-contributing to the
character of the Fulton-Randolph Market District and its demolition
will not be an adverse effect on the character of the Landmark District;
3. Preliminarily find that the proposed partial demolition of the building
at 224-226 N. Peoria, with the rehabilitation of the front façade to be
retained in-place, will not be an adverse effect on the character of the
Landmark District;
4. Recommend that the Commission recommend to the City Council
approval of the proposed demolition of the buildings at 230-232 N.
Peoria and partial demolition of the building at 226 N. Peoria in

 accordance with Section 2-120-825 of the Municipal Code of Chicago,
entitled “Permits for demolition of landmarks – City Council Approval
Required”; and,
Proposed New Construction:
5. Find that the proposed project, contingent upon City Council approval
and with the following conditions, will not have an adverse effect on
the significant historical and architectural features of the landmark
property and district and approved the project with the following
conditions:
a) A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing the proposed
structural work, relative to how the remaining structure should be
braced and protected during demolition and construction, shall be
submitted for Historic Preservation staff review and approval, as
part of the permit plans. The recommended measures, sequencing,
and protections shall be incorporated in the structural and
architectural drawings;
b) Given that gangways between buildings are not typical of the
district development pattern of buildings built lot-line to lot-line,
the existing 4’-6”-wide gangway between 216 and 226 N. Peoria
may be infilled with a glass window wall as proposed;
c) The proposed rooftop addition, set back 23’ from the Peoria facade
and 17’-7” taller than the historic parapet is approved as proposed;
d) The proposed new 5-story construction at the corner of Fulton and
Peoria with the 5th floor setback 15’ from Fulton Market street is
approved as proposed;
e) Enlarged canopy, window, and storefront details shall be included
in the permit plans. Simulated divided-lite muntins shall have a
substantial interior and exterior profile with spacer bar;
f) Masonry cleaning shall use the gentlest means possible. Masonry
repair and replacement details and cleaning SDS sheet shall be
provided as part of the permit application; and,
g) Exterior wall samples to be submitted for review and approval to
Historic Preservation staff prior to order and installation.
2. 942 W. Fulton Market
27th Ward
Fulton-Randolph Market District
Proposed rehabilitation of existing three-story building and construction of a new,
one-story, rooftop addition.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1) The one-story rooftop addition, proposed to be set back 15’ from the
Fulton Market façade, is approved as shown on plans dated August 5,
2016;
2) The new cornice with a projecting profile and support brackets is
approved as proposed;
3) Window and storefront details, including existing and proposed
profiles for any storefront features, shall be provided with the permit

 application;
4) Any replacement stone shall match historic stone in color, size, finish,
and profile. Masonry repair and replacement details shall be included
in the permit plans; and
5) Samples of all proposed exterior cladding shall be submitted to
Historic Preservation staff for review and approval prior to order and
installation.
3. 6900 S. Bennett
5th Ward
Jackson Park Highlands District
Proposed replacement of existing clay tile roofing with DECRA stone-coated metal
roofing tile.
Action:

Approved 2-1 (with Commissioner Dziekiewicz voting against) with the
following condition:
1) As proposed, the historic green glazed Ludowici Italian clay roofing
tiles of the house may be replaced with dark green DECRA stonecoated metal shingles approximating the profile and appearance of the
historic clay tiles;

4. 742 S. Dearborn
4th Ward
Printing House Row District
Proposed new 7-story building with 60 residential units with ground floor retail and
residential roof deck.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1) Permit plans shall include:
a. Enlarged dimensioned sections of the rooftop enclosure and deck;
b. Enlarged dimensioned details and product specifications of the
proposed architectural louver/grille system, which shall have a low
profile and a dark, factory-applied finish;
c. Enlarged dimensioned elevations and sections of the proposed
storefronts, which shall have a dark, factory-applied finish;
d. Enlarged elevations and sections of the proposed cornices, which
shall have a substantial projection; and,
2) The standard-size face brick (Interstate Brick Iron), mortar (deep
brown) and cast stone sample (resembling Indiana Limestone), dark
bronze window cladding, black granite for the bulkhead panel and
gray Nichia Panel Cladding for the penthouse enclosure is approved as
submitted.

5. 777 S. Dearborn
4th Ward
Printing House Row District
Proposed new 4-story masonry building with ground-floor commercial space and one
residential unit for the upper floors.

 Action:

Approved unanimously with the following condition:
1. The proposed shape of the 4-story building is unusual compared to the
general shapes associated with the district and the proposed dark
grey/black cladding material is also not consistent with the district’s
color palette. In combination these two issues result in a new structure
that does not meet the Commission’s guideline and criteria for new
construction. Changing the color of the cladding material to be
consistent with the earth-tone color palette of the historic buildings in
the district, such as in a red or brown color range, would substantially
alleviate this issue. Should material samples of the exterior cladding,
consistent with the above described color palette, be submitted to
Historic Preservation staff for review for approval, the proposed
project shape, scale, and design is approved as submitted.

6. 439-441 W. Arlington
43rd Ward
Arlington and Roslyn District
Proposed new 4-story masonry residential building for 8 dwelling units and 14
enclosed parking spaces with relocation of an existing curb-cut.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Exterior Alterations to 439 W. Arlington:
1. As proposed, the existing 7’-7-1/2” wide curb-cut and driveway may
be relocated to the west side of the property and may be enlarged to be
12’-0” wide as this new location is at the edge of the landmark district
boundary and helps to create a buffer from the residential character
along Arlington to the commercial use along Clark;
2. The two historic masonry piers may also be relocated further west
along the property to align with the relocated curb-cut as proposed.
The face brick and stone units shall be salvaged and reinstalled to
match the existing pier designs;
3. The new 1-story portion of the new construction project may abut the
existing west side façade of 439 W. Arlington as this area is clearly
secondary and set back 28-feet from the front façade;
New Construction at 441 W. Arlington:
4. The proposed siting, size, shape, and scale of the new 4-story building
exhibits the features associated with the district and is approved as
proposed with the following conditions:
a) The 4th floor set back from the front façade per drawings dated
11/3/16 is approved as proposed. Rooftop trellises and/or
permanent landscape features are not approved at this time and
would require additional information and future review and
approval;
b) The design of the new garage door, proposed to be setback
approximately 50’ from the front façade shall have a painted finish
and incorporate recessed paneling in-keeping with the architectural

 character of the district. The garage door cut-sheet shall be
included in the permit plans;
c) All window and door details shall be included in the permit plans.
The simulated-divided-lite muntins shall have substantial exterior
and interior profiles with a spacer bar; and,
d) Exterior wall material samples shall be provided as part of the
permit application for Historic Preservation staff review and
approval.
