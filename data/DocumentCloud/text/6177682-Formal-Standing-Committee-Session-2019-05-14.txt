RE: Requesting the City of Detroit to investigate the permanent closure of a
public alley in the block bounded by Beaubien, Custer, St. Antoine and Horton.

On behalf of Paradise Valley Investment Group at 560 Custer, we respectfully request
your honorable City Council authorize the closure of public alley in the block bounded
by Beaubien, Custer, St. Antoine and Horton. Due to the fact that we control our
property on both sides of the alley and for the benefit of completion of our development
project, it is in the best interest that the alley be closed in order to facilitate the
necessary parking and customer access for the new development. In order to provide a
secure, safe area for citizens and patrons it is necessary to have the permamnet
closure. The alley is not currently in for use and is essentially overgrown and only used
to house the various utilities. We do not desire to relocate any utilities nor shut off
access to the alley for the remaining residential and business interests at the Western
end. Essentially, we are requesting the closure of the Eastern end to facilitate our
development goals. Our intention is to continue access for the existing stakeholders.

RE: Giffels Webster - Request for encroachment into the public alley right-of-way.

Giffels Webster, 28 W. Adams, Suite 1200, Detroit, Michigan 48226 on behalf of Bedrock Real Estate
Services, LLC, 1092 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan, 48226 respectfully requests to encroach into
the public alley, bounded by Woodward Avenue, W. Grand River Avenue, Griswold Street, and State
Street, with the installation of a ramp with a railing and bollards.

We are requesting a 6 foot encroachment into the public alley right-of?way, which will extend from
approximately 4 feet below grade to 6 feet above grade in height to accommodate the installation of ramp,
railing, and bollards.

This encroachment will neither impede pedestrian nor vehicular traf?c, nor will it interfere with the
maintenance of the public rights-of?way, including utility company and Fire Department access. The
requested encroachment maintains a 14 foot wide access way within the alley for vehicular use. Obtaining
this encroachment is critical to fully utilize the rear of the property for deliveries of goods for the retail
establishment. Drawings of the proposed location of encroachments are attached.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Giffels Webster planner, Deirdre Clein
at (P) 313.962.4442 or dclein@qiffelswebstercom.

RE: Petition No. 1416 Rhoades McKee, request to vacate an alley bisecting a property
located south of the intersection of Gratiot Avenue and Dubois Street.

Petition No. 1416 Rhoades McKee on behalf of MDBA, LLC requesting the vacation and
conversion to easement of the north-south public alley, 20 feet wide, in the block of Hendricks
Street, 50 feet wide, Gratiot Avenue 120 feet wide, St. Aubin Avenue, variable width, and Dubois
Avenue, 50 feet wide.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility review)
and report. This is our report.

The reason for the request is for a parcel combination on both sides of the alley; and for a possible
future development.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, and Traf?c Engineering Division
- DPW, and City Engineering - DPW.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the conversion to easement.
The speci?c DWSD provisions for easements are included in the resolution.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies have reported no
objections to the conversion of the public right-of?way into a private easement for public utilities.
Provisions protecting utility installations are part of the attached resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

Re: Request for vacation of alley
Our ?le No. 101451-11

Dear members of the Detroit City Council:

This law of?ce represents MDBA, LLC a Michigan limited liability company that
has acquired property in the City of Detroit i am writing to request, on behalf of MDBA,
that the City vacate an alley that bisects this property and has never been used as a public right
of way.

The subject alley is located south of the intersection of Gratiot Avenue and Dubois Street
in the platted subdivision of the West 11?: of Private Claim No. 91. The alley is depicted in the
enclosed plat map and survey. MDBA has acquired the lots on both sides of the alley and wishes
to consolidate all of the lots and the alley into one parcel. The alley has historically been used by
MDBA's predecessors in title in conjunction with the ownership of the adjacent lots.

We would greatly appreciate your prompt attention to this request and look forward to
working with the City with regard to this matter. You may contact the undersigned with any
communications related to this request.

Very truly yoursII

Dear Ms. Winfrey:

Vanguard Community Development has been a leader in the historic North End neighborhood of Detroit
since 1994, when it was founded by Bishop Edgar Vann. As the most senior North End community
development organization, with the most capacity for development, we feel the responsibility to brand
the community and preserve its identity amidst a rapidly changing area.

Thus, we sought and have been awarded a grant from the Michigan State Housing Development
Authority (MSHDA) to fund permanent signage identifying the entrance to the North End at Woodward
Grand Blvd. The sign will occupy the median of Grand Blvd, similar to the ?New Center? sign just
across the intersection on West Grand Boulevard. Additionally, we will support this placema king effort
by hanging light pole banners along East Grand Boulevard (on the north side of the road) and Woodward
Avenue (on the east side of the road, north of Grand Blvd). The installation will occur in October 2017.

The design for the permanent sign and banners will elegantly represent the culture of the North End,
namely our architectural treasure chest of historic homes. The sign will be made of wrought iron for a
simple and classic feel, with the words "The Historic North End? front and center. The banners will say,
?Welcome to the Historic North End," and feature a silhouette of an historic home. Vanguard and our
board of community advisors feel that the North End needs to assert its identity and sense of place as
the areas around it experience a great deal of redevelopment. Signage is an important step in guiding
the neighborhood as it grows with and within Detroit.

Sincerely,

    

Pamela Martin?Turner
President and CEO
Vanguard Community Development
