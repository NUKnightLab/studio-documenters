MOTOR FUEL TAX FUND AUDIT REPORT NUMBER 38. Rupert F. Graham, Jr.,
P.E., Superintendent of Highways, transmitting a Communication, dated April 11, 2008:
submitting the Motor Fuel Tax Fund Audit Report Number 38 completed by the Illinois
Department of Transportation for the County Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006, beginning
December 1, 2004 and ending November 30, 2006. This audit covers the Cook County’s
allotments and expenditures of the Motor Fuel Tax Fund for the improvement and
maintenance of the highway infrastructure and appurtenances.
The Illinois Department of Transportation is authorized to conduct an audit of the Cook
County Motor Fuel Tax Fund by the Road, Bridge and Other Related Laws of Illinois,
under the citations of ILCS 5/5-701.0 through 701.16, ILCS 5/5-402.0, and 30 ILCS

Pappas, Cook County Treasurer, transmitting a Communication, dated May 6, 2008:
submitting herewith a copy of the Independent Auditor’s Report of the financial
statements of the Cook County Treasurer’s Office as of November 30, 2007 and 2006.
*Referred to the Audit Committee on May 20, 2008.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 294145. The motion carried unanimously.
295908

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, Dorothy Brown, transmitting a Communication,
dated August 18, 2008:
Please find the submitted Fiscal Year 2007 Independent Auditor Report, which includes
the Report of Independent Accountants on Compliance and Internal Controls for the
Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court. Please accept this report and refer it to the Cook
County Audit Committee for review.
*Referred to the Audit Committee on September 3, 2008.

Commissioner Gorman asked if the report contained any findings.
Laura Burman, Cook County Auditor, replied that one finding is detailed on page 36. The auditors
observed unreconciled differences in liability accounts. The differences are being rectified.

7617

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 15, 2008
Chairman Daley asked for a further explanation regarding management’s statement that a staff shortage is
the reason why the Clerk of the Circuit Court was not able to reconcile the discrepancies between general
ledgers and auxiliary ledgers.
Wasiu Fashina, Chief Financial Officer, Clerk of the Circuit Court, stated the 40 budgeted positions in the
Accounting & Bookkeeping Division for Fiscal Year 2008 are not all Certified Public Accountant
positions. The ledger discrepancy problem goes back many years, and has proven difficult to solve. Staff
must go to the record storage warehouse to locate old documents. They will continue working on this
problem.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 295908. The motion carried unanimously.
296222

COOK COUNTY’S HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR
FISCAL YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2007. Transmitting a Communication, dated
September 15, 2008 from Donna L. Dunnings, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of
Finance:
Subject:

Health Facilities Financial Statements for the
Fiscal Year ended November 30, 2007

submitting herewith a copy of Cook County’s Health Facilities Financial Statements for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, prepared by the Cook County Bureau of Health
Services and audited by Deloitte & Touche, LLP. Respectfully request that the report be
referred to the Cook County Board’s Audit Committee for further consideration.
*Referred to the Audit Committee on September 17, 2008.
Chairman Daley informed the Committee that this report is also before the Audit Committee of the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System Board.
Commissioner Goslin asked for an explanation about the statistics showing a decline in the number of
patients who were using Cook County health services in 2007.

7618

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 15, 2008
David R. Small, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
replied that after the Board of Commissioners approved a substantially reduced budget for the system at
that time, the resulting cutback in services caused the decline in patient census numbers. He further
observed that average length of hospital stays is declining as part of a national trend.
John R. Morales, Cook County Comptroller, discussed ongoing efforts to improve the reporting capability
of the JD Edwards financial management system. It is his belief that the software is not being utilized to
its fullest capacity in the Health and Hospitals System. To improve the program may require an
additional cost.
Commissioner Collins said she is reluctant to approve any more spending on technology-related
initiatives until cost savings from previous projects are documented.
Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 296224. The motion carried unanimously.
296225

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2007. Transmitting a Communication, dated
September 15, 2008 from Donna L. Dunnings, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of
Finance:
Subject:

Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR)
for the Fiscal Year ended November 30, 2007

submitting a copy of Cook County’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR)
for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, prepared by the Cook County Office of the
Comptroller and audited by Deloitte & Touche, LLP. Respectfully request that the report
be referred to the Cook County Board’s Audit Committee for further consideration.
*Referred to the Audit Committee on September 17, 2008.
Chairman Daley stated the Management Letter that traditionally accompanies the CAFR is not complete,
and therefore it may be appropriate to defer this matter.
Ms. Dunnings replied the Management letter will be complete by October 15, 2008.
Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to defer consideration of
Communication No. 296225. The motion carried unanimously.
296226

program.

to notice on Tuesday, October 14, 2008 at the hour of 10:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County

Your Committee has considered the following item and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendation is as follows:
296495

RESOLUTION REGARDING THE MEETING OF THE CONTRACT COMPLIANCE
COMMITTEE FOR THE STATUS OF A THE DISPARITY STUDY PRIOR TO THE
EXPIRATION OF THE INTERIM ORDINANCE (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto Maldonado, County
Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, in 2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit struck down the
County’s Minority and Women’s Business Enterprise (MBE/WBE) Ordinance as applied
to construction contracts because it was unconstitutional; and
WHEREAS, in the absence of this ordinance, minority (African American, Hispanic,
and Asian) and women owned firms each received only 1 percent of Cook County
construction contracts compared to 44 percent prior to the ruling; and
WHEREAS, in 2006, the Board of Commissioners implemented an “Interim MBE/WBE
Construction Contract Program Ordinance” to ensure fair representation for minority
contractors who have suffered discrimination in County construction projects; and
WHEREAS, since adoption of the Interim Ordinance, attorney Colette Holt, a nationally
renowned expert who specializes in the field of minority contract participation and who
drafted the County’s Interim Ordinance, has been working on a Disparity Study that
substantiates the need for the Interim Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the Interim Ordinance sunsets on December 31, 2008 and if the Board
intends to re-authorize it, a Disparity Study must be completed.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Contract Compliance Committee
of the Cook County Board will convene for the purpose of holding an informational
meeting to hear a presentation from Colette Holt on the status of the Disparity Study prior
to the expiration of the Interim Ordinance.
*Referred to the Committee on Contract Compliance on October 1, 2008.

Chairman Maldonado introduced Colette Holt, Attorney at Law and MBE/WBE Consultant. Ms. Holt
presented an overview of the Cook County Availability Study currently underway and stated that after the
original construction piece of the Cook County MBE/WBE Ordinance was struck down as
unconstitutional, MBE/WBE participation dropped from 40% to 4%. Citing numerous difficulties in
obtaining accurate data from the County due to its over-reliance on an outdated paper system, Ms. Holt
stated she will not be able to complete the Availability Study by the December 31, 2008 sunset date of the
Interim MBE/WBE Construction Contract Program Ordinance and requested an extension through June
30, 2009. Chairman Maldonado stated he would amend the Interim Ordinance to sunset on the requested
date.
Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved the approval of Communication
No. 296495. The motion carried unanimously.

Please accept this request to obtain the following three (3) properties.

Parcel 29-04-108-019-0000 is a vacant industrial building. Parcel 29-04-108-023-0000 is
a commercial building that is occupied by a business operating as C & R Excavating.
Parcel 29-04-108-028-0000 is a vacant commercial building. The Village has submitted
Affidavits of Abandonment with respect to both vacant properties.
The Village intends to use each of these three buildings for industrial and commercial
development. They are not part of our 138th Street Corridor Plan; however, they are
adjacent to the southern border of the Plan area and have similar characteristics as those
properties in the Plan area. The Village intends to develop the properties in the same
spirit as the 138th Street Corridor Plan in order to expand tax revenues. Currently, there
is no third-party-applicant for any of the parcels.
The Village agrees to report the status of each parcel to the Cook County Department of
Economic Development annually for five consecutive years or until the intended use is
complete, whichever is last. Also, the Village will apply for tax exempt status on each
parcel once a tax deed is obtained until a developer is designated.
The Village has retained the Law Offices of Kenneth W. Pilota and shall bear all costs to
proceed to tax deed and perform all legal and other activities associated with this
program.
*Referred to the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee on 09/03/08.
Ken Pilota, Esq., Law Offices of Ken Pilota, stated that, with regard to these three parcels, the Village of
Riverdale has not yet identified a third party, but would like to acquire these parcels and prepare them for
future commercial and industrial redevelopment.
Ms. Malito stated that it is very difficult at present to determine the occupancy of these parcels. She stated
that she did see some trucks which look new at the location; the village stated in its package that an
excavating company is occupying the property.
Janice Morrissy, Director, Community/Economic Development, Village of Riverdale, stated that the
property is occupied by an excavating company; there may be materials dumped on site, possibly
environmental hazards, and the property shows sign of deterioration. The last time she checked they did
not have a business license. It is her understanding that the owner died.

7629

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 15, 2008
Chairman Sims stated that it needs to be determined whether the property is occupied. If someone owns
it, it is Cook County’s policy that they are afforded the opportunity to pay back taxes.
Randolph Johnston, Assistant State’s Attorney, stated that there may be a lease or rental agreement
between a business that may be there and the owner. He advised that it would be the safest course to
defer this item until it is determined whether this is a leasing situation.
Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved the approval of Communication
No. 295884. The motion carried unanimously.
Chairman Sims entered into the record a letter from Elizabeth Reidy, Assistant State’s Attorney,
Deputy Bureau Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, dated 10-1508, and a letter from Janice L. Morrissy, Director, Community and Economic Development, Village
of Riverdale, dated 10/15/08. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Butler moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Vice Chairman Goslin. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
