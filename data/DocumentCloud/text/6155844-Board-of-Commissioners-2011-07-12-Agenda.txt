CONTRACT ADDENDUM
ITEM #8
APPROVED AS AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 22, 2011 from
TARIQ MALHANCE, Chief Financial Officer
and
GREG WASS, Chief Information Officer
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract and to execute a contract with
Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), Chicago, Illinois, to assist Cook County with
expediting the delivery of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
system, and system integration services. GFOA will also assist Cook County with the evaluation of key
business processes, the evaluation of the users, devices, and applications that currently interface with the
JD Edwards system, and with the development of an ERP System Integration RFP.
The analysis process will allow the County to accurately determine what business processes could be
improved prior to the new system, and to define the functions that should be enabled by the new system.
It will also allow County personnel to objectively evaluate proposal responses, references,
demonstrations, the qualifications of assigned vendor personnel, and project costs.
Reason:

After careful analysis, Cook County determined that it was in its best interest to expand the
scope of the ERP project to benefit all agencies, including those under the Office of the
President; the constitutionally elected offices; the Health & Hospitals System; and the Forest
Preserve District.
The expanded project scope increases the level of ‘due-diligence’ that is necessary to
accurately define the RFP Requirements, etc.. The benefits of the extended-effort accrue to
Cook County, resulting in essential information that is needed to integrate back-office
operations across the enterprise, and making it possible to determine the priority that should
be given to business process changes. They also make it possible for all qualified ERP
software firms and system integration firms to propose a Countywide solution.
GFOA subject matter expertise is needed to expedite the delivery of component work
products which enhance the ERP System Integration RFP and improve the vendor selection
process. No other firm provides the depth of knowledge in government ERP best practices,
the breadth of experience on large government ERP projects, the number of government ERP
references, or the ability to provide equivalent capabilities for less cost to Cook County.
A non-profit organization, GFOA has no affiliation with any software or hardware vendors,
and serves as a completely independent agent for its government clients. Their involvement
allows Cook County to demonstrate a commitment to projects that exhibit value, and a RFP
process that is transparent from beginning-to-end.
The growing number of problems related to the JD Edwards system heightens the need to
make the ERP Systems Integration RFP an immediate priority, and the Cook County ERP
Center of Excellence requests authorization to begin working with GFOA on the expected
July 12, 2011 Board approval date.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: not to exceed $569,240.00. (715-009-266 Account). Contract Period: July 15,
2011 through July 14, 2012.

with a County option to renew for two years thereafter.
Reason:

Request for Proposals (RFPs) were issued on March 28, 2011 resulting in the submission of

The County currently uses an average of 272,000,000 kWh annual with a total estimated
annual cost of $23.5 million which includes the commodity, transmission, distribution,
capacity, ancillary, and administrative costs.
With approval of the service agreement herein, respectfully request that the Chief
Administrative Officer, or designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of
Cook, all documents necessary to implement and administer the service agreement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $255,680.00 (FY 2012: $127,840.00; and FY 2013: $127,840.00). Contract
period: December 2011 billing dates through December 2013 billing dates. All costs will be charged
against the annual appropriation for the utility electricity funds for each using department. (499-410, 500410, 501-410, 564-410, 891-410, 893-410, 894-410, 897-410 and 898-410 Accounts).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2012 and 2013 funds.

On May 1, 2001, your Honorable Body approved an Improvement Resolution appropriating
$3,400,000.00 towards completion of this improvement. At the time of this improvement resolution,
the primary scope of the improvement was limited to concrete patching, curb and gutter repairs, and
adjustments or reconstruction of existing drainage structures. Although the project limits have been
reduced from the original resolution, additional funding is required due to expansion of the
improvement scope to include diamond grinding of the existing four-lane concrete pavement from
east of Wilmot Road to approximately 600 feet east of Pine Street, pavement reconstruction and
widening to provide six travel lanes from east of Pine Street to Deer Lake Road, combination
concrete curb and gutter, median repairs, median removal and replacement, crack and joint sealing,
sidewalks, retaining walls, bridge removal, box culvert installation, bridge repairs, enclosed drainage
system, right-of-way acquisition, traffic signal modernization and replacement and water main

Reason:

Contract Maintenance rates are substantially higher than projected. There is an increased need
for disposal of hazardous waste - scavenger services. Due to legislation for fetal burials, costs
of burial shells have unexpectedly increased. As a result of unanticipated administrative hires,
there will be an increased printing cost. Since the transcription contract did not bid when
submitted to Purchasing, funds are being spent outside of that encumbered amount. Due to
under budgeted rental equipment, there is a need to increase this budgetary line. As a result
of unforeseen costs in upgrading the office with new radiology equipment and expansions,
the FY budget needs to be increased.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
For all transfers, the account used for the source of the transferred funds was identified based on
available funds due to employees resigning and retiring during the fiscal year and fully funded
salary positions that were not immediately filled at the start of the Fiscal Year. Additionally, future
costs were taken into consideration. No other accounts were considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There will not be any delays, cancellations, etc., in the account that funds will be transferred from.

4.

If the answer tithe above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The amount in this account was originally budgeted with the anticipation of hiring into vacancies
immediately. However, without a confirmed final budget, hiring was delayed to ensure that the
positions were fully funded. Additionally, two (2) employees retired December 31st and three (3)
appointed positions became vacant unexpectedly March 29th. These appointed positions were not
posted until May 16th and 20th almost 1 month after the request to hire's were submitted. We do
not anticipate the positions being filled until July 2011 at the earliest. Therefore, this created cost
savings that are necessary to fund the above-referenced costs for the operating accounts to continue
the regular operations of the office. We are currently going through the hiring process for five (5)
vacancies (including the three appoint positions which are not posted positions).

PROPOSED CONTRACT
ITEM #30
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL #313609
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 17, 2011 from
HERMAN BREWER, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into and execute a contract with Noresco, LLC,
Des Plaines, Illinois, for a Guaranteed Energy Performance Contracting Project. Phase 1 of this contract
provides for engineering services for an investment grade energy audit of the Department of Corrections
Campus and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. Noresco, LLC was selected through a Request for
Qualifications (RFQ)/Request for Proposal (RFP) process as highly qualified and offering a competitive
price.
Reason:

This contract provides for a guaranteed energy performance contracting project at the
Department of Corrections and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center campuses. The goal
of the project is to identify and implement identifying energy conservation measures (ECMs)
that will result in at least a 10% reduction in emissions and energy costs as compared to a
Base Year, throughout a 15 year financing period. Phase 1 consists of a comprehensive
investment grade audit of 13 buildings on the Department of Corrections and Criminal Courts
Campus. If the ECMs identified are estimated to achieve cost savings sufficient to cover
financing of the ECMs, the parties will negotiate in good faith the terms of Phase 2, pursuant
to which Noresco, LLC will perform engineering and construction services to implement the
agreed upon ECMs. If adequate cost savings to cover the financing costs cannot be identified,
the County has no obligation to pay for the audit. If adequate savings are identified but the
County chooses not to enter into a GEPC or chooses not to finance the conservation measures,
the County will pay the actual cost of the audit, up to a maximum of $149,000.00.

Under this proposed extension, Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) will
implement changes to the program developed by the court in consultation with members of
the Cook County Board of Commissioners, community outreach groups, housing counseling
agencies, legal aid offices, and housing policy and advocate groups. These changes will
include establishing housing counseling workshops in neighborhoods throughout Cook
County and switching to a fee-for-service arrangement to compensate housing counseling
agencies. These modifications will enable the program to accommodate and assist more
residents facing foreclosure and ensure the highest quality control of housing counseling
services provided in the most economically efficient manner. As of May 31, 2011, there were
75,112 mortgage foreclosures pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County. A two week
extension will allow for a public hearing and performance based metrics. A one year
extension will provide the time necessary to fully evaluate the program modifications. IHDA
was originally selected to manage the program’s housing counseling services for a limited
period early in March 2010. In November 2010, a Request for Proposals (RFP) process was
completed. IHDA was the only respondent to the RFP.
