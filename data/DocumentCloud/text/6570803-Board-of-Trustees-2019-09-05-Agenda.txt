IV. Chief Executive Of?cer?s Report

CEO Dreyfuss-Wells began her report by stating that on August 22ml the District completed the
successful advance refunding ofa portion ofthe District?s debt. She introduced Ken Duplay, Chief
Financial Of?cer, to speak about the transaction.

Mr. Duplay reminded the Board that on June 20?? the District requested authorization of a
refunding transaction ofa portion ofthe 2010 Build America Bonds. Since then, Mr. Duplay said
working closely with the District?s ?nancial advisor from Baker Tilly, the District met with rating
agencies Moody?s and 88.5? on August Both agencies affirmed the District?s ratings and
pointed out including strong leadership and financial leadership and continuity of that
leadership. The District overall has a strong financial position in liquidity and other metrics. Less
favorable aspects are related to the current debt load and future debt load related to the consent
decree, but Mr. Duplay stated that given all of the factors, the District is happy with the good
results. The bonds were priced on August 22??1 in New York. When the process was started, there
was about 8% savings on about $250 million ofthe 2010 bonds. Everything moved in the District?s
favor and ended closing with 14.7% savings - $37 million net present value savings that equates

to $47.3 million gross debt service savings between now and 2040. The transaction went
exceptionally well from beginning to end and a lot of District staff from Finance and other
departments contributed to building the of?cial statement. This transaction along with the 2017
refunding which was about $18 million in net present value savings are examples of how the
District is looking to save money for the ratepayers. Also included are the $475 million of value
engineering, the savings the District has realized on awarded consent decree projects as well as
over $70 million present value of various savings initiatives on the Operations side, including
Operational Readiness related improvements and optimizations at the Renewable Energy Facility
(REF).

Mr. Brown congratulated Mr. Duplay on an outstanding outcome. Ms. Dreyfuss-Wells thanked
Mr. Duplay and District staff that helped in the effort. She also stated that on August the
District hosted Congressman Anthony Gonzalez from the 16?1 US Congressional District to tour
the Southerly plant and the Lab. Congressman Gonzalez?s district overlaps with the District for
portions of Olmsted Township, Olmsted Falls, Berea, Middleburg Heights, Parma, Parma Heights,
Strongsville and North Royalton. Legislative Affairs organized the visit. Analytical Services did
the tour of the Lab, talking about daily permit compliance and some of the issues Congressman
Gonzalez was interested in related to harmful algal blooms, phosphorus and other questions.
Southerly staff explained to the Congressman how they treat wastewater for 530,000 people and
they took him through the REF.

Ms. Dreyfuss-Wells stated the District was awarded with the prestigious 241]} Annual Achievement
in Excellence in Procurement for 2.019 from the National Procurement Institute. The award
recognizes excellence in both public and non-pro?t agencies that demonstrate a commitment to
procurement excellence. The District also received the award in 2015, 2016, and 2018.

Mr. Brown stated that when the District entered into the consent decree process and started talking
about the tools available, whether it be low interest loans or re?nancing, it had no idea where the
rates were going to go. He said at some point he would like to have a candid conversation about
all of the things that have resulted in signi?cant cost savings and where our trajectory will take the
District to the extent that the District is still engaged with the Federal and State EPAs in terms of
looking at some of the late term project delivery and doing value engineering as well so that there
is an understanding about the accomplishments to mitigate some of the costs or the impacts of
where rate structures could have been had we not used these tools effectively and ef?ciently.
