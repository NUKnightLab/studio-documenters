BOARD ACTIONS
1.
Case No. L-RC-10-027
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 31/County of Cook

Chairman Zimmerman called the case. Counsel Tansino reviewed the issues presented by the exceptions to
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Rosenbaum's Recommended Decision and Order (RDO), and
recommended that the Board accept the ALJ's recommendation. After discussion, Chairman Zimmerman
proposed accepting the ALJ's result, but finding it unnecessary to reach the "direction" issue.
Subsequently, Member Sadlowski moved to accept the ALJ's result, without reaching the direction issue,
and Chairman Zimmerman seconded the motion. Chairman Zimmerman and Member Sadlowski passed
the motion by a voice vote. Member Anderson opposed, contending that the ALJ's recommendation should
be rejected.
2.
Case No. L-RC-10-023
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 31/City of Chicago
Chairman Zimmerman called the case, noting that no party filed exceptions to ALJ Clifford's RDO, and
asked whether the Board wished to review the decision on its own motion. The Board declined to do so.
VI.

OTHER BOARD MATTERS

Executive Director Brosnan presented the fiscal report, reviewing in detail the general ledger sheet and the
disbursement record. The Chair and Members then discussed and questioned various aspects of the fiscal
report. Executive Director Brosnan addressed their concerns. Thereafter, Executive Director Brosnan

 updated the Board as to the status of legislation that could affect the agency. After a short discussion
regarding whether there was a need for executive session, the Board concluded that it was unnecessary at
this time.
VII.

ADJOURNMENT

Chairman Zimmerman called for a motion to adjourn. Member Anderson made a motion to adjourn the
meeting, and the Board passed it unanimously, by a voice vote.
Adopted and approved by the Chairman and Members of the Local Panel of the Illinois Labor
