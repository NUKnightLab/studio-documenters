IV. New Business
Department of Finance recommends using excess surcharge funds to pay down the debt on 911 bonds.
There is a surplus from earlier years of up to $15.74 million. Department of Finance recommends
redeeming the Series 2004 911 bonds maturing in 2020 to 2022, to provide approximately $2.7 million
in budgetary savings over the next 4 years. This would also lower the amount we transfer every year.
The surplus exists because the City used other funding sources to pay 911 charges in prior years.
A motion to reconvene and further discuss and vote on early payment of debt before the next regular
meeting was made by Chief Lewin.
The Motion was seconded by Commissioner Ford.
The Motion passed.
