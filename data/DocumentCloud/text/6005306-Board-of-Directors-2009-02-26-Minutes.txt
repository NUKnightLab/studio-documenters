Report of the Meeting of the Board of Directors
February 26, 2009

ATTACHMENT #1

Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Board of Directors Meeting of February 26, 2009 .

Report of the Interim Chief Executive Officer

*2009 Budget update

Final budget approved with a 2% cut and .594. increase to the turnover
adjustment line item 'All of the 2% out can be handled through adjustments to
supply, contract services, and Special line item accounts across the
System?s operating units. The increase to the turnover adjustment is meant to recognize
the delay in budget passage and the resultant delay in ?lling vacant positions. The
attached sheets (FY 2009 Target and FY 2009 recommended Reductions to Achieve 2%
Reduction) provide this information in a bit more detail.

Additionally a single line item was created to recognize an ?anticipated? increase
in FederalfState fimds, for the not impact of the new DSH funds and in
temporary economic stimulus package increases to Medicaid. This estimated will
.be transferred to the County?s ?ind account for payment of self?insurance claims. lt?

unclear at this time if the System will be allowed to retain any additional amounts beyond
the that mi ht be realized. 



Finally, our Capital Equipment request of was approved as part of the
- budget adoption; in old capital ?md accounts for System purchases (sitting in
accounts for at least 6 years and not used) has been identi?ed by the County Finance
Office and will be used to ?md a portion of our approved Capital budget. The remainder
(approximately is subject to County issuance of new bonds; teams for bond
issuance have not been. approved by the County Board at this time. Mr. Calldn, of
course, continues to work with the County Finance Of?ce on the development of a
Master Capital Lease Agreement to provide an additional, and in some instances a more
bene?cial, option to purchasing medical equipment.

3

*Economic Stimulus Activgy' and Intergovernmental Transfer Agreement

- States can now begin to draw down portions of the increased Federal monies for
Medicaid programs and the Department of Health and Family Services is working with
the Federal government on this. As expected there is much discussion in Spring?eld
about how to use Economic Stimulus monies to help with the State's budget de?cit. It
remains unclear if, how, and to what extent additional Medicaid ?rnding will trickle
down to our System, but we are in continual contact with HFS o?icials on this matter.

10

The Intergovernmental Transfer Agreement (IGA) has been drafted and discussed
with HFS. Representatives of our System and the County have begun to review and work
at this document. Once this document is agreed to and approved by both the and
County Board, the ?ow of the new DSH dollars will begin, retroactive to July 1, 2008, as
well as the recalculation of all paid Medicaid claims to re?ect the approximate 50% cut
in our per diem rates. This will be a very large administrative undertaking both for HFS
and us.

Interim System CMO Report
Meeting
2126109

Integration of System?wide Clinical Services:

Departments of Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics, Family Practice, Radiology,
Rehabilitation Medicine, and Surgery are now designated as system-wide entities.
Divisions of Adult Endocrine, Hematologlencology, Pain, PulmonarleriticaI Care,
Neurology, Ophthalmology, and Urology are now system-wide units. Cardiology, ENT,
Family and GI are in process. Searches for Stroger Department
Chairpersons of and have been completed and candidates selected;
both will be appointed as System Chairs. Searches for System Chairs of the Departments
of Anesthesiology and Laboratory/Padiology are approaching conclusion.

A meeting of existing (ED, Pulm/Critical Care, Peds, Adult Endocrine, Radiology,
Surgery, Eye, Urology, Pharmacy) and in?process system-wide clinical programs was
convened and a draft of expectations for system-wide leaders developed. -

System-wide Department Chairperson, System Division Chairs and Af?liate CMO job
descriptions have been drafted, reviewed, revised, and ?nalized.

A Table of Organization for the matrix reporting relationships between the System
System CCO, the System Department and Division Chairpersons, and the af?liate
has been drafted and recommended by the CMOs.

Collaborations within and outside System:

Pulmonaryz?Critical Care, now a system-wide program, is collaborating with Provident
and Oak Forest to address Critical Care sta?ing needs.

Laboratory services taskforce has submitted its initial recommendations and will be
developing a timeline for the consolidation of laboratory testing for the System. Prieto
Health Center will soon be sending its lab tests to Stroger as the ?rst step toward
integration of lab services. .

Pain Service is a now a System-wide Division and is assuming responsibility for the Pain
Clinic at Oak Forest Hospital.

The Malcolm - Cook County Physician Assistant (PA) Program has the highest
percentage of minority students in the USA and has been an important partner of the
clinical leaders have to the Advisory Board to assist
the program with its efforts to regain full accreditation.

An assessment of Cardiology capabilities in the System has been initiated in order to
identify opportunities for enhancement of services.

ACHN and the IT department has initiated planning to allow its FQHC
community health center partners to receive electronic access to medical information on

shared patients via Cemer.

Questions concerning new Northwestern-Stroger OB-GYN
agreement mules

(1) How many Ole-residents do we have at Stroger now? Their source
Rush. others)?

We currently have 15 Sir-agar residents. For the past 10 years we have
had 20+ until this last year. A number of residents have left the program with the
recent accreditation dlh?iculties'. We have agreed with the ACGME that our 03-
GYN program will have a maximum of no more than 16 of our own residents
starting this academic year.

We have no other residents rotating item other hospitals. We have
never had Rush residents in (or for at least 15 years). We have solicited
resident rotations from other hospitals including Rush, and Mt Sinai. Only
has showed interested in a very limited rotation for surgical experience.

(2) How many births do we do?

For the last three years, births have been trending down. in 2006, there wore
about 1000 births. in 2007, 971. in 2008, there were 903 births. A high proportion
of these are high complexity, complicated deliveries, followed by our Matemal?
tetal medicine specialists and often referred irom our perinatal nehvork. Our
prenatal clinics have been much busier but many of the pregnant women
followed here for prenatal care do not deliver here. Therefore, "nonnal deliveries?
have decreased more than complex births.

(3) What other volume measures of Die services (other than births) do we

have? .
There are multiple measures of OB-GYN services, the most important being 

latest yearly totals):
- Gynecologic surgery cases about 7'5? operations
- Outpatient yna clinic visits 9307 visits
- Family planning visits about 4000
0 Pregnancy tannin etion services about 4000 visits
. Gyne visits -- about 2500
- OB outpatient visits 6630 visits

(4) How many residents will NW add? Will the Rush residents continue
and at what number? Do we have any other resident programs with 
Will any of our staff he securing academic appointments at Do any

have them now?

The plan is initially 0.4 residents tram Northwestern rotating on Stingers
colposoopy service until July 2009. Starting 7/00, 4 FT NWresidents would 
rotate here. Many would be senior residents who would be providing general
coverage. One (FT E) of our own residents would rotate on the OB service at
North western.

46

Starting 7/10, up to 8 FTE would rotate here, depending on future plans to either
rotate more of our residents at Northwestern and/or tirrther decrease the size of
our OB-GYN program.
There are no Rush residents here in in fact, Rush has recentiy started
rotating their residents at Mt Sinai. in part, this is due to the that that
both our Shoger residents and Rush residents are in need of more 05
experience. in return, Rush offers the Mt Sinai residents some advantages over
Shoger hospitai for the gynecoiogic?aparosccpic experience that hit slnai?s
program needs. (Stroger is hiring a taparoscopic Gynecologist who Iuili expand
the avaiiability oi the technique at SH.)
We currently have two programs with Northwestem. One is in ENT, the other in
Orthopedics. We aiso have agreements with both WC and Rush in Orthopedics
and with Rush in EMT. in all of these cases, medical center residents rotate here
as we do not have our own programs in those 
One of our OB-GYN Attendings has a tong-standing academic appointment at
Northwestem dating hem when he worked at one of their a?itiates. Severei
Attendings have academic appointments at Rush. Others have appointments at
Chicago Medics! School. Most have no current medical schcoi tecuity
appointments. Se verai Attendings who be most closely in votved in
supervising North western residents witl he encouraged to obtain North western
facuity appointments (as necessary to meet AGGME requirements).
Several of the Stroger ENT facuity have Northwestern appointments. A few other
Attendings do, as wait.

How many attendings do we have in Die?

We currently have 20 faculty in ObGyn, down from 25 two years ago. There is
one vacant position that we are attempting to ?ll. We have contract services for
two Fi' physicians in Maternal- tetai medicine. One of these FTEs is ?tted by a

Rush facuity group.

B) How have all the above items trends-d over the past few years? What
do we anticipate over the next 3 years?
The deliveries here have decreased in part due to demographics and in part due
to our neighboring hospitats successfui e?orts to attract these Medicaid? eiigibte
pregnant women. Outoatiant clinic numbers have hetd steady with very recent
decreases. The wait for outpatient visits and for gyne surgery has increased
dramaticaii y. This is because of the decrease in the it ofattendings and residents
in the test 2 years. There are neariy 1000 women on the waiting itst for
gyneootogy appointments.
The trends over the next three years wilt almost certainty show in creases in
demand for gynecoiogic appointments and surgery. Man of these women are
uninsured. The hrture trends in deiiveries are hotiy debated. The number of
deilveries here may decrease more if we do not make a major effort to attract the
Me dicaid-eiigible pregnant women. On the other hand, the demand for highiy
complex perinatai care stay the same or increase as many smaiier hospitals

. are reluctant to care for these high-risk deiiveries.

47

What is the status of the accreditation Issue regarding the ?le
program?.

The ACGME recommended closure of the program a year ago. We were-able to
reverse that and we now have Fuii accreditation but with a very short review
cycle. The ACGME will return in summer of 2010. We must make more progress
in meeting the existing citations it we are to continue our program. Needy ail of
the citations have to do with inadequate numbers of procedures for our
graduating residents. The citations are in obstetrics, especieiiy Caesarian
Sections, and in certain highhr technicaliaparoscopic gynecologic procedures.
We cannot meet the required numbers of procedures through our residents?
experiences at Shager Hospitain or Provident Hospital. Nordrwestem is the best
situated to provide our residents with these experiences. it nice provides a
simulation tab and other experiences unique in the city. Mt Sinai has the
necessary volume of deliveries (it?s about 1/3 of Northwestems? but it does not
provide the experiences needed in laparoscopic'and uro?gynecoiogic surgery;
On the other hand, at Stringer; many operative and outpatient
gynecologic procedures are herein abundance. These are precisely the needs of
the Normwestem residents.

(8) Are we still paying attendings {or residents) additional

compensation to attend to births? {De attendings attend to births)?

Atten dings are no longer compensated at nights for attending to births. This was
stopped 2 years ago. However; now the overnight in?house Obstetric Attending
caii is counted toward the weekly totai of 40?50 hours per week. This has led to
dame-used numbers ofAttendings present in the clinic and the resultant.
increased waits for appointments. Attendings are expected to be present at all
births. OB-GYN residents receive no additional compensation.

The fact that other facilities are located close

to areas of highest need does not guarantee
access for patients without insurance

However, location of other facilities creates

opportunities?particularly given the cost of
creating new facilities

County contributes about 1/3 funding to help support a private-
public partnership that provides primary care. While the specifics of
the model won?t Work everywhere, partnerships have worked out.

the Gap for the Uninsured

Access to Care is a model, cost-controlling primary health care program specifically targeting low-
income, uninsured individuals living in suburban Cook County, and northwest Chicago. (North
of North Avenue AND west of Pulaski Road)

The program is a unique public/private partnership making primary health care and the ancillary
pharmacy, laboratory and radiology services available to low-income individuals. Access to Care
provides affordable diagnosis and treatment for illness to individuals and families for a small co-
payment per visit, procedure or prescription medication.

Access to Care contracts with local providers throughout Cook County and pays them a discounted
rate to provide services. Physicians volunteer to participate and choose the number of patients they
will add to their practice. They are nominally compensated.

Over 90, 000 people in suburban Cook County and northwest Chicago have been served in the 20
year history of Access to Care.

Much harder to document relative efficiency than one
would gather from the accepted consensus. There
are manyindividual items that suggest the County
hospitals and clinics are not particularly efficient.

But none provide definitive comprehensive picture
with an audit trail.

Better documentation of relative efficiency is

imperative if for no other reason than to monitor
progress.

More work is needed here.

23

 

9O

   

Operating Systems Broken

. Difficult to overstate the problems staff feel in

regard to basic systems, particularly HR and -
Purchasing

These systems work so badly, there is a deep
suspicion that they are more intended as

devices for controlling expenses than for
achieving results

24

 

91

 

Many reasons advanced for inefficiency. All
are true in degree

Blame assigning isn?t helpful; all have to be
fixed

Issue is 'such an important operational issue
it becomes strategic. But will take time and
focus to fix

Responsible stewardship of societal
resources to provide care for uninsured
requires recognition of this constraint, at
least in short term

25

 

92

 

The next step is to agree on some high level

planning guidelines. Possible guidelines
include:

- Assert Continuity Plans

- Balance demands with resources

Look for internal resources

- Special priority for Cermak and Public Health
- Strive for national benchmarks

Balance immediate needs with longer view

26

 

93

  

Board Continuity Plans

Some degree-of uncertainty in both staff and

community as to how Board views longer
term

Important to assert Board?s commitment to
continuing bey0nd current ?sunset? provision

Need to make sure planning develops visible
support for extension

Without that visibility, will be difficult to
mobilize all the resources necessary to fix
problems longer term

27

 

94

 

Widely agreed County can not meet all needs
for all patients.

The Board must decide how transparent it
wants to be about the trade-offs.

- History has been to make rationing
implicit rather than explicit

- Without adroit positioning, making
trade-offs transparent will appear to be a
service reduction and create a potential
rallying point for opponents

28

 

95

 

While there is no reason to expect additional
resources from other entities, it seems quite
possible to look for internal resources:

Better targeting of expenses
- improved revenue cycle

- May also be possible to rearrange some
resources from State

Important to spot light that the reason to be
more efficient is to provide care to more
vulnerable citizens

29

 

96

  

iffe re nt

. - 951:3 
if. .- .Lea?-gifm?aa?m

Certainly need to ensure expenditures (and
revenue) at Cermak and Public Health are
efficient

But there are fewer degrees of freedom with
regard to these areas as they are unique
County responsibilities

30

 

97

 

Need to continue developing systems to
obtain reliable benchmarking data?both
expense and quality

- Operating issues are so severe as to
constitute a strategic issue

- Need appropriate data in order to gain
and maintain publicsupport -

And once benchmark monitoring is in
place, need to follow with appropriate
ac?on

31

 

98

  

American health care will not be static going
forward.

Technology will continue to evolve

May be major social changes?what happens

if country adopts some fOrm of universal
hea?h?

Need to remember history?all the times

people said ?County won?t be necessary in


32

 

Balance Immediate with Longer View

99

  

3. Adopt Broad Strategy

'1
314:: ur- -. 
- . 

The pr0posal is to adOpt one, two or more
broad scenarios that might be acceptable.

Over next month will:
- Continue fact gathering
- Refine scenario(s)

- Consider financial implications of scenarios

At end of March will reconsider and determine
what changes to make to scenarios

In April and May will solicit public feedback,

discuss particularly with State, and refine
financial information

33

 

100

  
 

After Broad Strategy, Detailed Plan

Following period of public feedback, Board
needs to adopt broad strategic direction

At that point will need much more detailed
plan with broad staff involvement and support
of the community

'34

 

101

  

Possible Scenarios

 

Could adopt many scenarios. For sake of
discussion consider following:

- Improve operations and attempt to
maintain current locations

- Focus on re-aligning resources toward
more significant presence in south
suburbs

- FoCus on role of County in developing
relationships to provide for care of
vulnerable populations

Could obviously mix, match or take other
approaches.

Measures the productivity of labor devoted to
inpatient services as a function ofthe number
of patients. Because the provision of inpatient
services is labor intensive. labor productivity
plays an important role in inpatient costs. Of
course. in addition to the number of patients.
the intensity of services provided also affects
the requirement for labor resources. Thus. this
ratio often is adjusted for case mix differentials
by multiplying the denominator by the all-
