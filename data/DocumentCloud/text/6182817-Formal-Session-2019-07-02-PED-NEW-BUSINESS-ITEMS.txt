and/or industrial purposes; it is located within the City of Detroit, a quali?ed local
governmental unit under Act 381; the parcels which comprise the Property are included
Within the or if the parcel is not within the TRA, the parcel has been determined
to be a ?facility,? functionally obsolete or is adjacent and contiguous to one of the ?facility?
or functionally obsolete parcels and the development of the adjacent or contiguous parcel
is estimated to increase the captured taxable value of the remainder of the eligible property.
The quali?cation of each parcel is described in the table in Attachment B.

The TRA is considered a ?targeted redevelopment area? as de?ned by Act 381, Section
2(rr) because the area contains not fewer than 40 and not more than 500 contiguous
parcels of real property located in a quali?ed local governmental unit; it was designated
as a Targeted Redevelopment Area by resolution of the governing body and approved by
the Michigan Strategic Fund and its designation as a Targeted Redevelopment

Exhibit A
Mack Conner Brown?eld Project
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

blight conditions persistent throughout the TRA. It is anticipated that the designation of the
TRA, contemplated by this Plan, by the governing body will occur simultaneously with the
governing body?s approval of this Plan. The designation and approval of the TRA by MSF
is expected to occur in July 2019. Copies of the resolutions evidencing the approval of the
TRA by the governing body and the MSF will be subsequently attached to this Plan as
Attachment K. The TRA will be the ?rst Targeted Redevelopment Area designated by the
governing body and the MSF in 2019.

The parcels with addresses 11031 11081 Shoemaker, 11900 Jefferson and 11900
Freud have been determined to meet the de?nition of a ?facility? as de?ned by Part 201 of
the Natural Resources of an Environmental Protection Act (N REPA).

A Phase II BSA was completed by DLZ Michigan, Inc. (DLZ) for the property located at
11031 and 11081 Shoemaker Street in May 2019. The laboratory analytical results of the
Phase II ESA identi?ed metals, semi-volatile organic compounds and volatile organic
compounds in soil samples at concentrations exceeding Michigan Department of
Environment, Great Lakes and Energy Residential Cleanup Criteria. Therefore,
both 1 1031 and 11081 Shoemaker meet the de?nition of a ?facility? as de?ned by Part 201
of NREPA.

A Phase II BSA was completed by DLZ in May 2019 for the 13.13?acre property located
at 11900 Jefferson Street (AKA the Crown Enterprises Parcel; AKA 11880 Freud) and
11900 Freud Street. The analytical results of the Phase II ESA identi?ed concentrations of
metals, volatile organic compounds and semi- volatile organic compounds exceeding the
EGLE Residential Cleanup Criteria, therefore, the property meets the de?nition of a
?facility? as de?ned by Part 201 of NREPA

The parcel with address 12000 Jefferson Street has been determined to be Functionally
Obsolete by a level Assessor (Attachment 1). This parcel is improved with a coal power
plant previously operated by DTE Electric Company. The power plant doesn?t meet
modern ef?ciency standards and is not competitive with renewable energy facilities 
wind and solar) or natural gas facilities. For these reasons, the power plant was closed in
2008.

Five parcels 11802 Freud, 11810 Freud, 11750 Freud, 11860 Freud and 2 Canal)
qualify as eligible property (as de?ned by Section 2 of Act 381) because (1) they are
adjacent and contiguous to a parcel that quali?es as a ?facility? or ?functionally obsolete?
parcel; and (ii) eligible activities will be conducted on these parcels and the inclusion and
development of these adjacent or contiguous parcels is estimated to increase the captured
taxable value of the remainder of the Property.

C. Summary of Eligible Activities and Description ofCosts (Section 13 (ZHaMbn

The ?eligible activities? that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
?eligible activities,? as de?ned by Section 2 of Act 381, because they include department
speci?c activities, as de?ned by Section 2(1) of Act 381, (Le. due care activities, soil
remediation, dewatering and removal of underground storage tanks), property acquisition

Exhibit A
Mack Conner Brown?eld Project
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

for economic development purposes, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, and site
preparation activities as well as the preparation and implementation of the Brown?eld Plan
and Act 381 Work Plan(s).

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity, a
portion of which is intended to be paid for with the proceeds of the TIF Borrowings (as
hereinafter de?ned) which pledge tax increment revenues (as de?ned by Section 2(ss) of
Act 381) from the Property, are shown in the table attached hereto as Attachment F. The
eligible activities described in Attachment are not exhaustive. Subject to the approval of
DBRA staff in writing, additional eligible activities may be carried out at the Property,
without requiring an amendment to this Plan, so long as such eligible activities are
permitted by Act 381 and the cost of such eligible activities does not exceed the total costs
stated in Attachment F.

In. addition to the summary provided for in Attachment F, a brief description of the eligible
activities to be completed in the TRA are as follows:

The areas of the TRA referred to as the ?North Berm? and ?South Berm? together
comprise 195 parcels and approximately 35 acres of land. The berms previously
constructed on these parcels contain ?ll material from an unknown origin. The
removal of these berms, to ready the site for redevelopment, is extremely costly due
to the quantity of material and due to the fact that the berm ?ll material is
contaminated and must be disposed of at a Type II land?ll facility.

Five of the parcels in the TRA contain former industrial or residential buildings in
various states of disrepair. The buildings cannot be salvaged and will be demolished
to ready the parcels for redevelopment.

The parcels to the north and to the east of the Mack Engine Plant within the TRA
have a long history of industrial use. Environmental investigation and remediation
activities are necessary to provide for proper reuse of these parcels and protect
human health and the environment. Remediation is anticipated to consist of the
removal of underground storage tanks, remediation of contamination resulting from
possible leaking underground storage tanks and disposal of contaminated
stockpiled and subsurface soil.

Most of the parcels included in the TRA are currently owned by the City and are
tax-exempt. By completing the proposed eligible activities and transferring the
property to FCA for eventual redevelopment and reuse, these parcels will be
returned to the tax rolls and produce additional tax revenue.

Exhibit A

Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall commence
within eighteen (18) months after the date the governing body approves this Plan and be
completed within three (3) years after approval of the MSF work plan. if applicable, or
three (3) years after execution of the Reimbursement Agreement (as that term is de?ned
below). Any long-term monitoring or operation and maintenance activities or obligations
that may be required will be performed in compliance with the terms of this Plan and any
documents prepared pursuant to this Plan.

The Developer desires that DBRA use the proceeds of the TIF Borrowings to pay
directly the costs of certain eligible activities and reimburse the Developer for the costs
of certain eligible activities incurred by it as described below. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to repay the TIF
Borrowings, a portion of the proceeds of which will reimburse the cost of the eligible
activities completed on the Property pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement
to be executed by the Developer after approval of this Plan (the ?Reimbursement
Agreement?), in accordance with Section 13(b) of Act 381. Some eligible activities may
commence prior to the adoption of this Plan and to the extent permitted by Act 381 shall
be reimbursable pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, in no event shall any tax increment revenue generated and
captured pursuant to this Plan be used to directly pay or reimburse the Developer for
eligible activities.

In the event this Plan contemplates the capture of tax increment revenue derived from
?taxes levied for school operating purposes? (as de?ned by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and
hereinafter referred to as ?School Taxes?), the Developer acknowledges and agrees that
reimbursement for the cost of eligible activities with proceeds of obligations to which the
DBRA has pledged tax increment revenue derived from Local Taxes, or Speci?c Taxes
that are considered Local Taxes, (as these capitalized terms are de?ned by Act 381) is
contingent upon: the Developer receiving at least the initial applicable work plan
approvals by the MSF and EGLE, as may be required pursuant to Act 381, within 180 days
after the date this Plan is approved by the governing body, or such other date as the DBRA
may agree to in writing.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending on the nature and extent of environmental contamination and other unknown
conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities
encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from the proceeds of
obligations to which the DBRA has pledged tax increment revenue from tax increment
revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the
Reimbursement Agreement and Act 381. No costs of eligible activities will be quali?ed
for reimbursement except to the extent permitted in accordance with Act 381. The
Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the total cost of eligible activities
subject to payment or reimbursement, provided that the total cost of" eligible activities
subject to payment or reimbursement under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not
exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment F. As long as the total costs are not
exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be adjusted after the date this Plan is

approved by the governing body, to the extent the adjustments do not violate the terms of
the approved EGLE or MSF work plan.

Impact of Tax Increment Financing on Taxing Jurisdictions (Section 

This Plan anticipates the capture of tax increment revenues to repay the principal of and
interest on the TIF Borrowings, a portion of the proceeds of which will reimburse the
Developer for the costs of eligible activities under this Plan in accordance with Act 381.
Subject to Section 13(b)(16) of Act 381, a table of estimated tax increment revenues to be
captured is attached to this Plan as Attachment G. The estimated cost of eligible activities
provided in Attachment exceeds the amount of tax increment revenues that is projected
to be captured over the life of the Plan; however, approval of this Plan by the governing
body shall authorize the DBRA to utilize the maximum amount of tax increment revenues
generated and captured under this Plan to repay the principal of and interest on the TIF
Borrowings, a portion of the proceeds of which will reimburse the approved costs of
eligible activities incurred in connection with this Plan.

Tax increments are projected to be captured and applied to reimbursement of eligible
activity costs and payment of DBRA administrative and operating expenses, and (ii) make

capture and deposit in the LBRF is currently estimated at Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, all funds, if any, deposited in the LBRF shall be used in accordance with
Section 8 ofAct 381.

J. Brownfield Redevelopment Fund (Section 8a; Section 

The DBRA shall pay to the Department of Treasury at least once annually an amount equal

Project Description

Project Description Mack Conner Brown?eld Project

Project Developer: The City of Detroit Brown?eld Redevelopment
Authority (DBRA) on behalf of the City of Detroit

Project Location: 387.15 acres located at and around the existing
Mack Engine Plant (11509 Mack Avenue)

Capital Investment: billion

Eligible Activities: ~$107,590,000 (Department Speci?c Activities,
Demolition, Site Preparation, 15% Contingency on
aforementioned activity costs and Preparation 
Implementation of a Brown?eld Plan and Act 381
Work Plan.)

Type of Eligible Property: Targeted Redevelopment Area, ?Facility,?
Functionally Obsolete or Adjacent Contiguous

Project Overview: Fiat Automobiles will revive and expand the existing
Mack Engine 11 Plant (vacant since 2012) which will produce a new generation of Jeep
cars and SUVs to keep the company competitive in a constantly-evolving international
market. The expansion is expected to add an additional 600,000 square feet of production
space and create approximately 3,850 jobs within the City of Detroit. The DBRA will
assist FCA with acquiring an additional 270+ acres of land and preparing the new
property (by completing demolition, site preparation and environmental remediation
activities) for the new development. A signi?cant portion of St Jean Street (from 
Warren to Kercheval Street) will be abandoned as part of this transaction, to redirect
traf?c away from the facility.

The Mack Engine Plant Complex currently encompasses 1.4 million square feet and is a
production facility for the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Wrangler as well as the Dodge Grand
Caravan. The acquisition of 270+ acres will make room for an expansion to the existing
Mack 11 Plant and also create additional space for storing vehicles.

Demolition, site preparation and remediation activities will begin in earnest in July 2019
and may take twelve to eighteen months to complete. FCA anticipates that the Mack 11
Plant will be operational by late 2020.

The Project also anticipates local and state approval of a Michigan Public Act 198
Industrial Facilities Exemption tax abatement and Act 381 Work Plans.

RE: Mack Conner Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

Dear Ms. Kanalos,

The Detroit Brown?eld Redevelopment Authority (DBRA) has asked that the Planning and
Development Department to review and comment on the Mack Conner Brown?eld

Redevelopment Plan (the ?Plan").

The DBRA is the project developer (?Developer?). The property in the Plan is located on 339
acres of land surrounding the current Mack Engine Plant at 11509 Mack Avenue located on
Detroit?s eastside. generally bounded by Interstate 94 to the North. Conner Street to the East.
the Detroit River to the South, and the Lillibridge Street to the West.

The Plan will consist of the? signi?cant renovation and expansion of the current Fiat 
Corporation (FCA) Mack Engine Plant into a state?of-the?art assembly plant for a new
generation of FCA vehicles. The adjacent Jefferson North Assembly Plant (JNAP) will also
undergo signi?cant renovations and expansion in order to produce an additional new FCA
vehicle. The DBRA is assisting with FCA's expansion by assembling 215 acres of land which
will be used for employee parking, trailer marshaling, and car storage. The new and expanded
assembly plants will result in the closure of a portion of St. Jean Street as well as stormwater
detention basins and sound screen walls. The Planning Development Department commits
to working with the community on the design of the stormwater feature and the sound screen
walls.

Total investment in the new assembly plant is estimated to be approximately $2 billion and will
result in approximately 4,950 new jobs.

The review for this brown?eld plan is complete and all comments have been forwarded to the
developer. No adverse comments were received. The Planning and Development Department
recommends approval of the brownfield plan as submitted.

Sincerely,



Maurice 0. Cox
Director

RE: Support of Brown?eld Plan for FCA Plant Expansion

Dear Ms. Kanalos:

On behalf of Atlas Wholesale Food Company, I would like to express our support
for the FCA Plant Expansion project and Brown?eld Plan proposed for Detroit?s
Eastside near Mack Avenue and Conner Street.

Atlas has been operating for 70 years in the City of Detroit and our warehouse is
located next to the Mack Avenue FCA plant. The $2.5 billion expansion and
renovations of the Jefferson North and Mack Avenue plants into state?of?the-art
assembly plants will not only create jobs in our area, but i believe it can be
transformational to the entire Conner Creek industrial area. The land deal will
help remove blighted properties and be a pivot point for the entire area.

As part of the plant expansion project, Atlas Wholesale Food Company supports
the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (DBRA) pursuing a Brownfield
Plan to reimburse the DBRA and City for costs related to assembling and
redeveloping land for the project.

This overall development will remove numerous blighted and contaminated
properties from the neighborhood and bring thousands of new jobs to the City of
Detroit. This is a once in a generation development and Atlas Wholesale Food

Company offers its support.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

RE: 12000 E. Jefferson, Detroit, Michigan DTE Conner Creek Power Plant

Dear Ms. Kanalos:

The Of?ce of the Assessor has reviewed the proposed project for the property located at the DTE Conner Creek
Power Plant, 12000 E. Jefferson, Detroit, Michigan (the ?Property?) in anticipation of the Property being included in
a future brown?eld plan.

The Brown?eld Redevelopment Financing Act (?Act 381?), as amended, requires that a level or IV assessor
make a ?nding that the Property is ?functionally obsolete", as de?ned by Act 381, as amended, and provide the
underlying basis for that Opinion.

Search 2(u) of Act 381, as amended, de?nes ?functionally Obsolete" as property that is "unable to be used to
adequately perform the function for which it was intended due to a substantial loss in value resulting from factors
such as overcapacity, changes in technology, de?ciencies or super adequacies in design, or other similar factors that
affect the property itself or the property?s relationship with other surrounding property." MCL 

The Assessors Manual de?nes functional obsolescence as ?a loss in value occurring in a structure caused by changes
in design, overcapacity, or inadequacy.? Michigan Assessors Manual, Vol. I Glossary, p. 239.

The Of?ce of the Assessor has reviewed the Property and has found that it ?ts within the de?nition of functional
obsolescence. The DTE Conner Creek Power Plant does not meet current ef?ciency standards for the building to
operate as power plant. The plant is over 100 years old and had limited utility in the early 1990?s. The plant "went
dark" in 2008 because it was too costly to keep the coal plant open. This coal facility is no long viable in today?s
market which is now developing wind, solar and natural gas energy technology and in addition, the plant would be
operating at a 10% output compared to other current operating plants.

The Of?ce of the Assessor ?nds the Property to be functionally obsolete within the de?nition of the Assessors
Manual and the Brown?eld Redevelopment Financing Act.

Dear Ms. Kanalos:

The Of?ce of the Assessor has reviewed the proposed project for the property located at Mack I Detroit Engine
Plant 11509 Mack Avenue. Detroit, Michigan (the ?Property?) in anticipation of the Property being included in a
future brown?eld plan.

The Brown?eld Redevelopment Financing Act (?Act 381"), as amended, requires that a level or IV assessor
make a ?nding that the Property is ?functionally obsolete?, as de?ned by Act 381, as amended, and provide the
underlying basis for that opinion.

adequately perform the function for which it was intended due to a substantial loss in value resulting from factors

such as overcapacity, changes in technology. de?ciencies or super adequacies in design, or other similar factors that

The Assessors Manual de?nes functional obsolescence as ?a loss in value occurring in a structure caused by changes
in design, overcapacity, or inadequacy.? Michigan Assessors Manual, Vol. I Glossary. p. 239.

The Of?ce of the Assessor has reviewed the Property and has found that it ?ts within the de?nition of functional
obsolescence. The current con?guration for the Mack I Engine Plant does not meet current ef?ciency standards for
the building to operate as an automotive assembly plant. The exterior of?ces of the Engine Plant will remain. All
interior of?ce structures inside the plant will need to be demolished, the interior roof system will need to be
recon?gured and raised, the ?ooring will need to be recon?gured to accommodate new machinery and equipment
along with new mechanical and electrical systems and a tunnel will be constructed to connect Mack I to Mack II
plants.

The Of?ce of the Assessor ?nds the Property to be functionally obsolete within the de?nition of the Assessors
Manual and the Brown?eld RedeveIOpment Financing Act.

and arches. Repetitive details. such as dentils or areading beneath cornices or
window and door surrounds. contribute to textural interest. as do the clav pantile
roofs of the rectorv and religions building. The activities building features
smooth ?nishes. such as aluminum and painted surfaces. In general. the district
is rich in textural relationships.

Jennifer K, Staff, informed the board the Ford Piquette Plant roof restoration went
through the Historic District Commission to get a Certi?cate of Appropriateness and they
are good to go. Work has commenced despite the federal government shutdown which
slowed it down.

The Cass Corridor survey was impacted as a result of the federal govermnent shutdown
and HDAB was informed it would be noti?ed if it received the grant this summer to begin
the survey in the fall of this year. Despite the delay, HDAB will begin to hold public
meetings to inform the community of the upcoming survey. In the spirit of this survey,
HDAB and CPC met with Wayne State University Director of Flaming Ashley lintoff to
discuss their most recent update to their Master Plan because they own a large number of
historic buildings. Ashley lintoff will be invited at a future date to give a presentation to
the Board.

Deputy Director Chapman informed the Board that the MacKenzie House on the Wayne
State University campus is currently in the staging process to be moved. The MacKenzie
House is in a locally designated historic district. Because it is Wayne State University they
do not have to abide by the HDAB ordinance like the Detroit Public Schools. They are
also not required to abide by zoning ordinances. Wayne State University wants to retain
the National Register status, which needs to be determined by the National Park Service
Keeper of the NRHP. HDAB will also need to address it at the local designation because
the boundaries will be changed as a result of the move. Board Member ogel addressed
her concern that the movement might cause structural damage. Deputy Director Chapman
shared the building is being moved by the same reputable company that moved the Gem
Theater and Elmwood Bar and Grill, both on the National Register. The primary interest
is that the House is being moved from its original location and HDAB will be required to
reinvestigate how to handle the boundary issue. Jennifer Reinhardt added that there are

The Planning and Economic Development Standing Committee approved the Emanuel
Stewart secondary street sign, famed boxing trainer for the Kronk Gym. Thomas

speak for the approval of the sign. The original location of the sign has been moved from
33rd Street and McGraw where the was located and no longer extant to Jefferson and
St. Aubin where he bought the building and started the 1940 Chop House.

There is an ongoing reexamination of the Secondary Streets ordinance and propose
amendments.

HDAB continues to work on other Secondary Streets to include David Ruf?n of the
Temptations and the bartender from the Bayview Yacht Club who invented the Hummer

Description of the Proposed Historic District

Deborah Goldstein, HDAB staff member, provided a description of the proposed
Shalom Fellowship International Ministries/Fourteenth Avenue Methodist Episcopal
Church Historic District

The boundaries of the proposed district are:
On the North the centerline of Poplar Street;
On the East the centerline of Fourteenth Avenue;

On the South the south line of Lot 287 of the Subdivision of the Godfroy Farm,
L1 P293 Plats, and

On the West the centerline of the alley running north-south between Fourteenth
Avenue and Fifteenth Avenue.

Boundary Justification: The boundary description above includes the three contiguous
lots upon which the religious building and rectory are situated.

The proposed district appears to meet National Register Criteria A for its religious
history which represents the ?ourishing of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Detroit
through the merger of two smaller congregations and Criteria for its early twentieth
century Neo-Gothic religious architecture and associated Prairie style rectory. Its
period of signi?cance is de?ned as 1912, when the building was constructed, to 1985
when the Shalom Temple Congregation purchased a larger historic building known as
the Fourth Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church.

Public Statements

Debra Allen, Administrative Assistant, Shalom Fellowship International Ministries 
presented a statement of support indicating that the congregation recognizes the
bene?ts of this local historic designation and will further protect and promote the

National Register Nomination Checker Cab Taxi Garage and O??ice Building
Presentation

Ruth Mills, Architectural Historian, Quinn Evans Architects, provided a summary report
of the completed National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for the
nomination of the Checker Cab Taxi Garage and Of?ce Building.

The Checker Cab Taxi Garage and Of?ce is a three-story, rectangular building measuring
approximately 292 by 124 feet, located at 2128 Trumbull Avenue in Detroit?s Corktown
neighborhood, one block north of Michigan Avenue. The building sits on the block
bounded on the west by Trumbull Street, on the north by Plum Street, on the east by 8th
Street and on the south by Elizabeth Street. It occupies the entire north half of the block
stretching from Trumbull to 8th Street and extends to the lot lines on the west, north and
east. The south half of the block is being redeveloped with new commercial/apartment
buildings and an activated alley between them and the Checker Cab Building.

The period of signi?cance is 1927 to 1931, encompassing its original construction and
acquisition by Checker Cab Company. The Checker Cab Taxi Garage and Of?ce
quali?es under the following National Register Listings:

- Criterion A - At the local level, as the headquarters of Detroit?s oldest and largest
taxi company, founded in 1921 and operated out of the same building ?om 1931

to 2016; and for its association with the development of Detroit?s taxicab industry
in the 19203 and 19303.

0 Criterion - At the local level, for its architectural and engineering importance as
a largely intact steel and concrete frame garage structure dating from the 1920s.

Keith Dye, Board Member expressed concern relative to the building construction which
appeared to be two (2) buildings from the rear.

Tyson McCarthy, Project Manager, Soave Real Estate indicated that it was one (1)
building with a slope in the middle.

Mr. Dye also questioned whether the lighting was original. Mr. McCarthy indicated that
the lighting was specifically designed by Quinn Evans to resemble the original lighting.

Louis Fisher, Board Member expressed interest about the environmental characteristics
of temperature control and the energy e?iciency measures.

Mr. McCarthy explained that the VAC system used is a VRF System which is more
efficient than a conventional split system that allows for control of eight (8) units at a
time; this system culls that down to four (4) units.

Mr. Fisher also expressed interest in the building envelope, type of windows used, wall
insulation and roof.

The windows in the residential units are replacements composed of modern insulated
glass with dimmer panes. The remaining original windows that were refurbished are
installed in the garage portion of the building. The walls have been updated, most are
insulated and the roof is new.

Calvin Jackson, Board Member asked if the developer planned to expand.

Mr. McCarthy indicated the expansion will consist of ?ve (5) additional buildings, all
recent construction. Consideration of the historic nature of the building and the
neighborhood has been very important to the developer.

Under HDAB staff recommendation, the board voted unanimously that the Checker Cab
Taxi Garage and Of?ce meets the National Register Criteria A and at the local level
and possesses the required integrity. The Board unanimously recommended that the
nomination be moved forward to the State Historic Preservation Review Board, along
with staff comments.

Re: Evaluation of Exemption of New Personal Property, PA. 328 of 1998 for Coyote Logistics,
LLC to be located at 1700 W. Fort Street

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Assessments Division of the Finance Department has reviewed the application of the
Exemption of New Personal Property for Coyote Logistics, LLC to be located at
1700 W. Fort Street

State Tax Commission (STC) Bulletin No. 9 of I998 requires (5) conditions are met for the
exemption of New Personal Property. The conditions are:

l. The personal property must be New Personal Property. New Personal Property means that it
was not previously subject to taxation under the General Property Tax Act.

2. The personal property must be located in an Eligible Local Assessing District. P.A. 328 of
1998 de?nes a Assessing District as a city, village or township that contains an
ELIGIBLE DISTRESSED AREA. The City of Detroit is an eligible distressed area.

3. The New Personal Property must be OWNED or LEASED by an ELIGIBLE BUSINESS.
The New Personal Property and eligible business must be located in an ELIGIBLE
DISTRICT on tax day. [700 W. Fort Street is located in the Downtown Development
Authority.

4. The eligible local assessing district must adopt a resolution that provides for the exemption.

The Of?ce of the Assessor ?nds that Tata Technologies ful?lls the ?rst four requirements of STC
Bulletin #9 of I998 and may be considered for Exemption of New Personal Property at this time.

Sincerely

Charles Ericson. MMAO

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for New Personal Property Tax Exemption (PA 328) at 1702 W.
Fort Street (Petition 903)
DATE: June 14, 2019
CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, Central Region, Planning and Development

In order to ensure consistency with the City's Master Plan of Policies, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public
Act 328 of 1998 (section 207.773), the Planning and Development Department?s Planning Division submits
the following interpretation for the proposed New Personal Property Tax Exemption. The Petitioner is
Coyote Logistics, LLC,

Location and Project Proposal: The overall project seeks to rehabilitate a historic building and transform it
into a mixed-use development with office and retail space on the lower floors and an addition atop the
historic structure to create additional apartment units (11 units). The project will create retail and
restaurant/cafe space on the first two floors and one subgrade floor; office space on the middle two floors,
33 residential units on the upper two floors, and 22 residential units on the fifth floor. The rehabilitation
includes 13,908 square feet of parking in the basement level to support the residential units and the 11 new
facilities.

Existing Site Information: The current site is the home of the historic Edson, Moore and Company Building.
The building was construction in 1913, is located within the Corktown Historic District, and is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

Interpretation: The project will add to the stock of emerging businesses and strengthen residential loft
conversions already observed in the Corktown area. Additionally, the project is served by two bus lines and
the project could encourage additional bus stops and increased ridership along Fort Street.

Master Plan interpretation
The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential-Commercial (MRC). Mixed Residential-Commercial
areas consist primarily of high density housing developed compatibly with commercial and/or institutional
uses. This classification is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major commercial activity, major
thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city."
The following policies of the Corktown neighborhood describe the following recommendations:

Policy 4.3: ?Encourage high-density mixed used development to replace obsolete industrial and

commercial properties along Fort?

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the area.

Coyote Logistics, LLC is committed to hiring talented new employees, and encouraging new hires
to choose homes close to the office. Coyote often selects offices in revitalized neighborhoods,
close to public transit, to attract top talent looking for environmentally-friendly, and close
commutes. Coyote expects a number of new hires will either come from existing Detroit
residents, or that new hires will choose to become Detroit residents.

Please give a detailed description of thejobs available as listed in the above chart.

Professional employees will be mostly National Account Managers and Operations Coordinators
at Coyote Logistics, LLC. A few additional administrative and managerial positions will also be
available. The majority of the employees at 1700 W. Fort Street will have the primary goal of
connecting customers with products to ship with truck drivers with capacity.

Will this development cause any relocation that will create new Detroit residents?

This new project will relocate 175 jobs from Ann Arbor to Detroit. It is very possible that some
existing employees will choose to move closer to the Detroit office. It is also likely that a large
number of the expected new hires will be or become Detroit residents.

When is construction slated to begin?
If Detroit is selected, Coyote expects to begin leasehold improvements in C11 2019.
What is the expected completion date of construction?

If Detroit is selected, Coyote expects leasehold improvement construction should be completed
by July 2019.

Economic Advantages

Completion of the rehabilitated facility is expected to, and will at the time of issuance of an

OPRA exemption certificate, increase commercial activity, create employment opportunities, rehabilitate
and preserve a historic building and revitalize an urban area in the community in which the facility is
situated. The development as a whole will result in additional tax revenue for all taxingjurisdictions. The
building will bridge Corktown to the west with Detroit?s CDB district.

The developer anticipates investing $7,750,018 in real property improvements which is expected to
increase the property?s taxable value to over $4,000,000, more than doubling the real property taxes.
Further, the project is anticipated to create 150 full time equivalent jobs and support 70 temporary
construction jobs. The Developer is working with local contractor organizations and local labor groups to
increase job opportunities for Detroit residents.

Approval of an exemption certi?cate is critical to making the project economically viable. The applicant
is not delinquent in the payment of any taxes related to the facility.

RE: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Certificate 600 Ventures LLC
PrOperty Address: 600 W. Lafayette
Parcel Numbers: 04000134-67

Dear Mr. 

The Office Of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
certificate application for the property located at 600 W. Lafayette in the Downtown area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for granting Obsolete Property Rehabilitation certificates under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation ofincreased market value upon completion ofnew construction and /or significant rehabilitation of existing commercial
property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not necessarily generate
additional market value.

600 Ventures II LLC plans to rehabilitate the existing building, adding floor space above the existing studios and renovating the
existing office space into office (32,017 sq. hotel amenities (14,098 sq. affordable garden level co?office space (22,517 sq.
restaurant space (6,233 sq. ft.) and first floor retail space (2,110 sq. ft). The building consists ofa 32,500 square foot five-
story office building built in 1936, a 5,406 square foot three-story office building built in 1951 and a 35,156 square foot two-story
office building built in 1951 located on .724 acres ofland.

The 2019 values are:

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete and
contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or modify the
property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition. The project is expected to increase commercial
activity, create employment opportunities, rehabilitate and preserve a historic building and revitalize and urban area.

Rehabilitation will include extensive renovations to the existing office space, replacing the HVAC, replacing the electrical and
plumbing systems with more eco-efficient and modern systems along with construction of additional floor spa ce above the
existing studio. A sky bridge will also be constructed to connect the building to the proposed new hotel on the adjacent property.

A field investigation indicated that the property located at 600 W. Lafayette is eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property
Rehabilitation Act under PA. 146 of 2000, as amended.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District for property located at
600 West Lafayette

DATE: August 18, 2018

CC: Maurice Cox, Director

In order to insure that the issuance of a certificate for an Obsolete Property District is in
conformance with the City?s Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to
increase commercial activity; create, retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an
urban area; or increase the number of residents in a community, pursuant to State of Michigan,
Public Act 149 of 2002 (section 125.2788), the Planning and Development Department?s
Planning Division submits the following interpretation.

Petitioner:
600 Ventures II, LLC

Project Description:
Rehabilitation of five story building to improve existing office and create space for new hotel
amenities. The building will be connected by a sky bridge to the new construction to the north

at 659 Howard

Project Location:
600 West Lafayette

Interpretation:
The Master Plan Future General Land Use designation for the site is Major Commercial. Major

Commercial areas are generally distinguished by high density of?ce buildings with ground ?oor
retail. Included within these areas may be department stores, specialized shops and services catering
to area of?ce or residential land uses. Areas should be accessible to mass transit routes and
automobile parking located on the street or in structures. Ground level activity should be pedestrian?
oriented. Downtown and New Center are Detroit?s major commercial areas.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use designation of the
area.

Description of Facility Pr0posed Use of the Facility

Presently, the facility located at 13400 Mt. Elliott is an obsolete structure. The building is
a 142,110 square foot building, consisting of 131,040 square feet of light manufacturing space,
7500 square feet of of?ce space and 3570 square feet of warehouse space. It was at one time home
to a steel fabrication operation, but most recently, due to its obsolescence, housed only 12

employees primarily occupying the of?ce space.

13400 Mount Elliott Street LLC is a sister company of Gallagher-Kaiser Corporation
(?Gallagher-Kaiser? or the ?Company?), a manufacturer of complex construction and paint
?nishing equipment systems primarily sold to the automotive industry. Gallagher-Kaiser provides
engineering and custom steel fabrication for automotive manufacturers and is a strategic supplier
to multiple original equipment manufacturers 

Gallagher-Kaiser has secured more than a billion dollars of current and prospective project
contracts for which steel fabrication will be necessary and would like to expand its existing
operations to house this new and growing business while also diversifying and expanding
fabrication and manufacturing capabilities to market to other industry segments. This strategic goal
would be achieved through the creation of a new World Class Steel Fabrication Center of
Excellence in Detroit, Michigan. Gallagher-Kaiser presently uses the building next door
to 13400 Mt. Elliott and will combine its operations at its current facility with the new facility to

create its COE Campus.

This COE Campus will house approximately 300 new, skilled-trades jobs. The COE will
be the ?rst of its kind in Detroit and possibly the United States. Currently, when Gallagher-Kaiser
has increased manufacturing requirements or needs to provide unique or high-demand support to
projects outside Michigan, it subcontracts (or outsources) to other manufacturers situated outside
Michigan, thereby routinely sending jobs and work to workers outside the state of Michigan. The
COE, when complete, will allow the company to employ full-time, permanent workers in the city
of Detroit and eliminate a signi?cant portion of jobs currently outsourced. Additionally,
Gallagher-Kaiser?s out-of-state customers will now be supported by the Detroit COE. Essentially,
the steel fabrication and manufacturing work will be primarily performed at the new Detroit COE
and product or systems manufactured at the Detroit COE will then be shipped to project locations
both within and outside the State of Michigan. In short, the COE would relocate out-of-state jobs

to Michigan.

The company is committed to training unskilled workers to ?ll these new positions. Given
the critical shortage in Michigan, and particularly in Detroit, of a skilled workforce, Gallagher?
Kaiser believes that the only way to ensure proper staf?ng of the COE will be to invest in training.
Training will include education and on the job training and apprenticeship Opportunities using state
of the art laser cutting equipment, advanced manufacturing methods, and engineering techniques
that are new to the industry and likely not even available in current skilled trade educational
programs. The COE expansion will allow Gallagher-Kaiser to take an enormous ?rst step for the
State of Michigan in educating, training, and transforming the current workforce of local unskilled
labor into skilled tradesmen/women with transferrable work experiences that are in high demand
to meet the growing demands of the region?s manufacturers and construction companies.

General Nature Extent of Restoration, Replacement, or Construction

In order to complete its COE Campus, Gallagher-Kaiser will perform extensive
rehabilitation to the building located at 13400 Mt. Elliott. First, there are environmental hazards
that must be abated, primarily due to asbestos. Gallagher?Kaiser has already begun asbestos
remediation to the windows. To restore the property to a useful state, Gallagher-Kaiser will
improve or repair the electrical system, foundation and gas distribution system. Additionally, the
Company will install additional doors, an IT network and an exhaust system. The building also
requires interior remodeling and build-out, facade improvements and street and parking
improvements. Finally, to connect the property to its existing facility, Gallagher-Kaiser will install
a ramp between the two parcels. Once these improvements are complete, Gallagher-Kaiser will
begin moving existing and installing new equipment.

Re: lndustrial Facilities Exemption Certificate Request 13400 Mount Elliott Street LLC
Property Address: 13400 Mt. Elliott
Parcel Number: 15014245.

Dear Mr. Cox

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the request for an Industrial Facilities Exemption
Rehabilitation certi?cate for the property located at 13400 Mt. located in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Industrial Facilities Exemptions under PA 198 of 1974, as amended, is based upon the anticipation
that granting the exemption is a bene?t to the city and that expansion, retention, or location ofan eligible business will not
occur without this exemption. PA 198 of 1974, as amended, also provides a tax incentive to manufacturers in order to enable
renovation and expansion of aging facilities, building of new facilities, and to promote establishment of high tech facilities.

The project as proposed by 13400 Mount Elliott Street LLC would allow for the rehabilitation to the building to abate
environment hazards, primarily due to asbestos, improve or repair the electrical system, foundation and gas distribution
system. Additionally, the company will install additional doors, an IT network and an exhaust system along with interior
remodeling and build-out, facade improvements and street and parking improvements. The estimated total cost of the
project is $8,174,296 ($3,557,734 for real property and $4,616,562 for personal property) and is expected to create 110 new
jobs while retaining 54 existing jobs.

The 2019 real property values are as follows:

 

 

Building Assessed BUildif'IQ Land Assessed Value Land
Parcel Address Value (SEV) Taxable Value (SEV) Taxable Value
15014245. 13400 Mt Elliott 1.257.300 1.257.300 153,400 163.400

 

 

 

 

 

The 2019 personal property values are as follows:

 

Parcel Address Personal Property Owner Assessed Value (SEV) Taxable Value
1599126600 13400 Mt Central Steel and Wire Co 141.300 141.300

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A field investigation indicated that the proposed project located in the property address as described above is eligible as
outlined under PA 198 of 1974. as amended.

Slncerely

PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT 
T0: Veronica Farley, Housing and Revitalization Department
FROM: Esther Yang, Planning Development Department
RE: Master Plan Interpretation for proposed industrial Development District (IDD) for
property located at 13400 Mt. Elliott
DATE: December 21, 2018
CC: Maurice Cox, Director

in order to ensure consistency with the City?s Master Plan of Policies, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public
Act 198 of 1974, Section the Planning and Development Department?s Planning Division
submits the following interpretation for the establishment of a Plant Rehabilitation District.

Petitioner: 13400 Mount Elliott, LLC

Project Location: 13400 Mount Elliott

Project Proposal: Project seeks to rehabilitate an under-utilized, 142,110 square foot structure, built in
1947 into a ?Steel Fabrication Center of Excellence.? The project seeks to improve the structure and the
surrounding area to create a cohesive campus with its current facility at 13710 Mt. Elliott. Together, the
applicant?s two buildings will serve as their global headquarters.

Master Plan Interpretation

The Master Plan Future General Land Use designation is General industrial. General Industrial areas
should consist of areas for light and heavy industrial uses such as manufacturing, assembly or
warehousing. General Industrial areas are characterized as large sites with considerable truck or rail
traffic. General industrial areas should have freeway and rail access and be located along a major
thoroughfare. Large-scale industrial uses may include producing or assembling components, auto
manufacturing, structural steel fabrication, chemical plants, power plants, etc.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use Designation of the area.

Economic Advantages

The subject property has underperformed as a taxable interest in the City for a number of years, and this
will assist with restoring its productivity. Completion of this Project will bring additional investment and
stabilization to the neighborhood. It will also promote a walkable community in Detroit. This creative
project will be integrating on-site parking in the building?s design and a rooftop green roof to manage
urban stormwater, making this project a lasting, sustainable development for downtown Detroit.

The developer anticipates investing $21,571,422 in real improvements to the property which is expected
to increase the property?s taxable value to over $6,700,000. The new retail development will expand the
local economy and increase commercial activity in the area. The proposed project will support the
nearby convention center through the construction of a new 156,-room Cambria hotel.

Approval of an exemption certificate is critical to making the project economically viable. The applicant
is not delinquent in the payment of any taxes related to the facility.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Commercial Rehabilitation District for 659 Howard
DATE: October 10, 2018
CC: Maurice Cox, Director

In order to ensure that the issuance of a certificate for a Commercial Rehabilitation District is
consistent with the City?s Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to
increase commercial activity; create, retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban
area; or increase the number of residents in a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public
Act 210 of 2005 (section 207.841), the Planning and Development Department's Planning
Division submits the following interpretation.

Petitioner:
600 Ventures II, LLC

Project Description:
Redevelopment of vacant former parking lot with construction of six story mixed-use

development with ground floor commercial, 123 room hotel and 24 residential units with
integrated parking.

Project Location:
659 Howard

Interpretation:
The Master Plan Future General Land Use designation of the site is Major Commercial. Major

Commercial areas are generally distinguished by high density office buildings with ground floor
retail. Included within these areas may be department stores, specialized shops and services
catering to area office or residential land uses. Areas should be accessible to mass transit routes
and automobile parking located on the street or in structures. Ground level activity should be
pedestrian-oriented. Downtown and New Center are Detroit's major commercial areas.

The development conforms to the Future General Land Use designation for the area.

RE: Commercial Rehabilitation Certificate - 600 Ventures II LLC
Property Address: 659 Howard
Parcels Number: 04000180.002L

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Of?ce of the Chief Financial Of?cer, Office of the Assessor, has reviewed the Commercial Rehabilitation certi?cate application
for the properties located at 659 Howard in the Downtown area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for issuing Commercial Rehabilitation certi?cates under PA 210 of 2005, as amended, is based on the anticipation of
increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or signi?cant rehabilitation of existing commercial property and
commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not necessarily generate additional market
value.

The site presently consists of a parking lot on .742 acres of land. 600 Ventures LLC proposes new construction of a 6-story mixed-
use development with ground floor retail space (1,859 sq. 156 hotel rooms (85,948 sq. and two levels (151 spaces, 58,224
sq. ft.) of parking. The new construction will be state-of?the-art including green mechanical and electrical systems with a green roof
for hotel guests. The new construction of the Cambria The Ashton Hotel is expected to increase commercial activity, create
employment and revitalize the urban area.

The 2019 values are as follows:

 

 

Building Assessed Building Land an VJIuii Land
Parcel Address Value (SEV) Taxable Value (SEV) Taxable Value
04000180.002l 659 Howard - - 1.270.700 1.270.700

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 210 of 2005, as amended. It applies to a building or a group of contiguous
buildings, a portion of a building or group of contiguous buildings previously used for commercial or industrial purposes, obsolete
industrial property, and vacant property which, within the immediately preceding 15 years, was operating as a commercial business
enterprise.

A review ofthe general plans, along with the criteria set forth under the Commercial Rehabilitation Act, indicated that the proposed

project located at 659 Howard is eligible as it pertains to the Commercial Rehabilitation certificate criteria under P.A. 210 of 2005,
as amended.

(441 7 Second; The Sheridan)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

On behalf of Sheridan Propco LLC, a Michigan limited liability company (the ?Owner?),
please accept this letter as a request to establish a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone pursuant to
MCL 207.771 for the parcel of property described on Attachment A and depicted on

Attachment B.

The Owner proposes to rehabilitate a 91 unit residential building located at 4417 Second
Avenue in the Midtown area. The rehabilitation will include facade restoration, electrical upgrades
and metering, plumbing upgrades, roof work, front entrance masonry, window replacement, and
common area and unit upgrades.

Upon completion of the rehabilitation and issuance of a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone
certi?cate for the property, twenty percent of the apartments will be offered at rent rates considered
affordable to those with income not greater than 80% of the Area Median Income for the Detroit-
Warren-Livonia MSA (based upon rent not exceeding 30% of income). Additional information
about the rehabilitation investment will be included in a separate application for the Neighborhood

Enterprise Zone certi?cate.

Please see the attached letter from the Owner?s member explaining their commitment and
experience in voluntarily addressing the needs of current residents. Their track record is

impressive.

Each apartment in the building is considered a ?Rehabilitated Facility? pursuant to the
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Act, thereby satisfying the requirement of MCL 207.7730) that
the zone include ten or more ?Rehabilitated Facilities? for the establishment of a neighborhood
enterprise zone in a ?quali?ed downtown revitalization district?. The general area, including the
many nearby businesses, is an area ?zoned and primarily used for business? and therefore the
proposed zone is located in a ?quali?ed downtown revitalization district? (MCL

While this is all exciting, and still hard to believe given the state of the city not so long ago,
many people are unaware of the struggle and displacement of low-income tenants in some of
Detroit?s more established neighborhoods. These individuals often build their lives in the prewar,
multifamily buildings found in such neighborhoods, though much of the press on Detroit?s
renaissance has focused on glamorous new ground-up projects.

Sturgeon Bay Partners has been forthate enough to acquire and rehabilitate a handful of prewar,
multifamily buildings in the Midtown neighborhood over the past couple of years. We are aware
of the ongoing displacement in gentrifying neighborhoods and have made it our priority to work
with our elderly and low-income tenants to ensure that they are not left behind.

We acquired 665 675 Willis Street in 2017 and began a two-year rehabilitation of
both buildings. The buildings were in terrible condition, with a number of life safety issues,
despite being full of tenants. For example, the front facade and porches of 675 Willis were on the
verge of collapse. We immediately addressed this issue, which cost several hundred thousand
dollars to resolve. Extensive electrical and plumbing work was also needed to bring the buildings
up to code, requiring certain tenants to vacate their units temporarily. During this time, I
personally got to know three low-income tenants. Instead of giving them notices to vacate, we
paid for their move to another of our buildings and maintained their rent at existing levels. We
then lowered the rent for one of these tenants while she was experiencing ?nancial dif?culties.
That tenant has offered to write a letter on Our behalf. When it came time to start work on the
building to which we moved them, we again offered to move these tenants to one of our other
buildings?Sheridan Court?without raising their rent. We paid for the moving expenses of all
three, though only one of the tenants ultimately took us up on our offer to move into Sheridan
Court. We plan to keep that tenant at Sheridan Court for as long as he wishes and will maintain
his current rent by working with Midtown Detroit, Inc., which has a program to subsidize the
rent of low-income tenants.

Our most recent acquisitions are Sheridan Court (on historic Can?eld Street) and the Wellesley,
two multifamily buildings also in the Midtown neighborhood. While the majority of the residents
of these two buildings are young professionals and students at Wayne State University, we have
identi?ed three elderly legacy tenants (including one veteran) who have been living in the

30799403 .1

buildings since the mid?19905. On top of our commitment to turn twenty percent of the units into
affordable housing, we will also help move these three tenants into renovated studio apartments
at $500 rent, which is 50% of the current affordable studio rate. We will continue to
work with Midtown Detroit, Inc. to provide tenant subsidies to anyone who quali?es.

During this exciting time for Detroit, we hope to continue our work in Midtown and beyond,
acquiring and rehabilitating multifamily buildings. But we will do so while supporting the local
community and the people that make this city so special.

Sincerely,
- Vw/

RE: Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Sheridan Propco LLC
Property Address: 4417 Second
Parcel ID: 04000932-9

Mr. Cox:

The Of?ce of the Chief Financial Of?cer, Of?ce of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed The Sheridan
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone, located in the Midtown area in the City of Detroit. The developer's prOposed plan
is to rehabilitate the apartment building.

The rationale for creating NEZ projects under PA 147 Of 1992, as amended, must be based on the anticipation of
market value added to the neighborhood upon completion Of new construction and/or signi?cant rehabilitation of
existing housing stock.

Sheridan Propco LLC plans to rehabilitate the apartment building with 61,576 square foot, four-stories, built in 1930
with 91 residential units. Twenty percent of the apartments will be offered at affordable rates. Rehabilitation will
include facade restoration, electrical upgrades, plumbing upgrades, roof work, front entrance masonry, window
replacement and common area and unit upgrades. The current True Cash Value of the proposed area is $5,402,600
and contains approximately .437 acres Of land. The True Cash Value of this area would be expected to increase due
to the rehabilitation and construction.

Per MCL 207.772 Sec.2 "Rehabilitated facility" means an existing structure or a portion of an existing structure
with a current true cash value of $80,000.00 or less per unit that has or will have as its primary purpose residential
housing, consisting of 1 to 8 units, the owner of which proposes improvements that if done by a licensed contractor
would cost in excess of $5,000.00 per owner-occupied unit or 50% of the true cash value, whichever is less, or
$7,500.00 per nonowner-occupied unit or 50% of the true cash value, whichever is less, or the owner proposes
improvements that would be done by the owner and not a licensed contractor and the cost of the materials would
be in excess of $3,000.00 per owner-occupied unit or $4,500.00 per nonowner?occupied unit and will bring the
structure into conformance with minimum local building code standards for occupancy or improve the livability of
the units while meeting minimum local building code standards. Rehabilitated facility also includes an individual
condominium unit, in a structure with 1 or more condominium units that has as its primary purpose residential
housing, the owner of which proposes the above described improvements. Rehabilitated facility also includes
existing or proposed condominium units in a quali?ed historic building with 1 or more existing or proposed
condominium units. Rehabilitated facility does not include a facility rehabilitated with the proceeds of an insurance
policy for property or casualty loss. A quali?ed historic building may contain multiple rehabilitated facilities.

Per MCL 207.773 Sec. 3. (1) The governing body of a local governmental unit by resolution may designate 1 or
more neighborhood enterprise zones within that local governmental unit. Except as otherwise provided in this
subsection, a neighborhood enterprise zone shall contain not less than 10 platted parcels of land. A neighborhood
enterprise zone located in a quali?ed downtown revitalization district may contain less than 10 platted parcels if
the platted parcels together contain 10 or more facilities. All the land within a neighborhood enterprise zone shall
also be compact and contiguous. Contiguity is not broken by a road, right-of?way, or property purchased or taken
under condemnation if the purchased or condemned property was a single parcel prior to the sale or
condemnation. 

Upon review, it has been determined that this proposed The Sheridan Neighborhood Enterprise Zone district
located in the Midtown area is eligible for designation as a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone per PA 147 of 1992, as

amended.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (PA 147) at 4417 Second
Avenue
DATE: June 1, 2019
CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, Central Region, Planning and Development

In order to ensure consistency with the City?s Master Plan of Policies, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public
Act 147 of 1992 (section 207.773), the Planning and Development Department?s Planning Division submits
the following interpretation for the proposed establishment of Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ). The
Petitioner is Sheridan Propco, LLC.

Location and Project Proposal: The project seeks to rehabilitate a 91-unit residential building in as
rental apartments. Twenty percent of the apartments will be offered at rent rates considered affordable
to those with income not greater than 80% of the Area Median Income.

Master Plan Interpretation:

The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential-Commercial (MRC). Mixed Residential-
Commercial areas consist primarily of high density housing developed compatibly with commercial
and/or institutional uses. This classification is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major
commercial activity, major thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city.

The following policy of the Lower Woodward neighborhood describe the following recommendations
that support/advise this application's proposal:
0 Policy 2.1: Develop Woodward and Cass as high-density mixed-use corridors with housing and
ground-floor commercial
- Policy 5.1: Give high priority to the preservation of historic buildings, especially the restoration
and rehabilitation of building facades
- Policy 5.2: Ensure aesthetic compatibility between new and existing structures and sites
0 Policy 8.1: Recognizing and protect distinctive urban vistas along Woodward to the Central
Business District

The subject site is in close proximity to Cass Avenue and will support existing and emerging
development and businesses in the area.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the area.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

On behalf of Wellesley Propco LLC, a Michigan limited liability company (the ?Owner?),
please accept this letter as a request to establish a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone pursuant to
MCL 207.771 for the parcel of property described on Attachment A and depicted on
Attachment B.

The Owner proposes to rehabilitate a 28 unit residential building located at
651 W. Hancock in the Midtown area. The rehabilitation will include facade restoration, electrical
upgrades and metering, plumbing upgrades, roof work, front entrance masonry, window
replacement, and common area and unit upgrades.

Upon completion of the rehabilitation and issuance of a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone
certi?cate for the property, twenty percent of the apartments will be offered at rent rates considered
affordable to those with income not greater than 80% of the Area Median Income for the Detroit-
Warren?Livonia MSA (based upon rent not exceeding 30% of income). Additional information
about the rehabilitation investment will be included in a separate application for the Neighborhood
Enterprise Zone certi?cate.

Please see the attached letter from the Owner?s member explaining their commitment and
experience in voluntarily addressing the needs of current residents. Their track record is

impressive.

Each apartment in the building is considered a ?Rehabilitated Facility? pursuant to the
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Act, thereby satisfying the requirement of MCL 207.773( 1) that
the zone include ten or more ?Rehabilitated Facilities? for the establishment of a neighborhood
enterprise zone in a ?quali?ed downtown revitalization district?. The general area, including the
many nearby businesses, is an area ?zoned and primarily used for business? and therefore the
proposed zone is located in a ?quali?ed downtown revitalization district? (MCL

the platted parcels together contain 10 or more facilities. All the land within a neighborhood enterprise zone shall
also be compact and contiguous. Contiguity is not broken by a road, right-of?way, or prOperty purchased or taken
under condemnation if the purchased or condemned property was a single parcel prior to the sale or
condemnation.

Upon review, it has been determined that this proposed The Wellesley Neighborhood Enterprise Zone district
located in the Midtown area is eligible for designation as a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone per PA 147 of 1992, as
amended.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (PA 147) at 651 W. Hancock
DATE: June 1, 2019

CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, Central Region, Planning and Development

In order to ensure consistency with the City?s Master Plan of Policies, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public
Act 147 of 1992 (section 207.773), the Planning and Development Department?s Planning Division submits
the following interpretation for the proposed establishment of Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ). The
Petitioner is Wellesley Propco LLC

Location and Project Proposal: The proposed project seeks to rehabilitate a 28-unit residential building
in the Midtown area into rental apartments.

Master Plan interpretation:

The subject site area is designated Mixed Residential-Commercial (MRC). Mixed Residential-
Commercial areas consist primarily of high density housing developed compatibly with commercial
and/or institutional uses. This classification is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major
commercial activity, major thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city.

The following policy of the Lower Woodward neighborhood describe the following recommendations
that support/advise this application?s proposal:
I Policy 2.1: Develop Woodward and Cass as high-density mixed?use corridors with housing and
ground-floor commercial
0 Policy 5.1: Give high priority to the preservation of historic buildings, especially the restoration
and rehabilitation of building facades
0 Policy 5.2: Ensure aesthetic compatibility between new and existing structures and sites
a Policy 8.1: Recognizing and protect distinctive urban vistas along Woodward to the Central
Business District

The subject site is in close proximity to Cass Avenue and will support existing and emerging
development and businesses in the area.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the area.

RE: Request for Establishment of a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) at 1702 W.
Fort Street, Detroit, MI the Issuance of a NEZ Certi?cate

Honorable City Council:

Please accept this letter as a request to establish a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone for the property
located at 1702 Fort St (?Corktown Lofts?). Corletown Lofts LLC, an af?liate of Bedrock
Detroit LLC, is the owner of the property, which is located in the Corktown Historic District.

The overall project will rehabilitate the historic building and transform it into a mixed-use
development. This petition applies solely to the rehabilitation of the ?fth ?oor of the historic
structure to create 22 residential apartment units and the associated parking in the basement of the
rehabilitated structure. In addition, the overall project includes of?ce and retail space on the lower
?oors, and an addition atop the historic structure to create additional apartment units, all of which

are outside the scope of this petition.

Corktown Lofts LLC initially submitted this petition in July 2018. After initial review, the
Assessor?s Of?ce denied the petition on the basis that construction had commenced prior to
establishment of the NEZ Zone. Bedrock subsequently conferred with the Assessor?s Of?ce and
State Tax Commission to review this initial determination. The State Tax Commission ultimately
con?rmed that the petition is timely as no such timing requirement is applicable in the case of an
NEZ for the rehabilitation of a quali?ed historic building. See Section of the NEZ Act,

MCL 207.774.

In order to facilitate completion of the NEZ. process at this point in time. this petition respectfully
requests approval of the NEZ Certi?cate to follow immediately upon this Honorable Body}
establishment of the NEZ Zone. The NEZ Certi?cate is being requested solely for the residential
portion of the rehabilitated structure [the aforementioned 32 units and associated parking] as
further described below.

For questions about this request, please contact Jared Fleisher at aredFleisher@quickenloans.com
or (617) 460-0266.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

General Description of Project

Located on Fort Street just west of the Central Business District, just south of Corktown, and just
north of the West Riverfront, Corktown Lofts will connect multiple districts by creating a vibrant
live-work-piay destination. Speci?eal ly, the project will rehabilitate the historic Edson, Moore and
Company Building into a mixed-use development. The rehabilitation will create retail and
restaurant/cafe space on the ?rst two floors and one subgrade ?oor; of?ce space on the middle two
?oors, and 33 residential units on the upper two ?oors, consisting of rehabilitated facilities on the
?fth floor (22 units) which are the subject of this petition; and a new addition above it (11 units).
The rehabilitation also includes 13,903 SF of parking in the basement level to support the
residential units. Two-thirds of that parking will serve the 22 rehabilitated facilities that are the
subject of this petition (with the remainder serving the 11 new facilities that are outside the scope
.of this petition). As stated above, the NEZ Certi?cate is being requested solely for the residential
portion of the rehabilitated structure (the aforementioned 22 units and associated parking).

The historic facade of the building is being restored to repair deteriorated masonry, and original
window openings that had been ?lled with cinderblock are being re-created to return the facade to
its original grandeur. Historically accurate windows are being installed. Brand new mechanical,
electrical, and plumbing systems are being installed throughout the building, as the previous
systems were fully deteriorated. Three new elevators are being installed to serve the building, as
the existing ones have become deteriorated and unusable. Original hardwood ?oors are being
refurbished where possible and replicated in the remaining areas. New interior space, including
residential units, are being built out. As noted, an addition is being built on top of the building to
deliver additional residential units and house the residential amenities.

Basis for Quali?cation

Location in a Quali?ed Downtown Revitalization District: A quali?ed downtown
revitalization district includes an area ?located within the boundaries of the local governmental
unit in an area that is zoned and primarily used for business as determined by the local
government unit.? MCL The subject parcel, being zoned M4, is located in an
Intensive Industrial District, and is thereby eligible for designation as a Quali?ed Downtown
Revitalization District.

Satisfaction of Platted Parcel Minimum Number of Facilities Requirement: A
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone must contain at least 10 platted parcels of land unless located
in a quali?ed downtown revitalization district. A Neighborhood Enterprise Zone located in a
quali?ed downtown revitalization district may contain less than 10 platted parcels if the
proposed zone contains 10 or more facilities. MCL Under MCL 
each of the proposed residential apartments constitutes a ?Rehabilitated facility? as each is a
portion of an existing structure with a true cash value of less than $80,000 per unit that will
have as its primary purpose residential housing, and as the cost of the proposed improvements

4

exceed the per-unit requirements. Accordingly, the subject parcel (which contains more than
10 rehabilitated facilities) is eligible for designation as a NEZ.

. Satisfaction of Timing Requirement for SubmiSsion: A NEZ Zone petition may be
submitted after issuance of a building permit in the case of a ?quali?ed historic building,?
which is the case here. Corktown Lofts, previously known as the Edson, Moore and Company
Building, was constructed in 1913. The building is located within the Corktown Historic
District and is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.1 After
review, State Tax Commission staff concurred that there are no other timing requirements
under the NEZ Act applicable to the rehabilitation of a quali?ed historic structure, and that the
submission of this petition is thus timely. For reference, Attachment contains the analysis
Bedrock presented to the State Tax Commission on this timing question.

Proicct Schedule

Construction of the project is anticipated to be complete in the second quarter of 2019.

ATTACHMENT C: TIMING REQUIREMENTS FOR REHABILITAITON OF
QUALIFIED HISTORIC BUILDINGS UNDER THE NEZ ACT

Is a building owner required to secure the establishment of a NEZ Zone prior to commencing rehabilitation
of a quali?ed historic building?

SUMMARY OF RESPONSE

No. By its plain terms, the NEZ Act expressly exempts the rehabilitation of a quali?ed historic building
from the only timing requirement under the Act.

ANALYSIS

I The NEZ Act imposes a timing requirement only with respect to the application for the NEZ
Certificate.

0 Section 4(1) addresses the Certi?cate and states that ?Except as
provided in subsection (2) or as otherwise provided by the local governmental unit by
resolution if the application is ?led not later than 6 months following the date the building
permit is issued, the application shall be ?led before a building permit is issued for the new
construction or rehabilitation of the facility.? There is no other timing requirement in the Act.

- The of?cial FAQs for the NEZ program re-af?rm that the only ?provision in the application process?
that is ?time sensitive? is the application for the Certi?cate.?

0 Question 6 of the FAQs reads as follows: ?Are there provisions in the application process
which are time sensitive? Yes. An application for a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone WEZ)
Certificate must be ?led with the clerk of the LGU for a facility located in an established NEZ
before a building permit is issued for the new construction or rehabilitation of the facility

(emphasis added)?

0 Section of the Act then sets forth the statutory exception to this timing requirement with respect
to a quali?ed historic building. It provides that, ?An application may be ?led after a building permit is
issued only if 1 or more of the following apply. . . For a rehabilitated facility if all or a portion of the
rehabilitated facility is a quali?ed historic building.?

It The plain meaning of the Act provides that the rehabilitation of a quali?ed historic building is not
subject to the requirement that the Certi?cate application be submitted prior to issuance of the building
permit. Because there are no other statutory timing requirements, there is no timing requirement
applicable either to the Zone or Certi?cate process for the rehabilitation of a quali?ed historic

building? 3

 

2It is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that ?nothing is to be added to what the text states
0r reasonably implies? that a ?matter not covered is to be treated as not covered.? See Scalia and Garner,

Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts (2002), at p. 93.

3Section 4(1) of the Act requires a NEZ Zone to be established prior to submitting the Certi?cate
application. This creates a de facto timing requirement relative to the Zone where there is a timing
requirement applicable to the Certificate. But in the absence of a requirement applicable to the Certi?cate,
there is no requirement applicable to the Zone as a matter of law or fact.

RE: Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Corktown Lofts LLC
Property Address: 1720 W. Fort Street
Parcel ID: 08000048.

Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Of?cer, Of?ce of the Assessor, has reviewed the request for the pmposed Corktown
Lofts LLC Neighborhood Enterprise Zone, located in the West Side Industrial area in the City of Detroit. The owner?s
proposed plan is to rehabilitate the fourth floor and construct an additional floor to create 33 residential units in the
building the vacant historic building.

The rationale for creating NEZ projects under PA 147 of 1992, as amended, must be based on the anticipation of
market value added to the neighborhood upon completion of new construction and/or significant rehabilitation of
existing housing stock.

Corktown Lofts LLC overall project will be to rehabilitate the historic building and transform it into a mixed-use
development with an anticipated 2 floors (33 units) of residential apartments, 2 floors of office space, 2 ?oors of
retail space and below grade parking. The total building consists of a 4-story vacant retail building with 111,046
square feet of total above ground floor area. Corktown Lofts LLC proposes that the fourth floor of the building will
be rehabilitated to create 22 residential units and a new ?fth ?oor has been built above it with a plan to add 11
residential units. The current True Cash Value of the whole building is $2,054,600 and contains approximately .751
acres of land. The True Cash Value of this area would be expected to increase due to the rehabilitation and new
construction.

Per MCL 207.772 Sec.2 "Rehabilitated facility" means an existing structure or a portion of an existing structure
with a current true cash value of $30,000.00 or less per unit that has or will have as its primary purpose residential
housing, consisting of 1 to 8 units, the owner of which proposes improvements that if done by a licensed contractor
would cost in excess of $5,000.00 per owner-occupied unit or 50% of the true cash value, whichever is less, or
$7,500.00 per nonowner-occupied unit or 50% of the true cash value, whichever is less, or the owner proposes
improvements that would be done by the owner and mat a licensed contractor and the cost of the materials wouid
be in excess of $3,000.00 per owner-occupied unit or $4,500.00 per unit and will bring the
structure into conformance with minimum local building code standards for occupancy or improve the livability of
the units while meeting minimum local building code standards. Rehabilitated facility also includes an individual
condominium unit, in a structure with 1 or more condominium units that has as its primary purpose residential
housing, the owner of which proposes the above described improvements. Rehabilitated facility also includes
existing or proposed condominium units in a quali?ed historic building with 1 or more existing or proposed
condominium units. Rehabilitated facility does not include a facility rehabilitated with the proceeds of an insurance
policy for property or casualty loss. A qualified historic building may contain multiple rehabilitated facilities.

PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT 
TO: Veronica Farley, Housing and Revitalization
FROM: Esther Yang, Planning and Development
RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (PA 147) at 1702 W. Fort
Street
DATE: March 11, 2019
CC: Maurice Cox, Director, Planning and Development

In order to ensure consistency with the City's Master Plan of Policies, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public
Act 147 of 1992 (section 207.773), the Planning and Development Department?s Planning Division submits
the following interpretation for the proposed establishment of Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ). The
Petitioner is Corktown Loft, LLC

Location and Project Proposal: This specific petition (Petition 699) applies solely to the rehabilitation of the
fifth floor of the historic structure, located at 1702 Fort Street, to create 22 residential apartment units and
the associated parking in the basement of the rehabilitation structure; Two-thirds of the 13,908 square feet
parking in the basement level will support the 22 residential units.

The overall project seeks to rehabilitate a historic building and transform it into a mixed-use development
with office and retail space on the lower floors and an addition atop the historic structure to create
additional apartment units (11 units). The project will create retail and restaurant/cafe space on the first two
floors and one subgrade floor; office space on the middle two floors, 33 residential units on the upper two
floors, and 22 residential units on the fifth floor. The rehabilitation includes 13,908 square feet of parking in
the basement level to support the residential units and the 11 new facilities outside the scope of this
particular NEZ petition.

Existing Site Information: The current site is the home of the historic Edson, Moore and Company Building.
The building was construction in 1913, is located within the Corktown Historic District, and is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

Interpretation: The project will add to the stock of emerging businesses and strengthen residential loft
conversions already observed in the Corktown area. Additionally, the project is served by two bus lines and
the project could encourage additional bus stops and increased ridership along Fort Street.

RE: Request for the Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act (OPRA)
District at 3960 Third Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48201 for Selden AA Third Street

Garage, LLC

Honorable City Council:

Please accept this letter as a request to establish an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District
(OPRD) for the property located at 3960 Third Avenue. Detroit. Michigan 48201, which is
referred to herein as the "Property" and described on Attachment A. The Property will be
rehabilitated by the petitioner and current owner. Selden AA Third Street Garage. LLC.

Company and Project Synopsis

Selden AA Third Street Garage, LLC (the ?Developer") is an entity of 3Mission Partners. an Ann
Arbor-based real estate development company. The 3Mission team consists of Jon Carlson,
Greg Lobdell. and Robert Eisman and began in 1993. Principals, Jon and Greg, are both
University of Michigan graduates and have developed craft brewer, Northern United Brewing
Company. to its current sales level of over $20 Million annually. Together. they have also
developed over 200,000 square feet of mixed-use property in Michigan, many of which have
met the strict requirements to utilize both state and federal Historic Tax Credits. With Rob as the
latest addition to the team, 3Mission has gained a leader in managing finance and overall
business strategy. while taking the reins on 3Mission?s acquisition, property management, and
tenant relations. The team is primarily focused in Michigan with projects located in Grand
Rapids and Traverse City. An additional focus is brought to southeast Michigan with mixed-use
and infill projects located in Ann Arbor, Dexter, Ypsilanti. Royal Oak, and especially Detroit.

The proposed OPRD contains a single approximately 0.17 acre parcel at 3960 Third Avenue
and is bounded by third Avenue to the west. the property line and Rainer Court Apartments to
the north. and the alley to the east. and a vacant lot and cell phone tower to the south. The
OPRD is located in the Midtown neighborhood of Detroit with the District Detroit and the Q-line
located threequarters mile south east and one half mile east. respectively. The property is
occupied by a single-story former auto repair garage building with a partial basement totaling
approximately 7.?00 square feet. The building is currently being used for storage of residential
building materials. However, the building's roof and wall structure are subject to extreme
deterioration and water infiltration into the building. As such, the building currently remains

uninhabitable.

Request for Establishment of an Obsolete Preperty Rehabilitation District at
3960 Detroit Ml 48201
for Selden AA Third Street Garage, LLC

3960 Third Avenue will entail the rehabilitation of the current building into one retail/restaurant
tenant space. As part of the rehabilitation, the building will be stabilized with a new roof
membrane and flashing materials and replacement/repair of the exterior bricks. The brick will
also be repainted at the primary facade facing Third Avenue. New windows and doors will be
installed, including the existing clerestory windows at the roof, new aluminum storefront
systems, insulated overhead aluminum and glass roll-up doors. and folding windows for an
open, modern tenant space. On the interior, all existing walls will be removed. The interior
masonry walls, roof trusses, and concrete floor will be cleaned. The floor will be polished and
sealed while the roof trusses and walls will be painted or stained. The interior build-out also
includes framing of mechanical and electrical rooms as well as ADA compliant men's and
women?s restrooms. The rehabilitation also includes upgrades to the existing mechanical.
electrical, and plumbing systems and installation of fire protection systems.

The Necessity for Tax Relief

Substantial investment is necessary to rehabilitate the area into a viable, long-term
development. Additionally, the property currently contains a dilapidated and damaged building
that will require repair and selective demolition with the property rehabilitation. The overall
internal rate of return for the proposed development will be extremely low without the receipt of
the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District (and Certificate), and therefore, the development

would not be possible without it.

In order to secure this financing and future tenants, the operating costs of the proposed
renovations and redevelopment of the project need to be kept as low as possible (including

property taxes).

The proposed Development included within the request will result in approximately 30
construction jobs and approximately 60 full-time and part-time jobs created associated with the

proposed restaurant tenant.

PA 146 Request

A 12-year abatement is being requested.
Economic Advantages of the Rehabilitation

Upon completion, the Development will return an obsolete property to productive use and will
increase commercial density in an area on the fringe of investment in the Midtown
neighborhood, in particular those in close proximity to the John Lodge Freeway. Activation of
this property will spur further growth and act as a catalyst for future redevelopment of numerous
vacant and blighted properties along the Third Avenue corridor and the surrounding
neighborhoods and provide spinoff consumer spending in an area of Midtown that is currently
lacking redevelopment planning and investment.

The granting of the OPRA tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit
in the short-term or long-term. On a short term basis approximately 30 construction jobs will be
created. The Developer has a working relationship with Midtown Detroit, inc. and is familiar with
the resources available in order to facilitate hiring of Detroit residents during construction
activities. The chosen general contractor, Rok Constuction, is also Detroit-based and has

1?
(-

Request for Establishment of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District at
3960 Third Avenue, Detrolt Ml 48201
for Selden AA Third Street Garage, LLC

several Detroit-based contractors that they have used in the past and that they have requested
bids from to ensure Detroit-based contractors and workers benefit from the redevelopment. DZD
and the Skilled Trades Taskforce meetings will also be utilized to assist in this effort. In addition,
the Development team has a proven track record of hiring Detroit residents for other hospitality

businesses throughout the City of Detroit.

Upon successful redevelopment, the proposed Development will create approximately 60 full-
time and part?time jobs created associated with the proposed restaurant tenant. These new
jobs may generate increased income taxes for the City of Detroit.

Following expiration of the 12-year abatement the building will deliver a significant increase in
tax revenue. Over time. the successful redevelopment and cultural growth will have a city-wide

impact.
Closing

Selden AA Third Street Garage, LLC is a partnership between seasoned real estate
professionals with extensive experience in multi?family investments in Metro Detroit and

throughout the country.

The Development team has had a long-term relationship Midtown Detroit Inc. and have
garnered support for this project. In addition. members of the development team have reached
out to the Midtown community and nearby property and business owners regarding the new
ownership and anticipated improvements and garnered significantly positive feedback.

The team Is looking forward to pursuing this redevelopment and creating a community space on
the outskirts of Detroit's Midtown Neighborhood.

Detailed Project Description

General Description

The proposed Development is located along Third Avenue between Seiden Street and
Alexandrina Street in Midtown. northeast of the District Detroit. The property is loosely bounded
by Third Avenue to the west. the property line and Rainer Court Apartments to the north. and the
alloy to the east, and a vacant lot and cell phone tower to the south. The property consists of one
parcel. which is outlined in the map below.

 

The property is occupied by a single-story former
auto repair garage building with a partial
basement totaling approximately square
feet. The building is currently being used for
storage of residential building materials.
However. the building?s roof and wall structure
are subject to extreme deterioration and water
infiltration into the building. As such, the building

project currently consists of a complete building
rehabilitation to create a new retail/restaurant
space.

corresponding legal description can be found at the end of this attachment.

Description of Proposed Use

The proposed redevelopment will create additional commercial density in an area of Midtown that
has been behind the curve for investment and redevelopment. 3960 Third Avenue will entail the
rehabilitation of the current building into a single commercial tenant suite. The proposed
development will include 1700 square feet of retailirestaurant Space that includes a modern
tenant space that meets the space demands of today?s commercial needs. The tenant unit will
include an open floor plan with condensed mechanical and electrical spaces at the perimeter of
the tenant space. The space will also include new fixtures. finishes. and will be outfitted will new

storefront systems and glass overhead doors.

Successful redevelopment of this property will expand the successful investments and districts of
the Midtown area. This rehabilitation will create a piacernalting opportunity west of the Avenue
and Cass Corridors to bring vibrancy to a neighborhood that is currently characterized by blighted
buildings and vacant lots. Redevelopment will provide an opportunity to extend the revitalization
occurring throughout Midtown by providing additional foot traf?c. The property will include new
windows and glass overhead doors to create the feeling of bringing the outside in. The interior
floor plans will be left open to accent the building's bow truss and to create a modern restaurant

space that many Detroit tenants are craving.

Nature and Extent of the Rehabilitation

3960 Third Avenue will entail the rehabilitation of the current building into one retaiilrestaurant
tenant space. As part of the rehabilitation. the building will be stabilized with a new roof membrane
and flashing materials and replacementfrepair of the exterior bricks. The brick will also be
repainted at the primary facade facing Third Avenue. New windows and doors will be installed.
including the existing clerestory windows at the roof. new aluminum storefront systems. insulated
overhead aluminum and glass roll?up doors, and folding windows for an open. modern tenant
space. On the interior, all existing walls will be removed. The interior masonry walls. roof trusses.
and concrete floor will be cleaned. The floor will be polished and sealed while the roof trusses
and walls will be painted or stained. The interior build-out also includes framing of mechanical

The building has been utilized for only storage for over ?ve years and has been without running
heat at least as long. As a result. the building is in poor condition with neglected maintenance
items including a leaking roof and exterior brick work that is rapidly deteriorating. Multiple areas
of bricks require repair to prevent further falling and deterioration of the exterior wall system, in
addition to the water infiltration seen at the roof.

The Development will create additional commercial space for. and encourage, Detroiters to
populate these Spaces. These developments are necessary components crucial to attracting
resident and visitor interest along with investment in this fringe area of Midtown.

Selden AA Third Street Garage, LLC intends to apply for a 12 year real property tax abatement
under the provisions of an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act tax abatement.

Statement of Economic Advantages

The proposed Development will bring needed investment to an area on the fringe of development
in Midtown Detroit. The Development will increase commercial density in the blocks of Midtown
that are characterized by vacancy while bringing additional foot traffic into the neighborhood.
Activation of this property will spur further growth and infill development. and act as a catalyst for
future redevelopment of numerous vacant and blighted properties along the Third Avenue corridor
and the surrounding neighborhoods and provide spinoff consumer spending in Midtown.

The granting of the tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit in the
short-term or long-term. Upon successful redevelopment. the Development will generate
increased income taxes. through the new jobs that the project will create.

On a short term basis approximately 30 construction jobs will be created. The Developer has a
working relationship with Midtown Detroit. inc. and is familiar with the resources available in order
to facilitate hiring of Detroit residents during construction activities. The chosen general
contractor. Rok Construction. is also Detroit-based and has several Detroit-based contractors that
they have used in the past and that they have requested bids from to ensure Detroit-based
contractors and workers benefit from the redevelopment. D2D and the Skilled Trades Taskforce
meetings will also be utilized to assist in this effort. In addition. the development team has a proven
track record of hiring Detroit residents for other hospitality businesses throughout the City of
Detroit. including the nearby Jolly Pumpkin on Canfield Street that currently employees 70%

Detroit residents.

On a long-term basis the proposed redevelopment will create approximately 60 full-time and part-
time jobs created associated with the proposed restaurant tenant. Approximately 70%. or 42, of
tenant-created jobs are anticipated to be full-time. with 18 part-time jobs. or 9 full-time equivalent
jobs. The table below illustrates the resident tax impact the development will have following

completion.

Additionally, there will be other indirect benefits such as spin off spending in the City that will
contribute to the economic benefits produced by this investment. In January 2018. the Detroit
Economic Growth Corp. published a retail opportunity study. where great shifts in neighborhood
identify and character have been Illustrated. In order to break the cycle of disinvestment, the report
notes that vibrant and market-supported retail clusters can help to redefine neighborhood with an
activated street life. Investments in the community such as this that will have long-term effects
and provide sustainable principals will retain and foster local talent that is vital to securing the
neighborhood's and City's economic future.

Following expiration of the 12-year abatement the building will deliver a significant increase in tax
revenue. Over time, the successful redevelopment and cultural growth will have a city-wide

impact.

Re: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District
Addresses: 3960 Third Avenue
Parcel Numbers: 04003403.

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Of?cer, Of?ce of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District located at 3960 Third Avenue located in the Midtown area of the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Districts under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or signi?cant rehabilitation of existing
commercial property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not
necessarily generate additional market value.

Selden AA Third Street Garage LLC plans to convert the building at 3960 Third Avenue into one retail/restaurant tenant
space. The building is currently a 1 story vacant auto repair garage built in 1927 with 7,701 square feet of building area on
.172 acres of land. The building will be stabilized with a new roof, replacement/repair of exterior brick, new windows and
roll-up doors, fire protection system, and build-out for framing of mechanical and electrical rooms.

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete
and contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or
modify the property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically ef?cient condition. Rehabilitation also includes
major renovation and modi?cation including, but not necessarily limited to, the improvement of floor loads, correction of
de?cient or excessive height, new or improved ?xed building equipment, including heating, ventilation, and lighting,
reducing multistory facilities to 1 or 2 stories, adding additional stories to a facility or adding additional space on the same
floor level not to exceed 100% of the existing floor space on that floor level, improved structural support including
foundations, improved roof structure and cover, floor replacement, improved wall placement, improved exterior and
interior appearance of buildings, and other physical changes required to restore or change the obsolete property to an
economically efficient condition.

A field investigation indicated that the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District located at 3960 Third Avenue is
eligible as it pertains to the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act under PA. 146 of 2000, as amended.

The preposed OPRD contains a single approximately 0.085 acre parcel at 6432 Woodward
Avenue and is bounded by Woodward Avenue to the south. East Milwaukee Avenue to the
west, the East Milwaukee Avenue alley to the north. and the property line to the east. The
OPRD is located in the New Center neighborhood of Detroit with the Art Center District located
one mile southeast. The Line is also extremely assessible as there is a stop directly in front of
the building. The property is occupied by a 2-story commercial building totaling approximately
5,600 square feet. Purchased in May of 2018. the building primarily served as the Detroit

6432 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, MI 48202
for Mitten Capital, LLC

Hardware Company. Extensive repairs are required to bring the building up to electrical code
and meet the future use requirements.

The current building at 6432 Woodward will be renovated into a fine dining restaurant which will
feature modern. decor and exposed brick walls.

As part of the rehabilitation. the building will receive new utilities including electrical and
plumbing, new energy efficient heating. cooling and ventilation systems. a partial new roof. new
?ooring on the first floor. and foundation repairs in the basement. The structure will also be
brought up to code per ADA and fire requirements. which may include an ADA lift and ?re
suppression/alarm system if deemed required.

The Necessity for Tax Relief

Substantial investment is necessary to rehabilitate the property into a viable, long-term
development. The overall internal rate of return for the proposed development will be extremely
low without the receipt of the Obsolete PrOperty Rehabilitation District (and Certificate). and
therefore. the development would not be possible without it.

The costs associated with the rehabilitation require multiple capital sources including equity
contributed by Mitten Capital members as well as an interim construction loan. and upon
completion. a long-tenn loan product. In order to secure this financing and a future tenant. the
operating costs of the proposed renovations and redevelopment of the project need to be kept

as low as possible (including property taxes).

The proposed Development included within the request will result in approximately 15
construction jobs and 25 full-time equivalent (FTE) job associated with the ongoing
management and service for the proposed restaurant development.

PA 146 Request
A 12-year abatement is being requested.
Economic Advantages of the Rehabilitation

Upon completion. the Development will return an obsolete property to productive use and will
increase foot traf?c and density in an area that has suffered disinvestment over the years.
Activation of this property will spur further growth and acl as a catalyst for future redevelopment
of numerous vacant and blighted properties along Woodward Avenue. East Milwaukee Avenue.
and the surrounding neighborhoods and provide spinoff consumer spending.

The granting of the OPRA tax abatement will not result in any fewer taxes to the City of Detroit
in the short-term or long?term. On a short-term basis approximately 15 construction jobs will be
created. The Developer is making strides to hire Detroit-based contractors that they have used
and to ensure Detroit-based contractors and/or residents can benefit from the redeveIOpment.

Upon successful redevelopment. the proposed Devel0pment will create approximately 25 full-
time equivalent (FTE) job related to the management and service of the property. This new job
creation will generate increased income taxes forthe City of Detroit.

Following expiration of the 12-year abatement the building will deliver a significant increase in
tax revenue.
