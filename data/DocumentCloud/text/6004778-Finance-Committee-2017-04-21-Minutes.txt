Director Richardson-Lowry, seconded by Chairman Estrada, moved to accept the
minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting of March 24, 2017. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Charles Jones, Director of Strategic Sourcing and Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
With regard to request numbers 8 and 9, Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether a physician team or technical
consult was used to affirm the sole source award. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, responded
affirmatively; he stated that many of these types of matters come up through the Value Analysis process. That
process is predominantly composed of a physician clinical team, those who are using the pieces, along with a Value
Analysis person who lives within procurement and coordinates that team.

C. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Items
A. Report from Supply Chain Management
• Report of emergency purchases (Attachment #2)
Mr. Jones presented information on two (2) emergency purchases recently made.
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided additional information on the
emergency purchase with Texture Health Systems for a care coordination system for CountyCare. He stated that
this was not anticipated. CCHHS had an agreement with a prior vendor, but they changed direction and then could
no longer meet the needs. The administration had a little time to evaluate some other potential vendors, but given
the timeframe this was thought to be the best option.
Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the additional cost over what was originally contracted for with the
prior vendor. Mr. Elwell stated that, by the end of the three (3) years, the additional cost would probably be about
$250,000 to $1 million, for basically re-creating the system. Over time, it is expected to have the same cost
efficiency as the previous system; it has more capabilities and will be used in a broader way.
With regard to any recourses that CCHHS may have against the prior vendor, Mr. Elwell stated that the
administration is focused on getting the final payment to them so the administration can get the last of CCHHS’ data
back from them. Jeff McCutchan, Interim General Counsel, provided additional information. The prior vendor
was customizing and developing software to meet CCHHS’ particular needs, so it was an ongoing collaboration;
they did the services for which they were originally contracted, so CCHHS does owe them for the provision of those
services. It was the development of new things to meet CCHHS’ particular needs and goals that the prior vendor
thought they were going to do – they eventually determined that they either could not do it or did not desire to put
more money into creating it. Chairman Estrada inquired whether the work they did is useful to CCHHS going
forward. Mr. Elwell responded in the negative; however, he noted that it served a purpose for the year it was used.
With regard to the emergency purchase with Health Management Associates (HMA) for technical assistance and
consultation, Director Richardson-Lowry commented that this is a high buy-in, and inquired regarding the
emergency nature of the contract. Mr. Elwell responded that this contract is for assistance with writing the response
to the State’s Medicaid Managed Care Request for Proposals (RFP). The response will be more than 300 pages,
will be highly technical, and writing it requires a particular skill set. As to the emergency nature of the contract, the
administration did not initially believe that the State would require CCHHS to formally submit a response to the
RFP, as state statute contains a provision that essentially automatically qualifies CCHHS; when it was determined
that a formal response was going to be required, it had become a time-sensitive matter. Director Richardson-Lowry
reiterated her initial comments – she still thinks this is a high buy-in; she stated that there is a better way to do this that conversation will need to be held at a different time.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
• Report
• Metrics
• Financials through February 2017
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, presented the information contained in his report, which included
Financials through February 2017. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the subject of overtime, Mr. Akpan stated that the administration is going to have a
focused and detailed dive into that number. Dr. Shannon provided additional information. He stated that there
is an inexorable trend for that overtime spend, and it is disquietingly stable. Overtime expenses fall into three
(3) broad categories: 1) structurally related to holiday pay; 2) structurally related to pay under collective
bargaining agreements; and 3) presumably immediately controllable. The administration is trying to put detail
on what proportion of the overtime is in each of those categories. There is an upcoming meeting with
approximately 100 members of leadership/department directors on that subject. At the meeting, they will be
sharing information and data on overtime usage for each of their departments, talking about what is in their
control in making the schedules, and talking about expectations and accountability.

VI.

As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Estrada declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

has placed an emergency order. This memo serves as noti?cation, as
required in Section 2.8 of the Procurement Policy adopted by the Board
on April 9, 2009. The sponsor of the current system has changed directions and
is no longer making the system sustainable for our uses. This is requiring us to
move forward very quickly. This vendor was selected based on their ability to
quickly support the care coordination requirements of CountyCare, provide a
platform for non-CountyCare care coordination activity and support the
utilization management process for the system as required by the MCCN

agreement.
