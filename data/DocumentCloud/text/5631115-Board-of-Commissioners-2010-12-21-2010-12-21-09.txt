(“PDC”) services at Altgeld Gardens (IL2-007) (“Altgeld”), a Family Housing development. The

 0638 by an amount not-to-exceed $1,290,000.00 for the following: (1) the design of the Town
Center; and (2) the feasibility and pre-planning to convert Phases VI and V from Family Housing to
Senior and Intergenerational Housing.
Town Center – Part I - $1,260,000.00 NTE
Pursuant to Modification No. 2 issued in December 2009, H&R was required to perform preliminary
planning and design of concepts for a Town Center at Altgeld to address the social, welfare and
economic needs of the community. Currently, there are non-resident occupants and resident groups
utilizing dwelling units within Phase VI. The Part I portion of the Town Center plan is to provide
newly constructed space for these groups, and will result in the CHA bringing 40 dwelling units back
on line. Additionally, the Town Center will accommodate two (2) existing Department of Family and
Supportive Services (“DFSS”) providers that provide daycare services for the community and
Altgeld residents. DFSS is looking at the Altgeld Town Center as the permanent solution for their
day care facilities.
The breakdown of the proposed additional PDC services for the Town Center – Part I is as follows:

will include: (1) research of similar developments; (2) verification of land uses; (3) verification of
traffic patterns; (4) review of zoning requirements; and (4) program development. CCD and H&R
