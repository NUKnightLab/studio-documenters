Mr. Jordan presented the Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Purchase
Agreement with Great Lakes Water Authority and City of Detroit for Property Located at 11900
Freud and 11900 E. Jefferson.
As the Board is aware, in connection with the industrial land assembly project undertaken by the
City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) at the request of the City of Detroit
(the “City”), on February 27, 2019, (DBRA 19-02-262-08), the DBRA approved that certain
Memorandum of Understanding by and between FCA US LLC (“FCA”), DBRA and the City
relating to the following investment proposed by FCA in the city of Detroit (the “Project”):

 •

•

Construct a new assembly plant at the site of its current Mack Engine Plant located at
Mack and St. Jean, with an estimated investment of $1.6 billion and creation of
approximately 3,850 net new full-time jobs; and
Invest approximately $900 million at its Jefferson North Assembly Plant (“JNAP”), located
at Jefferson and St. Jean, creating approximately 1,100 net new full-time jobs.

In order to move forward with the Project, FCA needs approximately 200 acres of market-ready
land to support its operations at the 2 facilities for Project-related activities such as employee
parking, trailer marshalling, and finished vehicle storage. Thus, in the MOU, DBRA and the City
agreed, among other things, to execute binding agreements to deliver title to sufficient acreage
adjacent to or in close proximity to the Project site to meet FCA’s expansion needs.
DBRA staff identified the 14.45 acre parcel depicted on Exhibit A (the “Site”), which Site is owned
by the City and operated by Great Lakes Water Authority (“GLWA”) as a potential site for FCA’s
needs. The Site sites south of JNAP and adjacent to the Connor’s Creek power plant. At its
March 13, 2019 Board meeting, GLWA approved the sale of the Site to DBRA upon the terms
described in the Purchase Agreement attached as Exhibit B (the “Purchase Agreement”), a
summary of which follows:
Purchase Price: $1,000,000.00 with $1,000.00 deposit
Inspection Period: 180 days
Closing: Within 30 days following end of Inspection Period
Other: Final parcel configuration, road vacations, and access agreements to be
negotiated prior to closing
The purchase price and any diligence and other acquisition costs will be payable from funds made
available by the City to the DBRA. DBRA staff seeks the Board’s approval of the Purchase
Agreement and the DBRA’s actions required to be undertaken thereunder, as well as actions
reasonably required to conduct due diligence on and clear title to the Site.
Mr. George asked who currently owns the property and what the purchase price is. Mr. Jordan
stated that currently the City of Detroit and the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department own the
property and Great Lakes Water Authority (the “GLWA”) it via an agreement with the two entities
and the purchase price is $1,000,000.
Ms. Wilkins asked what the end use of the property will be and who will receive the property and
how. Mr. Jordan stated that the end use will be automobile storage and the property will be
transferred to FCA. Ms. Bridges stated that the land will be donated to FCA by the DBRA for the
expansion of the Mack Avenue Engine and Jefferson North Assembly Plants as the City’s
contribution towards the project.
Ms. McClain called for the question.
Mr. Walters stated that the question had been called and asked if there was support for a motion.
The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. George, seconded by Mr. Scott, DBRA Resolution Code 19-03-26211 was approved.

 Ms. Wilkins voted nay and stated that corporations such as FCA should have to pay for
land for projects of this type.
Ms. Navin stated that Ms. DeSantis submitted questions in writing via email and asked that
answers to the questions be read for the record at the meeting in her absence.

The answer is that the DBRA will be expending the funds
2. Is it the same entity that will be taking the deed?
The answer is that the DBRA will be taking deed to the property and hold it for a period
of time.
3. Are tax payer dollars being used to purchase the property or is FCA expending its own
money to buy the property?
The answer is that the DBRA is using funds provided to it by the City of Detroit to make
this purchase.
4. Is the City of Detroit buying the land and giving it to FCA as part of the subsidy being
required by FCA?
The answer is yes, the City and DBRA as part of its agreement to induce this project
to be located in the City of Detroit as part of the economic benefit of approximately
4,900 net new jobs, the City has agreed to assemble approximately 200 acres to be
utilized by FCA for its expanded operations. This land is part of the 200-acre land
assembly that the City has agreed to undertake.
5. Some residents of Beniteau Street, adjacent to the berms being relocated along St.
Jean Street, at neighborhood meetings have expressed concerns about the project.
Ms. Navin stated that the Mayor and Mayor’s staff have publicly stated that it is their
goal to minimize disruptions to the neighborhood caused by the construction or
operation of the expanded FCA facility.
Mr. Gonzalez asked what remaining properties are to be purchased as part of the project such as
