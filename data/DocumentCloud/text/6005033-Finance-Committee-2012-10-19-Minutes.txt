IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports through September 2012 (Attachment #5)
Dorothy Loving, System Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports through September
2012; also presented was information reflecting the general flow of transactions data to the Lawson System
(included in Attachment #5). Additionally, Ms. Loving introduced the team responsible for preparation of the
Financial Reports. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Committee discussed the following subjects: need for the enforcement of the CareLink Policy and
processing of all CareLink applications for outpatient services; the concerted effort of management to address
the matter of budget line items matching/reflecting the correct business units; and building the capacity to set
up a system of charge-backs, as part of the second phase of the reorganization to outpatient, inpatient and
shared services.
Director Michael, seconded by Director Ramirez, moved to accept the Financial Reports
through September 2012. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Update on implementation schedules and timelines for the following projects:
i. Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver (Attachment #6)
ii. Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) contract management / electronic exchange system
iii. Meaningful Use (Attachment #7)
Susan Greene, System Interim Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid
Waiver; included in the information was a spreadsheet with the division of responsibilities for the 1115 Waiver
Demonstration Project “CountyCare.”
Ms. Greene stated that the final terms and conditions are working their way through the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS) and are expected soon. The administration is pleased with what has been seen so
far, particularly as it relates to retroactive coverage. She indicated that staff is working hard to put preenrollment activities in place. The On Point system that is used for CareLink will also be used for the Waiver
applications. There will be an interface between On Point and the Illinois Department of Human Services
(DHS); applications will go into On Point and will be held there until Waiver approval and until they are
transmitted to DHS. It is believed that pre-enrollment activities will start the week of October 29th. 2,500
names have been received from the State of those general assistance recipients that were cut off on July 1st that
should be eligible for the Waiver; in addition, 4,000 people in CareLink have also been identified, so the
outreach activities will start by working the lists where the System is most likely to have success.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on implementation schedules and timelines for projects (continued)
The Chamberlin Edmonds and Associates (CEA) contract has been approved by the Board; staff is working
diligently with them on a schedule of how their staff will be deployed. One of the things that John Cookinham,
System Chief Financial Officer, and Helen Haynes, Associate General Counsel, have negotiated is that if a
Waiver application starts and it appears that the person is not going to be eligible for the Waiver, but it was
thought so when the application process first started, that application will be completed as a CareLink
application; Ms. Greene surmised that it is likely the number of those enrolled in CareLink may rise as a result.
Ms. Green stated that staff is working on a data-sharing agreement with DHS so the System can get the
remaining names of the general assistance recipients that lost coverage in July. The DHS online application
system will be ready on or around November 5th; assuming Waiver approval, formal applications will be
submitted to DHS on or around November 5th.
With regard to other Waiver activities, Ms. Green stated that the following is occurring: the third party
administrator selection process is ending; network building activities are underway; and the initial Waiver
hiring is well underway - the interview process has begun.
Chairman O’Donnell inquired regarding the strategy for community outreach. Ms. Greene responded that staff
is currently working on the strategy, particularly in trying to work out the roles of those who will be involved
(including the System, County, members of the community). Board Chairman Carvalho inquired as to the role
of the County in the outreach strategy. Dr. Raju responded that the System will be engaging a lot of
community forums for outreach activities; it may be helpful to coordinate for a combined effort.
The Committee discussed the subject of plans for enrollment of patients into the Waiver Project; incentives for
patients to enroll in the Waiver were discussed. Board Chairman Carvalho expressed concern with a plan that
assumes patients will voluntarily enroll without an incentive to do so. Dr. Raju stated that he would like to
design a program that has both incentives and disincentives; at the same time, he wants to make sure the
program will not dissuade patients from seeking care. He noted that when the administration is ready with that,
they will return to the Committee for its opinion and advice.
Ms. Besenhofer provided an update on the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. As referenced in Ms.
Loving’s materials regarding the general flow of transactions data to the Lawson System, she stated that this is
the foundation upon which they are building for the Supply Chain side. There are almost 30,000 items set up
in the system, which are tied to a general ledger account. Staff will have a much better handle on this when the
system goes live, to be able to have items charged appropriately, to be charged back to departments
appropriately, and to hold people accountable from a utilization perspective. The build phase is at
approximately 90%; the administration anticipates that testing will start next week. It is still on-track to go live
on January 7, 2013.
Ms. Besenhofer stated that the Lawson System is the foundation for the ERP system. What is being integrated
into the Lawson System is the GHX system, which is an electronic data interchange system. The System is
utilizing the GHX contract center; she noted that all of the System’s group purchasing organization (GPO)
contracts have already been uploaded electronically into the contract center. All of the System’s contracts will
be in this central repository within GHX, so that when a purchase order is issued, there will be a match on a
line item basis to make sure that there is the right tier levels of pricing, units of measure, etc. She added that,
with electronic invoicing, there will be that match again back to the purchase order, the receipt, and the
contract.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on implementation schedules and timelines for projects (continued)
Dr. Bala Hota, System Interim Chief Information Officer, provided an overview of the information presented
on Meaningful Use. The following subjects were included in the information: Current State of Electronic
Health Records (EHR); Functionality Added; Challenges; Meaningful Use Core Criteria; Meaningful Use
Menu Criteria; Stage 1 Meaningful Use; Eligible Hospital Incentive Payments-Medicare and Medicaid;
Eligible Provider Payment Schedules – Medicare and Medicaid; Meaningful Use Attestation at CCHHS –
Timelines and Barriers; and Stage 2 Meaningful Use.
Board Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding the compliance issues referenced in the information contained on
the last page of Dr. Hota’s presentation. Dr. Hota stated that one of the larger issues, which is mandatory,
relates to the patient summary. The reason why this is an issue is because, initially after the go-live, the
performance of the system was such that there was a long load time for that component of the record; in busy
clinics, it is very difficult to wait a minute for this component to load the summary view and print that for the
patient. That has been addressed to some degree. Now the question is - who is going to perform that step? In
every clinic, there are differences. In some clinics, a process has been developed where nursing staff has taken
on that responsibility; in other clinics, the providers have said that they want to do it, because it is their chance
to go over future visits. The system is reengineering the way they approach the patient, so it takes time. Dr.
Hota stated that reports have been produced starting this week that will be given to providers in clinics, so that
they have the opportunity to see where they are and how they can improve.
C. Committee Education – Overview of County/System funding (Attachment #8)
Randall Mark, System Director of Intergovernmental Affairs and Policy, and John Cookinham, System Chief
Financial Officer, reviewed the information provided regarding County / System funding. The following
subjects were included in the information: Background and History; Categories of Medicaid Reimbursements
to CCHHS; Medicaid and the Mechanics of Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT); Fee for Service Payments;
Benefits Improvement Protection Act (BIPA) Provision; Disproportionate Care (DSH) Funding; Section 1115
Waiver Reimbursement; and Health Reform, Risks and Opportunities Going Forward. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Ramirez inquired regarding the subject of parking revenues. Mr. Cookinham responded that what the
System records in its financial statements is somewhat dependent on how the County reallocates parking
dollars to the System. Additionally, Dr. Raju indicated that the System’s actual revenues from parking fees did
not reach the estimated amount. During the discussion of the subject, Mr. Cookinham indicated that there was
a possibility that the System would raise the parking fees at Provident Hospital, but that did not take place.
Board Chairman Carvalho inquired as to the reason for this. Mr. Cookinham stated that there was concern over
whether the System would have to bargain for this for the unionized employees. There was also concern over
whether increasing the parking fees at Provident Hospital would impact the utilization of the facility, because
patients are charged to park in that structure, as well.

V.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #9)
Mr. Cookinham presented his report, which included information on the following subjects related to the
Revenue Cycle Update: Accounts Receivable Target for Days of Revenue Outstanding; Current Days of
Accounts Receivable Outstanding; and CareLink Program as of September 2012. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.

V.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (continued)
With regard to the information presented on the CareLink Program, Board Chairman Carvalho inquired further
regarding the level of discount provided to patients residing outside of Cook County. For the out-of-County
residents who are entitled to a discount under State law, he asked whether that is that an entitlement for a discount
for anything the System chooses to provide them, or only for the services that they are entitled to pursuant to the
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor (EMTALA) Act. Mr. Cookinham stated that the answer to that
question recently changed; effective July 1st, if the patient has a hospital bill for a medically necessary service in
excess of $300, and their income is less than 200% of poverty, they get 100% discount for that service. Board
Chairman Carvalho suggested that this issue be added to a list of things to consider - what restrictions to persons
who are not residents of Cook County should the System have in place for non-urgent medical services? If the
System’s principal charge is providing care to residents of Cook County, is the System going to change its
policies with respect to people outside of the County more in the direction of only providing care that, for
example, EMTALA requires to be provided, not all care. Director Michael inquired whether the administration
has enough data on the out-of-County patients who are seeking care, to differentiate between the level of urgent
and non-urgent care provided; additionally, he asked whether the administration is able to calculate the cost of the
urgent and non-urgent care services for this population. Mr. Cookinham stated that he will follow up on the
subject and return with more information1.
On the subject of the information received regarding enrollment efforts for Medicaid and CareLink, Board
Chairman Carvalho requested that the information be augmented to track how the System is getting people into
Medicaid; also what is needed is the number of people who declined to go through the process (the denominator),
or how many people could have gone through the process if the function had been fully staffed and had made it
available.

VI. Adjourn

7 lowest quali?ed bidder meeting all speci?cations of the bid to provide temporary staf?ng in Cardiology. A major

component Of length of stay for both medical and surgical patients is the waiting period for cardiology tests. In order

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION: 
Echocardiography is provided six days a week. with a ten-hour work day along with on-0all responsibility for Sundays 
and Holidays. The technicians are also cross-trained in nuclear cardiology. The staf?ng agency technician allows us I

patient. We were utilizing substantial overtime by scheduling the technician on Saturday. Utilizing the temporary 
staf?ng echocardiographer enables us to schedule every Saturday, allowing us to maintain a 7 day wait-time for out-
patients and same day for in-patients. This staf?ng resource is essential to meet the standard Of care. We are 5
requesting additional funds for the remainder of the contract to assist us through the process Of hiring an additional
echocardiographer.

amount of $435,880.00. A staffing shortage brought about by retirements and vacant positions created the need to
utilize temporary staffing in the laboratory. In addition, due to the implementation of the McKesson Pharmacy system
and some unanticipated backlogs, there was a request to the Board for an amendment for temporary Pharmacy
resources that was approved by the Cook County Health Hospitals System Board on 09/28/2012 to increase the
contract in the amount of $409,280.00.

 
 
      
    
      
 
   
 

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This request is for temporary staffing for the Human Resources Department. The clerical staffing shortage in Human
Resources has made this request necessary as there is a need for 6 temporary staff members for a period of six

months. This request will result in an increase of the contract total spend of $957,480.00.

 
 
      
  
 
 

TERMS OF REQUEST:
This request is to increase contract number H11-73-101 in the amount of $1 12,320.00 to allow for additional services

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended September 30, 2012. This discussion
focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current
month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of
the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide primary,
intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to
pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy
activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the ten months with overall
revenue of $758,981 and overall expenses was $767,926.
Net Patient revenue for the ten months was $494,856.
5
Page 43 of 125

 Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $6,714. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2011, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
September-2012 reduced by 24 to 130 days. The 18 day decrease in this figure, as
compared to August-2012 figure, is due largely to the one-time or first-time occurrence
of the following factors:




Movement of accounts with undeliverable addresses to the collection agency;
Correction of pharmacy charging issues; and
Transition of patients previously covered under the LOL program to the Carelink
program.

This month, CCHHS revised processes with the eligibility vendor and performed
accounts receivable maintenance and clean-up that identified additional patient accounts
that should either be Carelink or collection agency accounts. This accounts for the large
change in balances during September-2012. This also was the primary reason for the
reduction in days of revenue outstanding.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts fell by $33.912M (9.6%) as compared to the November-2011
balance and also fell by $40.882M (11.3%) as compared to the prior month’s balance.
This figure has declined in seven (7) out of the last eight (8) months. The overall decline
6
Page 44 of 125

 in this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the collection
process.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of September-2012 decreased
by $10.890M (51.4%) as compared the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is less
than the previous month’s balance by $6.252M (37.8%) as well. This indicates that more
inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual cash
collections.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of September-2012 decreased by $22.894M (11.9%)
as compared to the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is less than the previous
month’s balance by $31.953M (15.8%).
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that more accounts are being removed from
active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $1.464M (6.6%) by the end of
September-2012, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2011.
This month’s balance decreased by $5.198M (19.9%). More outpatient accounts are
moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month. The reduction of
internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a decline in the unbilled
accounts receivable.
7
Page 45 of 125

 The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of September-2012 fell by $11.018M
(6.8%) over the balance as of November 30, 2011. This figure is smaller than the
previous month’s balance by $8.929M (5.6%).
The reduction in this figure, as compared to the prior month’s balance, indicates a greater
number of Out-Patient accounts had their collection and write-off related activities
completed.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
Carelink Program Activities (Charity Care)
The volume and dollar amounts written-off to charity care are as follows:

In-Patient
Out-Patient

Number of Accounts for
August-2012

Operating Expenses at the end of ten months was $767.926M broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $393.943M
Benefits - $119.535M
Supplies - $79.369M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $112.640M
Depreciation - $28.027M
Utilities - $8.937M
Insurance - $25.476M

Page 46 of 125

 Nonoperating Revenue was $257.411M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
sales tax in the amount of $101.503M and property tax in the amount of $67.280M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 08/15/2012 - 09/12/2012 .
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" total is a payment to the state for supplemental workers
hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Upper Payment Limit Revision is spread over 11 months, beginning Jan-2012, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received.
The "Medicaid Retroactive Payment" was budgeted all at SHCC.

- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- Oak Forest Specialty Health Center is considered to be a clinic and not an emergency room; as such, it does not have emergency room elopes.

Cook County Health Hospitals System

Background and History

 

 

0 Prior to Medicare and Medicaid, county municipal governments often
bore primary responsibility for medical care for the poor;

0 Cook County began provision of medical care in the mid-19th century;

0 Prior to Medicare and Medicaid federal legislation, in the early 1960?s,
Cook County Hospital had more than 3,000 beds;

0 Recognizing the traditional role of municipal providers, the original
Medicaid statute provides for up to 60% of a State?s funds for federal
match can originate as ?local contributions? from local governmental
entities;

Cook oumy Health Hospitals System

Medicaid and Concepts Mechanics

 

 

0 Traditionally, Medicaid is ?nanced by State ?nancial contributions or
expenditures that then qualify for ?Federal Financial Participation? 
according to the relevant Federal Matching Assistance Percentage 

- Leveraging the opportunity for ?local contributions? to qualify for FF P, since
the ?rst IGA in 1991, Cook County has itself ?nanced Medicaid payments from
the Illinois Medicaid Agency (now HFS, the Department of Healthcare and
Family Services);

0 Through a series of successor agreements and amendments, virtually all
Medicaid reimbursements to the System have been derived according to the
terms of existing intergovernmental agreements;

0 Terms of these agreements, and changes thereto, are incorporated into the
State Medicaid Plan which is subject to approval by federal authorities, now
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

Medicaid and Concepts Mechanics (cont?d)

 

Cook County ?nances its own Medicaid payments:

0 Because ?nances its own payments, the State of Illinois
incurs no net cost to the general _R_evenue Eund for Medicaid
patients treated by the System;

0 In FY2012, Cook County will provide more than in ?local
contributions? to draw down Medicaid payments for services,
BIPA payments, and DSH payments;

0 These transfers are executed by Cook County from its corporate
funds;

 Revenue Cycle Update
 Under the 1115 Waiver the System earns it revenue based on the number of patients

enrolled under the Waiver program times the months each member is enrolled. This is a
departure
p
from the current revenue cycle
y under the Medicaid pprogram.
g

 The present Medicaid revenue cycle is based on the ability to bill and collect for services.

The more claims that are billed the more money is potentially collected.

 Under the 1115 Waiver as more services are billed there will not be an increase in

patient service revenue.

 Under the 1115 Waiver the successful billing of patient services serves a different, but

very important function. The patient bills provide a way to establish what was provided
to a patient. From the services provided to a patient it is possible to estimate the cost of
those services.

 The 1115 Waiver requires a reconciliation of the cost of Waiver program and the

capitation revenue. The patient bills are a component of that reconciliation.



In fiscal 2013 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System will still be required to bill and collect for all
insured patients that are not covered by the Waiver as well as patients covered in the Waiver program.



Even though
E
h h there
h are now going
i to bbe a new population
l i off patients
i
coveredd bby the
h Waiver
W i or traditional
di i l
insurance there will continue to be patients that are not eligible for third party coverage.



Some of the uncovered patients will be self pay and they will be provided a discount to help pay their
health care bills through the Illinois Uninsured Hospital Discount Act or if they are Cook County
Residents they will be provided a discount if they apply for CareLink. These patients must be willing to
document their income and family size to obtain a discount.



The success of the System in fiscal 2013 depends on the System’s
System s success in improving its revenue cycle.
There has been a great deal of progress in 2012 to improve the revenue cycle and this progress needs to
continue in 2013.



There are some measures to estimate the success of a revenue cycle.
y
One measure of efficiencyy is that of
average days of revenue outstanding. This measure requires that the average daily revenue is determined
for a rolling three month period. The average daily revenue is then divided into the outstanding accounts
receivable. The result is the average days of revenue that is outstanding at that point in time. It will vary
with the payer mix of each institution.



Each of the third party payers processes bills for services in a different time frame. Some payers take as
little as 15 days and others may take an average of 60 days.

 Payer mix can determined in a variety of ways.
 Payer mix can be based on gross charges at the time of registration, the

volume of services, or cash collections.

 CCHHS provides a variety of forms of payer mix information. There

are several adjustments
j
that are made to all of the initial data sets
collected. The adjustments include grouping similar payer sources
together and making an estimate of the number of Medicaid
applications
pp
that will be successfullyy approved.
pp

 The use of measures of payer mix is valuable to demonstrate why
8

actual performance is different than a budget or establish that there has
been a change in the patients served by the organization.

 The System reports monthly its admissions by payer, patient days, and

adjusted patient days.

 There are many more industry measures that can be used to report on

operations. There will need to be additional measures of utilization to
measure success under the 1115 Waiver program.
p g

 In a managed care environment where the System receives capitation it is

important to control costs and the utilization of resources.

 Adjusted patient days are a measure developed by the American Hospital

Association to measure activity using a common denominator for inpatient
andd outpatient activity.

 Adjusted patient days can be used to measure overall volume or the

consumption
i off resources on a per unit
i basis.
