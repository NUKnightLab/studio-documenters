·1· · · · · · · · ·This is a new food business
·2· incubator project at the corner of Lake and Kedzie
·3· in East Garfield Park.· And the intent is to lower
·4· the barriers to entry for small entrepreneurs in
·5· the food and beverage sector, which has been noted
·6· in various economic development efforts for the
·7· City of Chicago as a growth sector for the region
·8· and then also a provider of business ownership
·9· opportunity for historically disadvantaged folks as
10· well as employment opportunity for hard-to-employ
11· populations.
12· · · · · · · · ·It is a collaborative effort between
13· ICNC, the Industrial Council of Nearwest Chicago,
14· which is already the operator of a large incubator
15· and old incubator facility in the Kinzie Industrial
16· Corridor, Accion Chicago, which is a prolific micro
17· lender for small businesses, it's also a CDFI, and
18· then IFF is the development manager assisting with
19· initial land acquisition for the non-City-owned
20· parcels and then also the execution of the
21· development process.
22· · · · · · · · ·Again, the project location is Lake
23· and Kedzie.· So it's a very transit-oriented
24· project immediately adjacent to the Kedzie stop on

·1· the CTA's Green Line.· It's a very distressed
·2· census tract.· The poverty rate is over 30 percent.
·3· The median family income is just over 40 percent as
·4· the regional median income.· And the unemployment
·5· rate is two and a half times the national average.
·6· So highly distressed and highly qualified for New
·7· Markets Tax Credit investment.
·8· · · · · · · · ·So a bit more on the project.· So
·9· it's being built as a multi-tenant space.· First of
10· all, Accion is going to move its main offices from
11· downtown to the facility, which will be helpful in
12· terms of generating activity in the neighborhood,
13· but also as a service provider and a potential
14· provider of capital for the businesses in the
15· facility.· And that's all very intentional.
16· · · · · · · · ·There are 56 private rentable
17· kitchen spaces with some flexibility.· So the
18· tenants can rent one space, two spaces; they can
19· move some of the walls around to accommodate larger
20· footprints if needed.· But 56 individual spaces
21· that are highly built out.· And part of the premise
22· here is it's very expensive and complex to get the
23· certifications and licenses necessary to operate a
24· food business legally.· And so the Hatchery is

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 7

·1· really trying to be as turnkey as possible in terms
·2· of the build-out and at least the building- and
·3· facility-related certifications so that tenants
·4· don't have to worry about that.
·5· · · · · · · · ·It also has shared facilities such
·6· as cold and dry storage, warehousing, and loading,
·7· meeting and conference space.· And then there's
·8· also community space such as an outdoor market
·9· which will host the East Garfield farmers market,
10· but also provide community gathering spaces for the
11· non-tenants and members of the Hatchery since it is
12· also a service provider to the food community more
13· broadly.· That also portends to congregate and
14· share ideas.
15· · · · · · · · ·It's a $30.6 million overall
16· project.· 67,000 square feet of new construction.
17· · · · · · · · ·In terms of the community impacts.
18· So being that the tenants are not pre-leasing, the
19· projection from the project sponsor, but they're
20· projecting about 248 newly created FTE jobs.· Those
21· are within the small business tenant spaces.· So
22· they're anticipating two to five FTEs per tenant,
23· many of whom will be hired as the businesses grow
24· on site.· And then 40 Accion employees will

·1· relocate as well to the facility.
·2· · · · · · · · ·As I mentioned, the project also
·3· serves folks that aren't actually tenants.· There's
·4· actually a membership group called the Hatchery
·5· that already operates for small food entrepreneurs
·6· throughout the city at this point.· And so the
·7· thought is about 75 food businesses would be
·8· members of that overlapping fairly heavily with the
·9· tenant base, but also having some members that are
10· outside the walls, if you will.
11· · · · · · · · ·In terms of community impact.· So
12· the City's been working diligently in negotiating
13· the redevelopment agreement on the project.· And so
14· there's actually a community benefits attachment to
15· the redevelopment agreement that specifies in
16· pretty good detail that there will be a community
17· advisory committee to the project ongoing, that
18· there will be space dedicated to the Garfield Park
19· Neighborhood Market outside the Hatchery space as
20· well as interior storage space to help facilitate
21· the operations of the market.
22· · · · · · · · ·Technical assistance to neighborhood
23· entrepreneurs.· Entrepreneurship classes for those
24· that are thinking about forming a food business.

·1· Discounted membership to businesses that are
·2· located within a defined geographic area; that is
·3· generally kind of the lower income census tract
·4· surrounding the Hatchery and other community
·5· outreach efforts.
·6· · · · · · · · ·In terms of the transaction details,
·7· this is a -- kind of a it-takes-a-village type of
·8· financing.· There's, let's see, five CDEs involved
·9· in the transaction, including Chicago Development
10· Fund pending Board action today.
11· · · · · · · · ·Then also two layers of lenders.
12· There's the senior lender group led by MB Financial,
13· which is comprised of banks, and then a junior
14· lender group, which is led by IFF, but also
15· includes CCLF and some other CDFI lenders.· And
16· then the Walton Family Foundation is also providing
17· a layer of debt that is subordinate to the CDFI
18· layer.· So three types of traditional debt.· Some
19· fundraising from a couple of foundations and
20· corporations.· The City is providing about 7.2
21· million of TIF assistance which PNC Bank will
22· bridge.
23· · · · · · · · ·And so the proposed allocation
24· through CDF is 5 million out of a total of 30

·1· million.· The participants there are CRF, which is
·2· a national community development financial
·3· institution out of Minneapolis, First Pathway,
·4· which is a for-profit EB5 regional center and
·5· economic development organization based in
·6· Milwaukee, but also serving Illinois, Partners
·7· for the Common Good, which is a CDFI based in
·8· Washington, D.C.· Then PNC Bank itself as a CDE,
·9· and they will put in 2.5 million of allocation.
10· And then PNC would serve as the overall tax credit
11· investor.
12· · · · · · · · ·I know you got a lot of information
13· very quickly.· But that's the base presentation.
14· We'll pause for questions or calls from the Board.

·5· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Okay.
·6· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah.· Summarizing what was in
·7· the packet.
·8· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Yeah.· But some of the things
·9· like that are in here are helpful going forward.
10· Like the operating financials were not in the
11· description -- in the project description.· So
12· it's hard to look at sources and uses without the
13· support of operating financials.
14· · · · MR. SMITH:· It will be attached in the
15· future.
16· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· That would be helpful.· Thank
17· you.
18· · · · MR. LEÓN:· I have a question on the sources.
19· Where is the $5 million from the CDF?
20· · · · MR. SMITH:· So if you look in the Source and
21· Use table, the NMTC B Note of just over 9 million,
22· that is the combined subsidy resulting from all
23· five CDEs.· And so CDF's piece of that is maybe a
24· million 5 or so out of the 9.

·2· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· And that proposes the full

10· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah.· So, for example, if the
11· contractor were to come back and say, Oh, we just
12· saved $2 million on the guaranteed max -13· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Right.
14· · · · MR. SMITH:· -- we might be able to pull

16· technically it's an up to 5 million approval.
17· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Right.
18· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· Anyone else?· Any questions?

·2· · · · · · · · ·All in favor.
·3· · · · · · · · · · · (Chorus of ayes.)
·4· · · · · · · · ·Any opposed?
·5· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
·6· · · · · · · · ·In the opinion of the Chair, the
·7· ayes have it.
·8· · · · · · · · ·The next matter is the consideration
·9· of the Flex-N-Gate project.· Tony Smith will
10· introduce this project.
11· · · · MR. SMITH:· So this project is an auto
12· components manufacturer which will be doing a new
13· facility in Chicago as a tenant in an existing
14· building in the South Deering neighborhood on the
15· Far South Side; so right near the Ford plant, down
16· in that part of the city.
17· · · · · · · · ·So Flex-N-Gate Corporation is an
18· automotive equipment supplier that's headquartered
19· in Urbana, but it is the 10th largest automotive
20· supplier in North America and 38th largest
21· worldwide.
22· · · · · · · · ·So they make various components for
23· Ford, GM, and a couple other automakers, including
24· bumpers, mechanical, chassis, structural assemblies,

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 14

·1· et cetera.
·2· · · · · · · · ·This would be an operating business
·3· New Markets transaction, which is something that
·4· CDF has only done once before with the Method
·5· projects.· Our CDF funded some equipment and
·6· working capital.· I think that's -- this is good
·7· tentatively because U.S. Treasury likes to call
·8· upon CDEs to do not just real estate financings,
·9· but also working capital and equipment if their
10· mission is conducive to that.· And so CDF being an
11· industrial-focused lender, it makes sense.
12· · · · · · · · ·The project location, as I
13· mentioned, Far South Side.· So 126th between
14· Torrence and Carondelet, if I'm saying that right,
15· in the 10th Ward.· So also a very highly distressed
16· census tract with a poverty rate of just under 36
17· percent and a median family income of just under 50
18· percent of the regional figure.
19· · · · · · · · ·So in terms of what's actually being
20· built and funded.· So Flex-N-Gate plans to invest
21· about $20.8 million on retrofit of an existing
22· building that they're leasing plus installation of
23· substantial new equipment that's customized for the
24· build and the specific equipment for the specific

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 15

·1· vehicle that Ford wants them to assist with.
·2· · · · · · · · ·So the proposed allocation is 15
·3· million that would assist with the financing of
·4· this $20.8 million spend.
·5· · · · · · · · ·They're leasing 290,000 square feet
·6· from the facility.· They have a six-year lease with
·7· two five-year extension options.· They have to be
·8· somewhat flexible because if Ford can't move the
·9· vehicle in question or reduces their demand, that
10· may impact Flex-N-Gate's ability or desire to
11· remain in the facility long term.
12· · · · · · · · ·In terms of the community impact.
13· So these are all new jobs to Chicago.· About 325
14· permanent, full-time positions are projected by the
15· company earning an overall average annual wage of
16· about $39,000 a year.
17· · · · · · · · ·Like many of the manufacturing
18· projects we've looked at over the years, it's a
19· good blend between quality and accessibility with
20· these jobs.· So many of the jobs, 87 percent to be
21· precise, don't require more than a high school
22· diploma as a qualification.· The average hourly
23· wage for those accessible positions is 16.80 an
24· hour plus benefits, and they're all full-time

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 16

·1· positions.· And there will be some additional
·2· training assistance through state funds as well as
·3· some federal funds passing through the city.· So a
·4· million 5 is the anticipated training assistance
·5· there.
·6· · · · · · · · ·Let's see.· In terms of transaction
·7· details.· So, as I mentioned, 15.0 million
·8· allocations from CDF.· So that would result in a
·9· little bit north of $4 million of subsidies to
10· Flex-N-Gate.· This was part of a discussion by the
11· company about whether they wanted to locate in
12· Chicago.· They were -- they had several other
13· options that were within a four-hour radius of the
14· Ford site, which essentially is a Ford requirement
15· imposed on Flex-N-Gate.
16· · · · · · · · ·So the ability to provide New
17· Markets is somewhat unique to Chicago.· Some of the
18· sites in Indiana they were looking at, that was not
19· available.· So it was a key piece of attracting
20· them to potentially do the project here.
21· · · · · · · · ·New Markets investor is proposed to
22· be JP Morgan Chase.· And a fairly fast-moving
23· project.· Flex-N-Gate is looking to try to close in
24· Q1 of 2018 and actually spend the bulk of the

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 17

·1· dollars in the six months or so following that.
·2· · · · · · · · ·The capital in this case is much
·3· simpler than the Hatchery.· Flex-N-Gate has
·4· existing corporate credit facilities that they can
·5· pull down sufficient funds to serve as the leverage
·6· for the New Markets transaction.· So potentially
·7· it's Flex-N-Gate's capital that they're borrowing
·8· from a consortium of banks plus the New Markets
·9· subsidy.· And the spend, in turn, is paying
10· primarily for equipment purchase and installation
11· and upgrades to the facility such as cranes.
12· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· Any questions from the
13· members?
14· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Yeah.· So when you say "close,"
15· they're looking to close -- they've already signed
16· their lease, right?· So what's the thing that's -17· what's the close that's imminent?
18· · · · MR. SMITH:· The financial close.
19· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Right.· And what's the
20· financial close of the New Markets Tax?· Because
21· the only other sort of financing there is they're
22· giving a loan to themselves and they're putting
23· equity in, right?
24· · · · MR. SMITH:· So they would fund their entire

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 18

·1· contribution to the project upfront, then flow
·2· through the New Markets structure.· So after
·3· closing has been disbursed from the account that's
·4· jointly controlled by the CDF and Chase and there's
·5· draws, after they spend the funds to build it.
·6· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· But there's not some big
·7· financial transaction; it's the New Markets Tax
·8· Credit and them loaning themselves and putting cash
·9· in?
10· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.· The sources that they'll
11· use, or their capital, are actually already in
12· place.· They have a corporate credit facility, yes.
13· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· But JP Morgan -- sorry.
14· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Go ahead.
15· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· JP Morgan funds the -16· basically is the purchaser of the credits -17· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.
18· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· -- and will fund the cash
19· that's -- right.· So the JP Morgan funds with our
20· credits and then Flex-N-Gate money.
21· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yep.· All that comes in
22· simultaneously.
23· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· It's an interesting financial
24· operating projection where they're showing

Page 19

·1· substantially less profit in year five than year
·2· one.· Do we know why that is?· So like most
·3· projections you see, it goes the other direction.
·4· · · · MR. SMITH:· Right.· I think what they're
·5· doing here, they don't want to assume that there's
·6· going to be steady, kind of long-term demand for
·7· this vehicle.· I think the pattern is that there's
·8· kind of strong sales initially when a new vehicle
·9· is rolled out, and then it's kind of a wild card as
10· to what the sustained sales would be.· So they're
11· anticipating sort of a flattening of the financials
12· for it.
13· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Right.· And then they're
14· getting $4 million of -15· · · · MR. SMITH:· Net subsidy in the New Markets.
16· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· No.· $4 million of payroll tax
17· credits and $1-1/2 million of training.
18· · · · · · · · ·What's the -- do we know what the
19· form of that training might -- so another $5-1/2
20· million basically of subsidies.· The payroll tax
21· credit I think I understand.· The training, is that
22· reimbursement for incremental training that they
23· provide, or is it just sort of a subsidy for
24· employees' first six months on the job?· How does

·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· I actually don't have the kind of
·3· details.· We've tried to get more on that from the
·4· state.
·5· · · · · · · · ·I don't know, Aarti, if you have
·6· any -·7· · · · MS. KOTAK:· Yeah.· It comes from the state,
·8· and they've got -- I think they may have received
·9· federal money that came through in America's
10· Promise grant.· So it's a passthrough.
11· · · · · · · · ·But I don't know that the -- I don't
12· know what the terms of that are, whether it's -13· whether it's reimbursement -- I'm assuming it is
14· because that's how we do it.· But that's an
15· assumption.· So whether it's reimbursement or
16· whether it's OJT or specific skill-based training.
17· But it is running through both the state and then
18· the Calumet Area Industrial Commission as the
19· charge partner that is in receipt -- the Calumet
20· Area Industrial Commission and IMEC are the two
21· local partners on the ground through whom the grant
22· is working is my understanding of it.
23· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· So is that, to our knowledge,
24· the total amount of other subsidy independent of

·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.
·3· · · · MR. SUMMERS:· Okay.
·4· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· Other questions?
·5· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
·6· · · · · · · · ·Tony, can you explain a little
·7· bit -- you began this matter by saying this is
·8· an operating and equipment New Market Tax Credits
·9· versus real estate.
10· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.
11· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· One, what's -- tell me a
12· little bit what the difference is, because this
13· seems only like it's equipment, there's no
14· operating component, unless I -- you know, maybe
15· explain that.
16· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So Treasury defines
17· essentially two types of potential New Markets
18· borrowers, real estate "qualitees" they're called
19· and non real estate borrowers.· And so it relates
20· to what is the primary business activity of your
21· borrower and what's the primary use of proceeds.
22· · · · · · · · ·So CDEs, when they apply for tax
23· credit allocation, have to say what their primary
24· line of business is going to be, and, if they

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 22

·1· choose to, they can make specific commitments to a
·2· certain percentage of their financing would, for
·3· example, go to non real estate uses.· I mean,
·4· that's actually viewed as sort of a positive factor
·5· in trying to win allocation if you say you're going
·6· to do some operating business or non real estate
·7· financing; so if you spend the dollars on anything
·8· that is not constructing or renovating or acquiring
·9· a real property asset.
10· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· Like the Hatchery.
11· · · · MR. SMITH:· Like the Hatchery.· If you spend
12· it on anything else, it's viewed as an operating
13· business transaction.· In this case, all the
14· dollars are going to hard investments.· But
15· theoretically you could also fund working capital
16· as well.· And CDF, when it funded the Method
17· transaction, for example, it did about two-thirds
18· equipment, one-third working capital for the
19· preopening period.
20· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· And how does the -- I get
21· the real estate components and the equipment
22· components.· How does the working capital -- how
23· does the company use the proceeds for working
24· capital?· Do they just put it into their -- it just

·1· goes right into their financials and -·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.
·3· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· -- just bring other
·4· working capital to the table at the same time?
·5· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah.· I mean, legally you can
·6· spend New Markets proceeds on any legitimate
·7· business purpose of the borrower.· So operational
·8· spend would count for that.· In this case, it's
·9· going to be hard asset spending, but in theory -10· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· Sure.· I understand the
11· universe of options.
12· · · · MR. LEÓN:· But how does CDF keep track of
13· that, whether it goes for the operations or
14· equipment?
15· · · · MR. SMITH:· So in this case it'll be pretty
16· simple.· There'll be a disbursement account from
17· which Flex-N-Gate can't requisition fund unless
18· they have a specific item that they are spending
19· the money on.· So they'll have an invoice from an
20· equipment vendor or installer or evidence that
21· they've already paid that invoice.· And so the
22· release of funds would only be subject to seeing
23· those pieces of evidence.

·5· flexible.· I mean, if one of those deals comes
·6· along, we would want to talk a bit in a meeting
·7· like this about how to regulate and track that

·9· point.
10· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· I understand.· I just want
11· to educate myself.
12· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yeah.· There, I mean, it's more
13· common to actually advance some funds.· Like, let's
14· say, you're giving somebody 3 million of working
15· capital.· You'd give them like, let's say, a
16· million at closing, and then they go spend that and
17· come back and tell you exactly what they spent it
18· on.· And we project how they're going to spend the

20· · · · MR. LEÓN:· And how much time do they have to

16· Center project.
17· · · · · · · · ·Tony Smith.
18· · · · MR. SMITH:· All right.· So at our last
19· meeting, this Board approved allocation for a large
20· health center project with Esperanza Health Centers
21· at the southwest corner of 47th and California in
22· Brighton Park.
23· · · · · · · · ·That prior project had Mount Sinai
24· Hospital as a key partner, and the facility was

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 26

·1· going to be larger and essentially was a joint
·2· facility of Esperanza and Sinai.· So we wanted to
·3· come back just to change a, you know, moderately
·4· important scope of the project.· Sinai has been
·5· unable to raise the capital they needed to
·6· contribute to the project, which was about 7-1/2
·7· million of debt that they were attempting to take
·8· on and then provide through the New Markets
·9· structure to fund a piece of the building.· And
10· Sinai cannot raise that capital, at least not
11· within the timeframe that Esperanza needs to move
12· forward.
13· · · · · · · · ·So Esperanza kind of swallowed hard
14· and reconfigured the project.· So still in the same
15· location.· It's a site that Esperanza bought over -16· about a year ago at this point.· And at this point
17· it would be a large community health center with
18· Esperanza Health Centers being the owner and
19· operator and then a small space for Mujeres Latinas
20· and Accion, which is a social service provider that
21· works together with Esperanza quite a bit on
22· various wraparound services for the same population
23· that Esperanza serves.
24· · · · · · · · ·So the matter before you today is

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 27

·1· to just provide an update and seek essentially the
·2· Board's blessing to continue to participate in the
·3· revised transaction because it still is quite
·4· large, quite impactful despite the loss of the
·5· Sinai piece.
·6· · · · · · · · ·So the revised project would include
·7· 30 exam rooms for Esperanza, which is -- would be
·8· by a good bit the largest federally qualified
·9· health center and primary care facility that CDF
10· would have funded to date.· A pharmacy, various
11· community spaces, including a community garden,
12· spaces for meetings and trainings on things like
13· healthy eating and cooking.· A 27,000 square foot
14· facility overall.
15· · · · · · · · ·The revised timeline.· The hope had
16· been to close and get underway with construction
17· before the wintertime.· Now Esperanza has had to
18· push that back.· They're actually going through the
19· redesign process.· So the goal would be to start
20· construction as soon as the site thaws out
21· sufficiently to allow the site work to happen in
22· the spring.
23· · · · · · · · ·$17 million total budget.· CDF
24· initially committed 12 million of allocation.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 28

·1· There's a potential here to trim that commitment
·2· back to 10 million or maybe even a little bit less
·3· than 10 million depending on the final repricing of
·4· the construction.
·5· · · · · · · · ·So the authorization we're seeking
·6· is flexibility to say up to 12 million, but with a
·7· goal and an expectation that it will probably be
·8· more like 10.
·9· · · · · · · · ·The other providers of tax credit
10· allocation are Raza Development Fund, which is a
11· CDFI based in Phoenix that serves Latino-focused
12· projects around the country, particularly affiliated
13· organizations of National Council of La Raza, of
14· which Esperanza and Mujeres Latinas are both NCLR
15· affiliates.
16· · · · · · · · ·And then PNC Bank would be the tax
17· credit investor as well as the senior lender to
18· Esperanza Health Centers providing the leverage
19· capital.· And it would put in a million and a half
20· to 2 million of their own allocation.
21· · · · · · · · ·And then Esperanza has 3 million of
22· essentially capital they've been saving up for this
23· project that they would put in as their equity
24· contribution.

·1· · · · · · · · ·So this table shows kind of a quick
·2· comparison of the old project and the new project.
·3· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· And they have to complete
·4· construction within a year?
·5· · · · MR. SMITH:· They're projecting having a soft
·6· opening in February of 2019.· Probably full
·7· operations in the spring of 2019.
·8· · · · MR. LEÓN:· Just for the record, because this
·9· was a concern for me at the Advisory Board, so this
10· resolution pretty much allows the replace- -- of
11· changing the partnership to remove the hospital,
12· Sinai?
13· · · · MR. SMITH:· Yes.
14· · · · MR. LEÓN:· But the allocation is still up to
15· 12 million?
16· · · · MR. SMITH:· 12 with an expectation we can
17· trim it unless there's a shock in the construction
18· pricing when they go back to market.
19· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· Any other questions?
20· · · · MR. LEÓN:· I do have another question.
21· · · · · · · · ·Is there ability to bring another
22· partner?

·1· development instead of Sinai.
·2· · · · MR. SMITH:· Oh, I see.· I mean, they would
·3· certainly have room on the site to build more space
·4· as an addition in the future.
·5· · · · · · · · ·And they're certainly trying to
·6· still strengthen their operating partnerships with
·7· Sinai so that referrals will be more seamless.· For
·8· example, if an Esperanza patient needs diagnostic
·9· or specialty care, so they'll do it as best they
10· can without a physical presence from Sinai for now.
11· But I would imagine they'll hope to build out more
12· space on the site in the future.
13· · · · MR. MITCHELL:· It's a bigger building to be
14· able to have additions added to it.· They're hoping
15· for that.
16· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· Any further questions?
17· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)

·4· · · · · · · · ·The next item, status of amendments
·5· to the CDF Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation.
·6· · · · · · · · ·Tony.
·7· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So the set of actions that
·8· resulted in Rafael León and Aarti Kotak being Board
·9· members, just to recap those real quick.
10· · · · · · · · ·So the Governing Board approved the
11· changes to the bylaws at the July 18th meeting.
12· They were intro'd to City Council on July 26th and
13· approved on September 6th.· And then the Secretary
14· of State accepted the amended Articles of
15· Incorporation on October 31st.
16· · · · · · · · ·So just in a nutshell, that expanded
17· the Board to nine members from the original seven.
18· · · · · · · · ·And then just a few kind of technical
19· updates to the bylaws to reflect the fact that they
20· hadn't been touched since -- substantively since
21· 2005.· So making the definition of quorum a
22· floating number, that's a majority of the then

·2· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· Any questions by the body?
·3· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
·4· · · · · · · · ·Moving right along to status of
·5· previously approved projects.
·6· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So these are a current
·7· list of projects in the portfolio.· So there's
·8· three deals that closed in 2010 that are reaching
·9· the end of their seven-year plan period; the Kroc
10· Community Center down in West Pullman, Testa
11· Produce in the Stockyards, and then the Radio Flyer
12· up on Belmont and Cragin.· Those are all
13· anticipated to unwind according to the original
14· plan during this calendar year, and all are in full
15· compliance.· And we have a good handle on the
16· impact that those projects have generated.· So
17· closing out those three.
18· · · · · · · · ·And then this year so far, looking
19· at the 2017 activity, Casa Norte closed back in
20· June.· And then Lawndale Christian Health Center,
21· which was approved at the last Governing Board
22· meeting, closed in late October and is now underway
23· with construction.
24· · · · · · · · ·As far as construction status

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586
YVer1f

Page 33

·1· update, La Casa Norte is expected to be completed
·2· in July 2018.· And Lawndale Christian has three
·3· components, an urgent care center, an adult day
·4· center, and then an urban agricultural facility.
·5· And so the final construction on those three are
·6· anticipated for October 2018.
·7· · · · CHAIRMAN REIFMAN:· Questions by the body?
·8· · · · · · · · · · · (No response.)
·9· · · · · · · · ·Moving right along, the status of
10· New Market Tax Credits allocation and application.
11· · · · MR. SMITH:· Sure.· So just under 300 million
12· of allocation deployed lifetime to date for CDF.
13· And we have a quick summary of the investment
14· that's been leveraged by that allocation.· The
15· primary source of capital in these deals have been
16· private capital, about two-thirds of the total, and
17· then CDF's NMTC allocation has provided about $90.3
18· million gross subsidy to these projects.
19· · · · · · · · ·And then in some cases there's been
20· other CDE participants.· So 48 million or so of
21· other allocatees providing tax credit allocation;
22· some other public sources, particularly state and
23· federal grants, and then City of Chicago has
24· provided TIF and other financial resources totaling

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc.· 312-781-9586

 MEETING, 11/17/2017

Page 34

·1· 48.5 million to round out the total sources on
·2· those deals.
·3· · · · · · · · ·Looking at CDF's most recent award
·4· of 75 million that was received at the end of 2016.
·5· So 15-1/2 million of that totally closed and
·6· funded.· 7 million was actually pre-funded before
·7· the August 18th federal deadline with PNC Bank that
·8· is earmarked for the Esperanza transaction.· And
·9· then 6 million of allocation that was approved at
10· the last meeting is in the closing process for the
11· Gads Hill Early Childhood Center in Brighton Park.
12· · · · · · · · ·Under the 2017 application process,
13· CDF submitted a competitive app on June 21st in the
14· 2017 round.· Treasury is being vague as usual, but
15· talking about Q1 of 2018 as the likely timeframe to
16· make announcements on that.· The House bill that
17· was actually passed yesterday would eliminate
18· future allocations beyond this upcoming round.· The
19· Senate proposal would not touch the New Markets
20· program.· And so that would leave in place the 2018
21· and 2019 authorizations.· So we'll see how that
22· turns out.
23· · · · · · · · ·There are extensive efforts from
24· many parties on Capitol Hill to try to remind the

·4· So anecdotally there's a lot of support on both

·6· potential for New Markets to get caught up in the

·8· how it plays out.
