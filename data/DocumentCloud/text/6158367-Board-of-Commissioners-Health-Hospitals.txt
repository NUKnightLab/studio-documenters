facility for the purpose of providing additional courtrooms; and
WHEREAS, the facility is centrally located in Cook County in downtown
Oak Park, accessible to the CTA Green Line and the Blue Line, the
METRA railroad line and the Eisenhower Expressway and numerous
PACE and CTA bus lines; and
WHEREAS, the facility includes the Department’s administration offices,
various educational programs, and public information resources, which
are utilized by municipalities, public and private schools, community
groups, the press and the public; and
WHEREAS, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County is located in the far
southwest section of the County and is not nearly as accessible as the
Oak Park location; and
WHEREAS, the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County site requires the
expenditure of public funds, which far outweigh a long term rental of
space in a central location; and
WHEREAS, the people of Cook County and their municipalities and
schools are better served in an accessible, central location, which has
been utilized as such for the past seventeen years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of
Commissioners direct that all efforts and expenditures planned for the
relocation of the Cook County Department of Public Health be
terminated.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved Approval of
Communication No. 298604.
Commissioner Schneider inquired as to what the cost would be to relocate the Cook County
Department of Public Health to Oak Forest and how many years of leases it would take to
recoup those dollars to build out what needs to be done at Oak Forest.
Bruce Washington, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, stated that in regards to
relocation cost and the renovation cost, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy has projected
a cost of $5.1 million. In reference to the lease cost currently the County is spending $601,000
annually, plus $50,000 for operating costs per year. Mr. Washington stated that the costs are
recouped within a number of years.
Commissioner Schneider inquired as to how much time is left on the lease that currently exists
on the building which currently the Cook County Department of Public Health occupies.
Mr. Washington responded that the lease expires April of 2011.
Commissioner Schneider asked if there was a termination clause in the lease.

Stephen A. Martin, Jr., Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Operating Officer, Department of Public Health,
stated that when the lease originally came up the Department of Public Health negotiated with
the landlord and let them know what the Department of Public Health’s plans were and agreed
to a three (3) year time period in terms of the Capital build out. The lease was structured in
such a way that it only gives the Department of Public Health time for the renovation to build out
and it also took into account that if the renovations went as quickly as they could predict
(probably 2010) the Department of Public Health could get out of the lease as early as 2010.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Dr. Martin conduct a survey of Department of Public
Health Employees regarding the relocation.
Dr. Martin stated that he will perform a survey and get back to the Committee.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to defer
Communication No. 298604. The motion carried. Chairman Butler, Commissioners Daley
and Gorman voted No.

Chairman Butler asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers, in
accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):
