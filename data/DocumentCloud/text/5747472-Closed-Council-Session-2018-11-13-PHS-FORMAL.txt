RE: Request to Outright Vacate Utility Easement Project: Wayne County
On the Block Bounded By Justice Complex
Russell, Riopelle, Frederick and Kirby

Project Number: 19252.03D

Wayne County, as owner of the property located at 5300 Russell Street, has authorized Giffels Webster to
request and facilitate the vacation of a utility easement on the subject property. Giffels Webster,
headquartered at 28 W. Adams, Suite 1200, Detroit, Michigan 48226, therefore respectfully requests the City
of Detroit outright vacate the following utility easement:

. Outright vacation of an 18? wide utility easement within the previously vacated [with easement] alley
extending north from Frederick Ave, adjacent to lot 25 of the Guoin Farm Subdivision North of Gratiot
Road. The current easement also borders lots 6 10 of Patrick?s Subdivision of Guoin Farm North
of Gratiot Road. Approximate limits of the vacation can be found in Exhibit 1, enclosed herein.

Giffels Webster has been authorized to facilitate the requested vacation. We will be working with the City of
Detroit?s Department of Public Works?City Engineering Division, and all stakeholders to achieve vacations
that are satisfactory to all interested parties.

The requested vacation will neither impede pedestrian and vehicular traffic, nor will it interfere with the
maintenance of the public rights-of?way, including utility company and Fire and Police Departments access.
Furthermore, the existing sewer located within this easement does not service other properties and can be
removed without negative impact on the community. Please refer to the supplemental information enclosed
for details.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Scott Clein by phone, at 313.962.4442,
or by email, at sclein@giffeiswebster.com .

November 8, 2018
Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 1821 Giffels Webster, request to vacate a series of public alleys
and street rights-of-way within and adjacent to Woodward, Monroe,
Randolph, Farmer, Bates and Cadillac Square in the City of Detroit,
Michigan.

Background:

Petition 1821 requests changes to public rights-of?way to prepare for the redevelopment of
the Monroe Block site Goounded by Cadillac Square, Woodward Avenue, Monroe Avenue,
Farmer Street and Bates Street), also to prepare for redevelopment the Bates Block site
(bounded by Randolph Street, Monroe Avenue, Farmer Street and Bates Street). The
Downtown Detroit Development Authority (DDA) and Rosko Development Company
LLC (?Bedrock?) have or are entering into a Development Agreement to facilitate this
important major new development. Certain changes to the rights-of?way are necessary to
?nalize the preparation of the Monroe and Bates Blocks for the development and allow for
clear title to the land to be transferred for the project.

The City of Detroit owns all public rights-of?way in the unique area of Detroit platted in
the ?Governor and Judges?. Therefore, the City will deed the title to the vacated rights-of-
way to the DDA to then be transferred to the developer. Certain easements will be required
and these easements shall also be transferred in the same manner. The easements aim to
protect certain public and utility interests while also minimizing the impact on the ability
to develop the land. The developer along with their project engineers have been meeting
with all potentially involved agencies and utility companies to assure that satisfactory
arrangements have been made regarding utility placement, abandonment or relocation.

City Engineering Division DPW notes there have been previous resolutions in the area
including: 1) The vacation of Library Street in a resolution recorded December14, 1953 in
Liber 11949, Page 276; also 2) The vacation of alleys in the ?Monroe Block? recorded
February 20, 2002 in Liber 35633, Page 65. The intention with the current resolution is to
replace and supersede the previously granted resolutions.

Petition No. 1821
Giffels Webster on behalf of Bedrock request for the following vacations and granting of
easements:

 

 

A) Vacation of rights-of-wav: (as more particularly described in the following
resolution)

 

1) Library Street, 60 feet wide, from Monroe Avenue, 120 feet wide, to Randolph

property change provided the proposed use does not hinder or impede the installation,
operation, maintenance or replacement of DTE Gas Company facilities. A provision for
the petitioner to remove and relocate the DTE-G facilities at the petitioner?s expense is a
part of the resolution.

Detroit Thermal has facilities in the subject area and a provision for the petitioner to pay
for the removal of the Detroit Thermal facilities is a part of the resolution.

Redford, MI 48240

To: HONORABLE DETROIT CITY COUNCIL
Mike Duggan, Mayor, City of Detroit
Dave Bell, Director, BSEED

From: Erin Wills, Corresponding Secretary
Castle Rouge Civic Association

Re: illegal parking of semi-trailers on land zoned P1

On behalf of the Residents of the Castle Rouge Community located in Detroit, Michigan, City Council
District 1, i submit the following to the Detroit City Council for your consideration and referral to the
Administration via the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department:

The subject properties located near the intersection of Dale Street and Schoolcraft Avenue being
identified as 13591, 13583 and 13575 Dales Street are currently zoned P1 (Open Parking District) which
according the Sec. 61-11-41 of the Detroit City Code, Zoning, is described as a district:

for off?street parking of private passenger vehicles on property which abuts, or is separated
by an alley or easement from, a non?residential district. The regulations permit the establishment of
parking facilities to serve the non-residential uses, and at the same time do not permit the non-
residential uses themselves to extend into residential areas. The district will assist in reducing traffic
congestion caused by non-residential uses and at the same time will protect abutting residential areas
from the deleterious e??ects of adjacent vehicular parking areas.?

The adjacent property in question is a Marathon gas station located at 13550 Telegraph Road, Reford
Charter Twp, MI 48239. The gas station was once a Comerica Bank branch before being converted into
its present use. While a Comerica Bank branch, the three aforementioned parcels located in Detroit, MI
on Dale street were zoned P1 as a part of that development solely for the purpose of minimizing
?parking? and ?vehicular? impacts on the adjacent residential properties on Dale Street in Detroit.

Previous gas station owners have sought to utilize the three parcels for parking for semi-trailers which is
first permitted in the 36 (General Services District) zoning classi?cation, and all requests were rightfully
denied by the City Planning Commission and ultimately by the Detroit City Council.

The residents of the Castle Rouge Community, particularly those whom reside on Dale Street are directly
affected by the presence of the trailers, have reached out to the property owner on several occasions to

no avail, only to be met with indifference and at times profanity or threats of violence from the clerks.
The Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department as well as the Detroit Police
Department have attempted to address the issue, however, the Issue continues to persist.

We have ta ken the step of reaching out to our County Commissioners, State Representatives and State
Senators who abut the Marathon gas station in an attempt to end the illegal practice of parking semi-
trailers and semi-truck cabs adjacent to a residential neighborhood without the benefit of zoning.

We are requesting that this matter be investigated and that the city code should be enforced so that the
property owner, which is identified as Tel-96 Investment, LLC with a resident agent named as All K.
Ajami, residing at 12950 Morrow Circle, Dearborn, MI 48126 be forced to remove all semi?truck cabs,
semi-trailers, tires, and other debris from the properties identified as 13591, 13583 and 13575 Dale

Street, Detroit, MI 48223.

We have attached photos taken on the morning of Wednesday, October 10, 2018 which show four semi?
trailers and one semi-truck cap on the subject properties. If you have any additional questions or
concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact the Castle Rouge Civic Association directly at

313-405-9013 or by email at CastleRouge@gmail.com.
We thank you for your consideration of this matter look forward to an expeditious resolution to this

unfortunate situation.

Respectfully submitted,
