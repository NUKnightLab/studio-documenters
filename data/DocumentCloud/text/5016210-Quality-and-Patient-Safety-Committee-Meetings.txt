PATIENT EXPERIENCE UPDATE

4

QPS Committee I October 19, 2018

 Contributing Factors to current limited patient
Experience improvement…(the “whys”)
• Workforce engagement is a continuous process.
• The pace of correction of experience-related and
well-understood operational problems, ex. waiting,
phone access, cleanliness will continue to be
primary drivers of the efforts.
• Culture transformation and individual change
happen slowly.
• Re HCAHPS scores, limited improvements are only
possible through a “staggered approach” and a
five-year plan.

QPS Committee I October 19, 2018

 Solutions
Setting customer service standards is just the beginning.
Continue to share data reports – (Quarterly to approx. 25 staff members and
monthly to approx. 40 staff)
• Survey scores are important but limited indicators without associated QI
action (access to PG website Feb-Aug 2018 – 9 CCHHS staff per month)
Potential next steps:
Person and Care-giver Advisory Council
QI training PDSA, SBAR etc.)
QI pilot projects
Increasing staff engagement
Annual training inclusion on LMS – customer service
standards/tools
• It’s beyond training – change is local/“in the neighborhoods” – units, sites,
departments: based on local champions, management skill-building,
accountability and sustainability.
