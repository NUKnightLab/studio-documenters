PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ESTABLISHMENT OF MONTHLY REVENUE REPORT
WHEREAS, Cook County has recently undergone an arduous budget process; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that the President and the Board of Commissioners be
kept informed as to any discrepancies between the County's actual revenues and the
estimated revenues found on pages 8, 9 and 10 of the Revenue Estimates Book for
the FY 2006 budget; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to keep the President and the Board of Commissioners
informed the Comptroller is directed to compile a monthly report of actual monthly
revenues versus estimated monthly revenues and submit the reports to the President
of the Board; and
WHEREAS, in turn, the President will direct the monthly reports to the Finance
Comm ittee to be received and filed; and
WHEREAS, the monthly reports are a prudent way to ensure the FY 2006 revenues
are on track and, if revenues are not coming in as projected , the President and Board
of Commissioners will be able to take immediate corrective action; and
WHEREAS, precedent for monthly reports has already been established as both the
Cook County Highway and Capital Planning and Policy departments issue monthly
progress reports to keep the board abreast of projects; and
WHEREAS, this new monthly revenue report from the Comptroller's office will be
established in that same vein.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners directs the Cook County Comptroller to issue said reports on
a monthly basis to keep the President and Board of Commissioners apprised of the
County's financial situation.
