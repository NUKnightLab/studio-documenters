MINUTES OF THE DETROIT BROWNFIELD
REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY SPECIAL MEETING
WEDNESDAY, JULY 13, 2016
DETROIT ECONOMIC GROWTH CORPORATION
500 GRISWOLD SUITE 2200 DETROIT, MI - 4:00PM

CALL TO ORDER
Vice Chairperson, Maggie DeSantis, called the meeting to order at 4:04 PM.
At 4:06 PM Chairperson Matthew Walters arrived.
GENERAL
Approval of Minutes
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the minutes of June 22, 2016 as presented.
The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. DeSantis, seconded by Mr. Scott, DBRA Resolution Code 1607-02-204 was unanimously approved.

ADMINISTRATIVE
Ms. Kanalos and Mr. Long presented the DBRA Budget for FY 2016-2017 that had been
tabled from the June 22, 2016 board meeting.
Ms. DeSantis asked Mr. Long why the $330,000 line item for the Detroit Economic Growth
Corporation (DEGC) remains the same as last year’s despite Mr. Papapanos’ retirement.
Mr. Long explained that the DEGC line item includes the time of multiple DEGC staff
members, not just the staff members who appear at the DBRA meetings. Furthermore,
the DEGC plans to hire an additional staff member at some point during the financial year
to assist with DBRA administration.
Ms. DeSantis stated that the DBRA board as well as City Council have asked for
community outreach to inform more people about the availability of the Brownfield TIF
program. She questioned whether the $1,500 budgeted in the Workshops/Promotions
line item would be sufficient to support the outreach efforts.

 Mr. Long noted that in addition to the $1,500 in Workshops/Promotions, there is also
$1,000 available in the Other Expenses line which could also be used. Mr. Long added
that without an approved budget, the DBRA is currently unable to pay its expenses.
Additionally, if the proposed budget is modified before it’s approved by the board, the
mandatory public hearing process will have to restart adding additional time to the
approval process. Once the budget is approved, it can be amended by the board at a
future date without having to have a public hearing.
Ms. McClain stated that starting the budget process earlier in the year would be
preferable.
Mr. Long stated that the DBRA could create a finance committee for reviewing and
providing input to each fiscal year budget. Ms. Kanalos stated that she would coordinate
the creation of a finance committee.
Mr. Walters asked if a board member was ready to propose a motion for the FY 20162017 budget.
Ms. DeSantis moved to approve the proposed budget for Financial Year 2016-2017 with
the following amendments: a finance committee is formed to work on the FY 2017-2018
budget; an amendment to the budget may occur at a future date if additional funds are
needed for community outreach; and that the line item titled Detroit Economic Growth
Corporation is renamed DEGC Professional Services Contract.
On a motion by Ms. DeSantis, seconded by Mr. Sanders, DBRA Resolution Code
16-07-01-167, as amended, was unanimously approved.

OTHER
Mr. Long recommended that the finance committee consist of the DBRA Treasurer and
other board members that wish to volunteer for the committee. In his experience three
members of the committee has been a number that has worked well.
Mr. Scott informed the board that the EPA Revolving Loan Funds from the City should be
transferred to the DBRA before the next board meeting.

PUBLIC COMMENT
None
ADJOURNMENT
There being no further business, Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the
adjournment of the meeting. On a motion by Mr. Sanders, seconded by Ms. Wilkins, the
board agreed unanimously to adjourn the meeting at 4:31 PM.
