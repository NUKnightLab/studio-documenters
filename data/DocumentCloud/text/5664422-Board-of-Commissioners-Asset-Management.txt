on federal property. It is the intent of this Cook County Ordinance to provide the same priority to licensed

(1) Establish, continue, maintain, and promote the opportunities for vending facilities in conjunction
with Business Enterprise Program for the Blind on all property owned or leased by the County.
(2) Provide documents detailing all current vending, office coffee, micromarket and foodservice
contracts including contracting company, location, type of service, commission structure, overall
sales and expiration date.
(3) Facilitate transitions from outside companies to the Blind Vendor and the Business Enterprise
Program on County property.

Coffee Service (OCS) and lottery operations on county property owned or leased
(6) Bid preference is given the Blind Vendors in the operation of cafeterias operated with the County

Vendors. The Blind Vendors may partner with contractors in the County Bid Process.
(7) No County Department may impose any commission, service charge, rent or utility charge on a
licensed Blind Vendor who operates a vending facility on Cook County property.
(8) The County shall actively pursue all commissions from vending facilities not operated by blind
vendors as provided in this Ordinance, and shall propose new placements of vending facilities on
County property where a facility is not yet in place.
(9) A commission rate equal to commission currently paid to the County or of 20% on Net Sales
(whatever is greater) shall be paid by outside vending micro-market or Office Coffee Services
contractors to the Illinois Committee of Blind Vendors for use by the ICBV to benefit blind
vendors through the existing Blind Vendor Trust Fund.
(10) Partnerships and teaming arrangements between blind vendors and private industry, including
franchise operations, shall be allowed and encouraged by the County.
Sec. 2-365 Satisfactory Vending Facility Sites

(a) Beginning March 1, 2018, all County real estate agreements shall: With the BEPB jointly

Vending Facility site not operated by Blind Vendors shall be considered a suitable site for a Blind Vendor.

building is satisfactory or not satisfactory for the operation of a blind vendor vending facility. A site shall

County employees, County contractual employees, and the general public. The determination shall be

If the property has an existing private vendor, bottler, or vending machine operator, then the property shall
be presumed to be a satisfactory site. If the BEPB, in consultation with the Committee, determines that
the number of people using the location is or will be insufficient to support a vending facility, then the
BEPB shall determine the property to be not satisfactory. Upon a determination by the BEPB and the
Committee that the new property or building is satisfactory for the operation of a blind vendor vending
