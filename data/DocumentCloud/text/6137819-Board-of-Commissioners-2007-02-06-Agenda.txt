STEPHEN A. MARTIN, JR., Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Operating Officer, Department of Public Health
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $197,805.00 to McKesson Drug for the flu vaccine.
Reason:

The Flu vaccine needs to be pre-ordered ten (10) months in advance to be available for the flu
season. The flu vaccine was pre-ordered in February 2006 from our pharmaceutical vendor
McKesson Drug. The Amerisource-Bergen contract was awarded August 1, 2006.
Amerisource-Bergen could not provide the flu vaccine under the new contract because the
Department of Public Health had not pre-ordered, therefore the department needed to obtain
the flu vaccine from McKesson Drug.
