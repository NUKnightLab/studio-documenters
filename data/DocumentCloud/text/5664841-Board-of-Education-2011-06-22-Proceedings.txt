THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the principal of Melville W. Fuller Elementary School ("Fuller"), Patricia Kennedy, be removed and
replaced pursuant to Section of the ililnois School Code and that her contract be terminated
pursuant to Section of the Board's Uniform Principal's Performance Contract.

DESCRIPTION:
i. Legal Framework

The School Code grants the Chief Executive Of?cer of the Chicago Public Schools the
authority to place schools on probation to correct deficiencies in their academic performance (105 
5134-83). The School Code further grants the Chicago Board of Education (?Board') the authority
to establish guidelines to determine the factors for placing an attendance center on probation. 105 ILCS


Pursuant to that authority. the Board has in place policies under which Fuller was placed on probation
The Board recently adopted the "School Performance. Remediation and Probation Policy for the 2010-
2011 School Year," (Board Report 10-0728-P03) and Fuller will remain on Probation in accord with the
terms of that policy.

The School Code provides that when a school on probation fails to make adequate progress to correct
deficiencies within one year. the CEO. with the approval of the Board and after an opportunity for a
hearing. may remove and replace the school's principal. 105 Pursuant to Section 
of the Board's Uniform Principal's Performance Contract. a principal's contract may be terminated before
the expiration of Its four-yearterm based upon the principal's removal pursuant to Section 

June 22, 2011

ll. Hearing on Principal Removal

Pursuant to the ?Guidelines for the Removal and Replacement of Principals of Schools on Probation for
the 2010-2011 School Year" and the ?Procedures Governing Principal Removal Hearings.? Patricia
Kennedy. Fuller's principal. and the Fuller Local School Council (LSC) were duly noti?ed that the CEO
was contemplating the removal of Patricia Kennedy as principal pursuant to Section to further
the school's educatlonal improvement. Mr. Fredrick H. Bates. Esq. an independent hearing officer.
presided over the Fuller principal removal hearing on Monday. March 28. 2011. in an efficient and
impartial manner.

The Law Department. representing the CEO, presented the statements of the Area 13 Chief Area Officer
and the Director of Performance Policy from the Office of Research. Evaluation and Accountability as well
as documentation to support a recommendation to remove Patricia Kennedy as Fuller's principal to the
hearing officer. The hearing was uncontested.

The hearing officer has submitted a written report to the CEO summarizing all relevant evidence offered
during the hearing. making findings of fact. and recommending the removal of Patricia Kennedy as the
princrpai of Fuller.

Ill. Chief Executive Officer?s Recommendation

The CEO has reviewed the Hearing Of?cer's findings of fact and recommendation and hereby
recommends that Patricia Kennedy be removed and replaced as the principal of Fuller effective at the
end of the 2010-2011 academic school year. The CEO further recommends that Patricia Kennedy?s
Uniform Principal's Performance Contract. with a term beginning November 20. 2008. and ending
November 19. 2012. be terminated effective June 30. 2011. These recommendations are based upon
the following factors:

A. Fuller has a history of poor performance. Fuller has been on probation for the past four (4) schoot
years. including the 2010-2011 school year. Ms. Kennedy has served as principal at Fuller tor the
past ten (10) school years.

B. In each subject on the ISAT. the gap between Fuller and the District average has remained high
and has been widening. Fuller?s 2009-2010 performance on the Composite was 35.7%.
compared to a District average of 71.8%. Since the 2003-2004 school year. Fuller's performance
on the Compoaite has not increased. During that time period. the District improved from
47% to 71.8%. an increase of 24.8 percentage points. The performance gap between Fuller and
the District is consistent across subjects.

C. In addition to standardized test scores. the CPS Performance Policy evaluates schools on
attendance rate. The attendance rate for Fuller has been consistently lower than the District
average. Between the 2003-2004 school year and the 2009-2010 school year. Fuller's
attendance rate has not been above 93%. In 2009-2010. Fuller's attendance rate was 91.7%.
which was in the bottom 10% of attendance rates among elementary schools in the District.

If the Board adopts the CEO's recommendation to remove the Fuller principal. the following actions Will

occur

1. The CEO will appoint an interim principal for Fuller. based upon the recommendations of the
Chief Education Officer. The interim principal will serve at the pleasure of the and

2. The LSC shall have no authority to select a new four-year contract principal until Fuller makes

sufficient academic progress to be removed from probation.
REVIEW: LSC approval is not applicable to this report.
FINANCIAL: The interim principal position will be filled at a cost within current budget appropriations
PERSONNEL IMPLICATIONS: An Interim Principal will be selected. who will serve at the pleasure of the

CEO. Until the school comes off probation. the Local School Council of Fuller will have no authority to
select a new four-year contract principal. as required by Board Policy.

President Vitale indicated that if there were no objections, Board Report 11-0622-EX16
would be adopted by the last favorable roll call vote, all members present voting therefore.

DESCRIPTION:

In June 2008. the Board authorized the use of 33.000.000 in unspent operating funds to assist charter
and contract schools in making their older independent~site campuses more accessible. especially those
campuses that were chosen before the Board began heightened ADA guidance to new school
applicants in 2006. Through a competitive application process. five charter organizations were choSen to
receive these ADA grants. The amounts of and conditions precedent to each grant were uniquely tailored
to each campus? particular accessibility challenges. but all grants required substantial contribution from
the charter organization.

44

June 22, 2011

Since that original award of grants. two of the grantees (Namaste Charter School and Chicago
International Charter School I Longwood Campus) have completed their accessibility renovations and
received their grant funds. One organization (UNO Charter School( determined that the cost of
making its Carlos Fuentes Campus accessible in the manner the Board required would be significantly
more expensive than anticipated. and thus deferred contracting until the Board could determine whether
additiOnai contingency grant funds were available. The final two organizations (Academy of
Communications and Technology Charter School and Betty Shabazz lntemational Charter
School ("Shabazz"). failed to meet the conditions precedent to their grant awards and. after several
extensions of time. their awards were rescinded by the Board in the spring of 2010.

To date. the Board has spent 51.018.050 of the original $3,000,000 intended for this increased
accessibility. The remaining $1,981,950 was not spent under the previous Board authority. In order to
use these funds as originally intended. without disadvantaging any eligible organizations that might have
applied for and received this remaining money. in May 2010. the Of?ce of New Schools and the
Department of Operations notified the same group of applicants as in 2008 of the availability of
Supplemental ADA Grant funds. Three school organizations submitted applications.

As in 2008. the applications asked for information about each applicant. including: a) demographic.
geographic. programmatic. and structural need for more access at the applicant campus; b) general
facility condition. long-term plans. and other factors relevant to the prudence of investing funds into the
campus: and c) demonstrated strength and reliability of the charter organization. especially with regard to
facility care. Each applicant was asked to propose ADA renovation plans and to commit to those plans if
grants are awarded. Each applicant was required to raise its own funds to cover a portion of its ADA
renOvation plans. Applicants were required to provide documentation assuring the feasibility of the
construction and fundraising aspects of each plan.

A Grant Evaluation Committee. comprised of the Board's Director of ADA Policy. representatives from the
Office of New Schools and the Department of Operations evaluated the applications and made
recommendations that the supplemental grant money be awarded as described in the attached table
(mended Attachment A).

GRANT PERIODNERM: The term of each grant agreement shall cemmence on the date the agreement
is fully execmed and shall and upon the expiration date Specified in the agreement. or the completion of
all of the agreed-upon building renovations, whichever comes first.

CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATORS Each charter school operator will be required
to comply with the ADA renovation plan submitted to the Board and to provide funding to cover a certain
percentage of the constructionfrenovation cost. Each charter school operator will also be required to
perform dedicated outreach to the disability community. In addition. the grant agreements will provrde
that any Charter school operator that does not complete the agreed-upon ADA renovation plan the
prescribed deadline will be reqwred to repay to the Board all or a portion of grant funds expended.

GRANT AMOUNTS: The estimated grant amount for each charter school operator is listed on
Attachment A. The total aggregate grant amount payable to all charter school operators shall not exceed
31.981.950.

AUTHORIZATION: Authorize the General Counsel to include other relevant terms and conditions in the
grant distribution agreements. Authorize the President and Secretary to execute the grant agreements.
Authorize the Director of ADA Policy to execute all ancillary documents required to administer 0r

TERM: The term of this agreement shall commence upon date of signing and shall continue 15 years
from the start of the energy savings guarantee. ending no later than June 30. 2024

EARLY TERMINATION RIGHT: The Board shall have the right to terminate this agreement with 30 days
written notice.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF Energy performance contracting is a mechanism Outlined in
section 19b of the Illinois School Code by which school districts can pay for energy eI?CIency
improvements in buildings through the reduction in utility costs that are generated by the improvements.
A qualified energy services company (5800) performs an inspection of the building. called an energy
audit, and identifies energy conservation measures (ECM) that will result in an overall reduction in the
utility costs for the facility. The ESCO then guarantees that the school district will save the amount of
money identified by the sum total of ECM. With that guarantee. either a third-party finances the up-Iront
costs of each ECM and the school district repays the debt with the funds saved from the utility budget
over the period of time guaranteed in the contract. or the ESCO finances the ECM and repays itself and
any debt burden with funds from the school district that were allocated to pay for the energy that is saved.
or the school district self-finances the work and retains the guaranteed directly. The Board will
self-finance the project. If in any year during the contract. the district does not realize the savings
guarantee. the E800 pays the district for the shortfall.

SPECIFIC SCOPE OF SERVICES: The Vendor has provided an energy audit as part of its response to
the RFC, and will perform all of the work associated with each ECM identified in their contract with the
Board. Upon completion of each ECM. the Vendor will measure and verify the savings associated with
that particular ECM. providing reconciliation against the expected cost of utility prior to the implementation

64

June 22, 2011

of the ECM. The Board will provide the financing for each ECM. The measures to be executed at 125
South Clark Street are as follows (number and scope of ECM may be changed upon mutual agreement of
the parties. herein called the "Project")?
. Installation of new. efficient steam boilers sized for the facrlity.
. Installation of new. ef?cient chilled water system to replace the existing district chilled water
system.
- Modi?cation of the existing chilled water distribution system.
- Installation of a building automation system to operate the heating. ventilating and air conditioning
systems.
- Replace the existing light fixtures with new. efficient fixtures.
0 install a state-of~the-art. effective lighting control system.
0 Replace the existing windows.

DELIVERABLES: The Vendor will provide documentation that each ECM in the contract is complete.
commissioned and operational; included in this documentation will be the information required to maintain
any and all equipment installed as part of the ECM. During the guarantee portion of the agreement. the
Vendor will provide annual reconciliation of the actual energy savings relative to the usage prior to the
execution of the agreement. The Vendor will provide ongoing measurement and veri?cation of the ECM
performance and regular reporting of the results.

OUTCOMES: After the implementation of all ECM. the energy usage of the 125 Scuth Clark Street
building will be 60% or less of the level used in ?scal year 2006.

COMPENSATION: Currently the Board includes 82.150.000.00 (in 2006 dollars) in its annual utility
budget to pay the utilities for the 125 South Clark Street building. The compensation to the vendor will be
an amount determined by the final scope of ECM determined by the vendor and the Board, but not to
exceed 317.600.000.00. The maximum amount allowed under the law is that specmc portion of that
amount of the fiscal year 2007 budget that is saved by the Vendor's performance of each ECM. also
known as the Savings Guarantee (final amount to be set at contract signature. but currently set at
51.449.100.00) realized over 20 year period, The recommendation for this contract is that the savings be
realized in no more than 15 years. The Board will remain responsible for the remainder of the utility
budget. known as Post Retro?t Energy Usage (currently set at 3700.900 00). and will have available to it
the value of the yearly Savings Guarantee. Therefore this is a revenue neutral contract. The Vendor
provides 3 Savings Guarantee as part of the agreement. This guarantee means that unless the Board
changes the energy usage of the building in the future. the Board's energy usage Will not exceed the Post
Retrofit Energy Usage. If the Board's energy savings are not realized. the Vendor will be responsible for
the additional costs. The Board will remain responsible for any rate increases on the Post Retrofit Energy
Usage.
