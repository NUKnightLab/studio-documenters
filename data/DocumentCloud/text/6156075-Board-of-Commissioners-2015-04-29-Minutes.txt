function relating to its government and affairs including the power to regulate for the protection of the
public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, in the spring of 2014, Arizona-based Lipsmark, LLC announced that it intended to market

and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has concluded that it does not have a legal basis to
block market entry of the product at this time; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 29, 2015

WHEREAS, Lipsmark plans to manufacture Palcohol in two different formulations: an ingestible beverage
formulation and a non-ingestible industrial formulation; and
WHEREAS, Palcohol’s ingestible beverage formulation is freeze-dried powderized alcohol which turns
water into either vodka or rum, or optional flavors including cosmopolitan, mojito and the Powderita- a

underage drinkers to use discreetly; and
WHEREAS, underage drinking is a significant problem that threatens the health and safety of our youth,
contributes to crime and negatively impacts the entire community; and
WHEREAS, many states, including New York, Alaska, Delaware, Louisiana, South Carolina and

RESOLUTION

THE HONORABLE RICHARD R. BOYKIN, Cook County Board Commissioner
RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF ILLINOIS
FOR ITS REPORT ON “STOP AND FRISK” POLICE PRACTICES AND CALLING UPON
THE CITY OF CHICAGO TO ADOPT THE REFORMS RECOMMENDED IN THE REPORT
WHEREAS, despite the fact that the nation’s attention has turned to police practices because of high profile
killings, concerns about policing extend beyond the use of force and into the everyday interactions of
police with community members; and,
WHEREAS, in black and Latino communities, these everyday interactions are often a “stop and frisk”;
and,
WHEREAS, under the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), officers are
allowed to stop you if the officer has reasonable suspicion that you have been, are, or are about to be
engaged in criminal activity. Once you are stopped, if an officer has reasonable suspicion that you are
dangerous and have a weapon, the officer can frisk you, including ordering you to put your hands on a wall
or car, and running his or her hands over your body; and,
WHEREAS, a report on “Stop and Frisk” police practices by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
of Illinois, published just last month, contains troubling signs that the Chicago Police Department has a
current practice of unlawfully using stop and frisk; and,

Page 12 of 192

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 29, 2015

WHEREAS, “Stop and Frisk” is disproportionately concentrated in the black community. Last month’s
ACLU Report found that black Chicagoans were subjected to 72% of all stops, though they constitute just
32% of the city’s population; and,
WHEREAS, the ACLU of Illinois, comparing stops to population, found that Chicagoans were stopped
more than four times as often as New Yorkers at the height of New York City’s stop and frisk practice;
and,
WHEREAS, the abuse of stop and frisk is a violation of individual rights, but it also poisons police and
community relations and directly impacts the bottom line for Cook County taxpayers by leading to arrests
that would not have otherwise occurred, thereby burdening Cook County Courts and the Cook County Jail;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County President and the Board of Commissioners
that the appreciation of this body be expressed to the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois for its
report on “Stop and Frisk” in the City of Chicago; and,
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED by the Cook County President and the Board of Commissioners that the
recommendations contained in the above-referenced report including additional tracking, data collection
and process around the “Stop and Frisk” practice be enacted at the earliest possible opportunity.
Approved and adopted this 29th of April 2015.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 29, 2015

Summary: This Request Package contains three (3) PINs. The Village intends to use the vacant land as a
water retention area as part of its roadway realignment and resurfacing project, which use will greatly
benefit the Village’s commercial district by reducing flooding on the roadway adjacent to the parcels and
in the surrounding areas and will comply with current Illinois Department of Transportation roadway
standards.
The Village will file for tax exempt status upon acquisition of the PINs because it will retain the PINs for
municipal use. The Village has not received a request from a third party by which the Village would convey
the certificate(s) of purchase or the perfected tax deed(s) for the PINs to said third party for development.
The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed(s) and bear all legal and other costs associated
with acquisition of the parcels. The Village agrees to submit to the Cook County Department of Economic
Development, on a form provided by that department, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for
five years or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No
Cash Bid Ordinance.
___________________________

maintain such tax exempt status until the tax deed for the PIN is conveyed to a developer. The Village has
not received a request from a third party by which the Village would convey the certificate of purchase or
the perfected tax deed for the PIN to said third party for development. The Village will retain legal counsel
to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other costs associated with acquisition of the parcel. The Village
agrees to submit to the Cook County Department of Economic Development, on a form provided by that
department, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for five years or until development is complete,
whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Aleks Briedis, Executive Director, Community Park District of La Grange Park
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of La Grange Park
Volume and Property Index Number:
175, 15-33-411-051-0000
Summary: This Request Package contains one PIN. This property is vacant land that is located between
our existing Beach Oak Park and the Indiana Belt Harbor Railroad. The property contains mature trees and
thick underbrush. The District was recently awarded an Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)
Open Space Lands Acquisition and Development (OSLAD) grant for redevelopment of our Beach Oak
Park. We believe by acquiring this parcel that we could incorporate the land into our park, expanding the
park size in its southwest corner and improve it aesthetically. A site plan of the proposed improvements is
attached.
If acquired, the District will file for tax exempt status and will request to rezone it as park land with the
Village of La Grange Park. The part of the parcel which has railroad tracks is intended to be transferred to
the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad, a possible Third Party Requestor. We are currently in discussions of their
interest in being a Third Party Requestor. The District will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and
bear all legal and other costs associated with acquisition of the parcel. The District agrees to submit, to the
Cook County Department of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for
five years or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No
Cash Bid Ordinance.

RELATIONS OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS TO DISCUSS
SUPPORTING THE INTERMEDIATE SERVICE CENTERS OF COOK COUNTY

Page 17 of 192

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 29, 2015

WHEREAS, the Intermediate Service Centers (“ISCs”) of Cook County play a crucial role in providing
shared services to the public and non-public school districts of suburban Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Regional Safe Schools Program (“RSSP”) is one of the critical educational programs
ffered to the youth of suburban Cook County, and has been offered to the suburban Cook County public
schools districts since 1997; and
WHEREAS, the RSSP initiative serves as the key youth drop-out and expulsion prevention program that
keeps young people (Grades 6-12) in school with an opportunity for graduation and enhanced success; and
WHEREAS, should these students not receive educational services and enter into the juvenile justice
system, the cost to the State of Illinois is egregious; and
WHEREAS, Governor Rauner February budget address eliminated grant support for the RSSP throughout
the State; and
BE IT RESOLVED, since the dissolution of the Suburban Cook County Regional Office of Education
(“ROE”) # 14 in 2010, the ISCs have taken on all duties and responsibilities of the Suburban Cook County
Regional Office of Education; and
BE IT RESOLVED, all other 101 counties in the State of Illinois provide fiscal supports for their ROEs,
and consider their ROEs to be a branch of county government;
BE IT RESOLVED, Counties supply such tangible supports such as providing rent-free space in county
buildings, county-supplied insurance benefits, county personnel to carry out ROE duties, and salary
stipends for ROE administrators; and
BE IT RESOLVED, the continued diminishment of state and federal grants and funding has caused the
ISCs to incur annual fiscal deficits; and
BE IT RESOLVED, the continued existence of the ISCs is now in question due to the existing fiscal
constraints and lack of support of Cook County; and
BE IT RESOLVED, these fiscal constraints call into question whether the ISCs can continue to provide
educator licensure support, bus driver training (for all of Cook County and Chicago Public Schools),
issuance of building and occupancy permits, Health/Life Safety inspections, annual Illinois State Board of
Education compliance visits, non-public school recognition services, truancy services, McKinney-Vento
homeless services, and professional development activities at several levels;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Legislation and Intergovernmental Committee of the Cook
County Commissioners will hold a Hearing to examine the relationship between the County of Cook and
the Intermediate Service Centers; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the intent of the Hearing will be to investigate how supports can be
provided to the Intermediate Service Centers to carry out their critical mission of serving the youth of Cook
County, Illinois.

Summary: A Request for Proposals was released in September 2014 for Group Term Life Insurance
Benefits for Cook County Employees in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code. Minnesota
Life Insurance Company was selected based on established evaluation criteria. The vendor will provide full
record keeping, online evidence of insurability, and an electronic beneficiary designation and claim
submission process, which represents significant improvements to this County employee health benefit.
The basic group term life insurance coverage provided by the County for employees is provided at no cost
to the employee. Employees are also offered a supplemental product. The current supplemental product is
a flat rate for all enrolled employees; the new vendor is proposing an age banded supplemental life
insurance plan which, in turn, improves the pricing of the basic group term life product. The monthly
premium rates are guaranteed for the term of the contract and represent a cost-savings over the incumbent
vendor.

Presented by: PHIL BOOTHBY, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
JOB ORDER CONTRACT
Department: Department of Capital Planning & Policy
Summary: The Department of Capital Planning & Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief
Procurement Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to
complete the twelve (12) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that
allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a
single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected
contractors.
The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
generated contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with Maintenance, repairs,
replacement and routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any work
performed by the contractor is a contractor markup form the price book. The Gordian Group would receive
5% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The Gordian Group

Page 44 of 192

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 29, 2015

will manage the JOC process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant with the terms and
conditions outlined in the JOC contract within the County.
The Department of Capital Planning & Policy, proposes to assign the projects listed below to the Gordian
Group to share with participating JOC contractors.
Project Descriptions:
1. Countywide Emergency Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) and Expansion - After a

systemic review by the County’s DCPP and BOT it was determined that the existing backup
power systems are beyond their useful life as well as need for providing additional capacity to
existing UPS or in some cases providing backup power where no system of this type existed. A
power outage without a sufficient back up power (e.g. UPS, generator), would have negative
impact on the County’s ability to conduct business.
2.

DOC Security Enhancements to Inmate Areas - This project will provide added security
enhancements to existing Inmate Areas at the DOC. Provide new vinyl flooring with integral
cove base, and replace/provide new cushion at walls in designated Cermak areas per DOJ request.
Provide entry card readers to existing Medical Areas. Provide new secure enclosures for battery
operated CPAP machines.

3. Skokie Courthouse ADA Holding Cell Alterations - Recent Federal Court and the Department of

Justice actions have led to required alterations in detention areas and jails. The holding cells have
not been altered since the building was built in 1980. Requirements of detainees with disabilities
have increased in recent years and the facility lacks the physical infrastructure to meet their
requirements.
4. Bridgeview Courthouse ADA Holding Cell Alterations - Recent Federal Court and the

Department of Justice actions have led to required alterations in detention areas and jails. The
holding cells have not been altered since the building was built in 1989. Requirements of
detainees with disabilities have increased in recent years and the facility lacks the physical
infrastructure to meet their requirements.
5. Markham Courthouse ADA Holding Cell Alterations - Recent Federal Court and the

Department of Justice actions have led to required alterations in detention areas and jails. The
holding cells have not been altered since the building was built in 1977. Requirements of
detainees with disabilities have increased in recent years and the facility lacks the physical
infrastructure to meet their requirements.
6. Maywood Courthouse ADA Holding Cell Alterations - Recent Federal Court and the

Department of Justice actions have led to required alterations in detention areas and jails. The
holding cells have not been altered since the building was built in 1975. Requirements of
detainees with disabilities have increased in recent years and the facility lacks the physical
infrastructure to meet their requirements.
7. Rolling Meadows Courthouse ADA Holding Cell Alterations - Recent Federal Court and the

Department of Justice actions have led to required alterations in detention areas and jails. The
holding cells have not been altered since the building was built in 1987. Requirements of

Page 45 of 192

detainees with disabilities have increased in recent years and the facility lacks the physical
infrastructure to meet their requirements.
8. Provident Hospital Boiler Tube Replacement - A recent inspection by Joint Commission on

the Accreditation of Hospitals Organization (JACO) some issues were identified that need to
be addressed. This project involves the removal and replacement of the following; remove and
replace existing pre-heat coils in 10 of the Heating Ventilating Air Conditioning units, and the
removal and replacement of the boiler tubing and the boiler tubing sheets in order to provide
proper heating, conditioning and ventilation.
9. CCAB Adult Probation Renovation - This project will renovate the existing open office space

due to significant water infiltration from Plaza leaks. Reconfiguration of the same space with
new furniture in order to accommodate 60+ new employees. The entire space will be build out
for 205 employees to meet current County Space Standards.
10. New Building-E at Oak Forest Hospital Elevator Modernization - This project will provide

upgrades to the existing elevators at New Building E at Oak Forest Hospital. The elevators are
over 25 years old, (beyond useful life) and upgrades are required to bring to current code, to
address increase in use and rectify issues with obsolete parts required for operation.
11. Stroger Hospital Pharmacy Flooring - This project will provide corrective changes to the existing

space in order to provide a safe working environment. This project estimated cost is
$225,000.
12. Countywide HH Emergency Power System Upgrade - This project consist of addressing

emergency backup power deficiencies found at various County buildings within CF-Corporate
Facilities, PS-Public Safety & HH-Health &Hospitals portfolio. Backup power and related
systems will be upgraded, and/or replaced, including UPS systems for mini-servers, generator
controls & monitoring devices, and other ancillary backup power supply devices. This project

Summary: Amend the authorized amount for the below contracts awarded for the Countywide Job Order
Contract (JOC) Program. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to
complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction project with a single, competitively bid
contract. The JOC process involved first selecting a vendor pool of potential contractors through a
competitive procurement process, and identifying projects for such selected vendors. The contractors were
found to be the lowest, responsive and responsible bidder through a competitive bid process in accordance
with the Cook County Procurement Code.
The County is under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and is only obligated to pay JOC
contractors when the construction work is procured through the JOC program. The amendment will allow
the County to extend the utilization of JOC contracts to facilitate all departments’ upcoming projects.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
In April of 2015 it became evident that the rental account would need additional funds to enable DFM to
rent essential equipment for the upkeep of facilities. On March 13 the balance was $47,632.00 as of today
the balance is $4,003.00
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
This account was chosen because of the amount of unencumbered funds.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the
account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account was chosen because of the amount of unencumbered funds. Remaining 2014 funds on preexisting purchase orders for institutional supplies (account 333) allowed for surplus.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

Per Article VII, Section 10 of the Illinois Constitution, the Illinois Intergovernmental Cooperation Act 5
ILCS 220/1 et seq., and other applicable law, units of local government are permitted to cooperate with and
support each other in exercise of their authority and the performance of their responsibilities. In addition,
per County’s Vacant Building code provisions, Oak Lawn wishes to document its position as a
“participating municipality” as authorized under the County’s Vacant Building Code.
The purpose of the Agreement is to authorize the collaboration and cooperation between the County and
Oak Lawn to enforce Cook County’s Vacant Building Code provisions within the borders of Oak Lawn
and to document and set forth the obligations of each party to the Agreement. Per the Agreement
1. The Cook County Department of Building and Zoning and its employees (“Department of Building and

boundaries.
2. The Municipality shall use its own employees to determine whether buildings within the
Municipalityare vacant and unregistered.
3. The Municipality shall provide a copy of the Notice of Violations to the Department of Building and

Zoning of any vacant and unregistered buildings within the Municipality’s borders. Said notice shall be

5. Nothing herein prevents the Municipality from establishing its own register of vacant buildings

(“Municipal Registry”) If such a Municipal Registry is duly established by the Municipality, the
Municipality will provide the County on a monthly basis in electronic form with a complete list of all
registered vacant buildings within the Municipality that were registered on the Municipal Registry
within the preceding month. Such list shall provide all relevant information required by the County for
registration of a vacant building on the County Registry, including but not limited to the name of the
person or entity that registered the building, contact information and the location of the vacant building.
The term of the Agreement shall be for two years unless otherwise extended and the Agreement may be
terminated by either party upon ninety days written notice.

government entities recommended that CDW Government LLC be awarded. The contract allows County
agencies to procure necessary software and equipment for their operational needs.
The County has since used the contract for, among other purposes, the Countywide migration to the shared
Microsoft Office 365 cloud email solution, and the purchase of several mission-critical security solutions
with grant funds earned by the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM).
To facilitate additional software purchases by DHSEM, other offices under the President, and separately
elected officials, the Bureau of Technology (BOT) and DHSEM respectfully request that this Board
approve an increase to contract number 13-28-026. The proposed increase will offset grant money
purchases made under the current limit and allow other agencies to maintain their normal pace of spending
under the competitive volume pricing discounts. A corresponding amendment will reduce the mark-up cost
for any newly added software items.

PUBLIC DEFENDER

Presented by: AMY CAMPANELLI, Public Defender of Cook County
PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Public Defender
Request: We are requesting to transfer money from our Expert Witness account to our Maintenance
account
Reason: When the FY2015 budget was created, a maintenance contract for Legal Edge was overlooked.
From Account(s): 260-264, $19,810.00
To Account(s): 260-441, $19,810.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $19,810.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It was determined that the account would need an infusion of funds on 3/17/2015 in order to meet current
obligations. The balance in the account was $26,000 on 3/17/2015 and was $26,000 30 days prior to that
date.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
We currently predict a slight surplus in our Expert Witness account. Our Office Supply account was also
considered, but it was determined that we will be spending at or just below our appropriation.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the
account that funds are transferred from.
There will be no projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred, delayed,
or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority to our Expert Witness account.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The account was budgeted based on past fiscal years expenditures. It is very hard to determine the exact
amount of Expert Witness costs that will be needed each year.

A motion was made by Commissioner García, seconded by Commissioner Boykin, that this Transfer
of Funds be approved. The motion carried.

LARRY SUFFREDIN AND JEFFREY R. TOBOLSKI, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
RESOLUTION
PROTECTING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND
SUPPORTING INCREASED FUNDING LEVELS
WHEREAS, women need access to safe, affordable, and comprehensive reproductive health care
throughout their lives, including screening for cancer and sexually transmitted infections, contraceptive
services, abortion care, prenatal care, and labor and delivery services; and
WHEREAS, reproductive health is a vital component of a woman’s overall health, and reproductive
freedom is vital to a woman’s safety, well-being, and ability to participate equally in society; and
WHEREAS, on January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a historic and landmark decision, ruled in
Roe v. Wade that the U.S. Constitution safeguards a woman’s ability to make her own personal medical
decisions about when or whether to have children; and
WHEREAS, that decision has allowed women to participate more fully in society, saved lives, and
strengthened families and we must always guard against efforts to deliberately erode the availability and
affordability of abortion and undermine the protections provided by Roe v. Wade; and
WHEREAS, the majority of Americans continue to support safe, legal abortion; and
WHEREAS, federal and state laws that place obstacles in the paths of women seeking abortion care take
away the ability of those women to make decisions and threaten the health of families; and
WHEREAS, one such restriction is the Hyde Amendment, passed by Congress on September 30, 1976,
which for nearly 39 years has impeded access to abortion care for low-income women enrolled in Medicaid;
and
WHEREAS, Medicaid coverage for abortion care has a significant effect on low-income women’s ability
to decide to end an unwanted pregnancy, and in the absence of such coverage many women are unable to
obtain an abortion; and
WHEREAS, many women in Cook County, including state and federal employees, obtain insurance
coverage through other public insurance programs that also restrict coverage for abortion; and
WHEREAS, all women should have insurance coverage for comprehensive reproductive health care,
including abortion care, to ensure that their economic status or the source of their insurance coverage does
not affect important health care decisions or access; and
WHEREAS, millions of women nationally, and hundreds of thousands in Illinois and Cook County, are

Page 90 of 192

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 29, 2015

subject to these inequitable policies; and
WHEREAS, public health insurance should cover all of a woman’s options when she is facing an
unintended pregnancy, so that she is able to make a real decision about what is best for her and her family;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County provides important support for many women to ensure that they have access to
comprehensive reproductive health care, including abortion, but regardless of the resources dedicated by
Cook County, bans on coverage for abortion continue to harm many women; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that funding of comprehensive reproductive health care be increased and that
abortion be covered as part of comprehensive reproductive health care in all public insurance programs to
ensure that services are accessible for women who are enrolled in such programs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County call upon federal and state elected officials to maintain the protections
established by Roe v. Wade for access to comprehensive reproductive health care and undo restrictions that
have been placed on those protections; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County call for increased federal and state funding for comprehensive reproductive health care and to
reinstate coverage for abortion services for women enrolled in public insurance programs.
Approved and adopted this 29th of April 2015.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE CREATION OF LOCAL RIGHT TO WORK ZONES IN ILLINOIS
WHEREAS, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner has repeatedly called for the creation of local right to work
zones, in which voters could decide if workers in their communities employed in unionized industries can
opt out of paying dues to labor organizations; and
WHEREAS, Governor Rauner has asked for city councils across Illinois to consider a resolution asking for
voter referendums to allow local right to work zones, as well as changes to prevailing wage laws and worker
compensation laws; and
WHEREAS, such action has the potential to further dismantle unionized labor organizations, which have
historically protected the rights of working and middle-class Illinoisans and could lead to lower wages,
reduced benefits, and poor working conditions for employees whether they are union or non-union; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan released an opinion last week unequivocally declaring
that the concept of local right to work zones presented by Governor Rauner would violate the National
Labor Relations Act (NLRA); and
WHEREAS, the Attorney General opinion additionally states that “counties and municipalities, whether
home rule or non-home-rule, as well as all other political subdivisions, units of local government, and
school districts of this State, are precluded by federal law from enacting ordinances and resolutions that
limit or restrict the use of union security agreements. Further, current law does not authorize the creation,
through the passage of a referendum, of “right to work” zones or local areas wherein union security
agreements will not be recognized.”; and
WHEREAS, although Illinois courts have not had to address this matter previously, courts of other
jurisdictions and other state Attorneys General that have opined on the matter have uniformly concluded
that the NLRA preempts the prohibition of union security agreements by units of local government in all
instances relating to interstate commerce and that the lone exception to federal preemption authorizes only
states and territories, and not their political subdivisions, to prohibit union security agreements; and
WHEREAS, this latest attack on collective bargaining is an attempt to weaken organized labor and will not
make Illinois a more competitive business environment, evidenced by the fact that similar laws in other
states have had no significant impact on attracting employers to a particular state;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby opposes
the proposal to create local right to work zones in Illinois as such action would violate current federal and
state laws and would negatively impact collective bargaining and hurt hard-working middle-class
employees and their families in Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in light of the current federal and Illinois laws, the Cook County
Board of Commissioners urges local government subdivisions within Cook County to refrain from
considering and adopting resolutions asking the Illinois Legislature to allow local right to work zones.

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE CREATION OF LOCAL RIGHT TO
WORK ZONES IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner has repeatedly called for the creation of local right to work
zones, in which voters could decide if workers in their communities employed in unionized industries can
opt out of paying dues to labor organizations; and
WHEREAS, Governor Rauner has asked for local governments across Illinois to consider a resolution
asking for voter referendums to allow local right to work zones; and
WHEREAS, such action has the potential to further dismantle unionized labor organizations, which have
historically protected the rights of working and middle-class Illinoisans and could lead to lower wages,
reduced benefits, and poor working conditions for employees whether they are union or non-union; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan released an opinion last week unequivocally declaring
that the concept of local right to work zones presented by Governor Rauner would violate the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA); and
WHEREAS, the Attorney General opinion additionally states that “counties and municipalities, whether
home rule or non-home-rule, as well as all other political subdivisions, units of local government, and school
districts of this State, are precluded by federal law from enacting ordinances and resolutions that limit or
restrict the use of union security agreements. Further, current law does not authorize the creation, through
the passage of a referendum, of “right to work” zones or local areas wherein union security agreements will
not be recognized.”; and
WHEREAS, although Illinois courts have not had to address this matter previously, courts of other
jurisdictions and other state Attorneys General that have opined on the matter have uniformly concluded
that the NLRA preempts the prohibition of union security agreements by units of local government in all

Illinois House of Representatives, the President of the Illinois Senate and to the Governor of Illinois.
