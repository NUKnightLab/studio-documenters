STAFF REPORT 5-8-2019 MEETING
PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6169
ADDRESS: 632 (634) PRENTIS AVE.
HISTORIC DISTRICT: WARREN-PRENTIS
APPLICANT: MICHAEL THOMPSON / THOMPSON DESIGN GROUP
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 05-02-2019
PROPOSAL
The building located at 632 Prentis is a multi-family apartment building, located mid-block on the north
side of Prentis Street. It was built in 1908. The building exhibits Neo-Classical architectural detailing. The
symmetrical, red brick façade features quoins at the corners of the building and around the doors and
windows on the front façade. Limestone sills and headers are found on all windows. The front door
features a transom and sidelights. The roof is flat behind the Italianate bracketed cornice. The 2-story
covered porch is a character defining feature marked by (2) fluted columns and a detailed cornice that
includes Italianate brackets and dentils. The lower porch supports the columns with limestone capped brick
piers and limestone capped brick wing walls that flank the porch and stairway. The porch includes a
second-tier deck that is supported by the columns surrounded by a balustrade railing. There is a small
landscaped area in the front yard that fronts on the sidewalk / right-of-way.
The applicant is redeveloping the building into eight condominium units. With the current proposal, the
applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to complete the following work associated with the overall
rehabilitation of the building as per the attached drawings:
•
•
•
•
•
•

New concrete pavement at the rear of the building to accommodate (5) parking spaces; replaces
existing gravel lot
Remove and rebuild the existing rear wood deck (alley side)
Remove and rebuild existing basement access stairway
Add new HVAC system / Condensers on to roof
o Including screening, not visible from primary view corridor
Conversion of 2nd’ and 3rd floor doorways to porch to “Windows” by removing hardware so
they are non-operational
Painting: Porch, trim and sash from Color Chart- C

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
After a review of the submission, staff proffers the following opinions/ observations regarding the scope of the work/
current proposal:

Construct a paved parking area in rear yard to alley for five (5) vehicles
The applicant has provided a proposed site plan that will allow each unit to have a parking space. The
applicant has proposed a 4” concrete slab that will drain away from the building toward the alleyway. The
current parking area is gravel.
Staff finds that this work is appropriate under Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation,
number 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be

 REPORT

compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the
property and its environment.
Remove and rebuild the existing rear wood deck (alley side)
The applicant has proposed demolishing the existing rear stairway and rebuilding the deck as shown on the
provided plans. Based on photos, staff feels that the existing deck is not original.
The proposed deck and stairs will have a similar look to the existing deck structure but will be
reconfigured to so that a central stairway will separate balcony areas for each unit.
Staff finds that this work is appropriate under Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation, number 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not
destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from
the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the
historic integrity of the property and its environment.
Remove and rebuild existing basement access stairway
The applicant has stated that the existing stairway leading to the basement is deteriorating and does not
meet current building codes. It will be replaced by a cast-in-place concrete stairway that will comply to
current building codes. Staff finds that this work is appropriate under Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
for Rehabilitation, number 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not
destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old
and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
Adding new HVAC system w/ rooftop condensers
To modernize the heating and cooling system in the building, eight condensers will be added to the roof of
the building. The condensers have been positioned in a location that will not be visible from the primary
view corridor on Prentis Street.
Additionally, the condensers will utilize an architectural screen that will shield them from the upper
level views of adjacent buildings.
Staff finds that this work is appropriate under Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation, number 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not
destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the
old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the
historic integrity of the property and its environment.
Conversion of functional second and third floor doorways at porch to non-functional “windows”
The front porch decks will no longer be accessible for residents. Therefore, the majority glass doorways
will have hardware removed and function as fenestration for the foyer at the interior stairway.
Staff finds that this work is appropriate under Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation, number 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not
destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the
old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the
historic integrity of the property and its environment.
Painting
All proposed colors are in accordance with HDC approved Color Chart “C”.
Staff finds that this work is appropriate under Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation, number 6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of

 REPORT

deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence.

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Porch and entrance types relate to the type and style of the
building. On residential streetscapes, projecting porches are major elements; when in a row they create a
rhythmic progression along the street. Entrances on multi-story apartment buildings generally do not
project; they frequently recede into the facade and have no consistent placement from one building to the
next. Consequently, a strong rhythm is not created. Where commercial buildings line the streets in
numbers, an irregular rhythm is created by multiple entrances.

(7)

Relationship of materials. The majority of residential buildings are faced with brick, often combined with
masonry and/or wooden trim, architectural elements and details. The house at 110 West Forest Avenue is
the only wood frame building in the district. Many storefronts of brick commercial buildings have large
plate glass windows. The majority of roofs visible from the street are covered in asphalt, but slate exists;
the roof of Detroit Central High School (now “Old Main”) is metal, while its balconies are bronze.
Wrought iron balconets and railings ornament several apartment buildings. Tile is used on the Goodrich
Building at 4809 Woodward Avenue.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The major textural relationship is that of brick laid in mortar, often juxtaposed
with wood and/or smooth, carved or molded cast stone elements and trim. Textured brick and brick laid
in patterns creates considerable interest where it exists. Slate roofs have particular textural values where
they exist, as does the metal roof of Detroit Central High School (now “Old Main”). Asphalt shingles
generally have little textural interest, even in those types which purport to imitate some other variety.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (such as red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall
surfaces. Natural stone colors also exist, including gray, beige, brown and red. Roofs, the majority of
which are asphalt shingle, are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, natural and stained wood colors).
Paint colors often relate to style. The buildings derived from classical precedents, particularly those of
colonial revival, neo-colonial and renaissance revival styles, generally have woodwork painted white,
cream, or in the range of those colors. Colors known to have been in use on similar buildings of this style
in the eighteenth or early twentieth centuries may be considered for appropriateness. Buildings of
vernacular english revival styles generally have painted woodwork and window frames of a dark brown or
cream color. Victorian buildings display a broad color palette. Tile and stained glass, where it exists as
decoration visible on the front facade, contributes to the artistic interest of the building. The original
colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that building,
and may provide guidance for similar buildings.

(10)

Relationship of architectural details. The architectural elements and details of each structure generally
relate to its style. Some individual buildings within the Warren - Prentis historic district represent the
pinnacle of period styles - the Richardsonian Romanesque central high school (now “Old Main”); the neoclassical Church of Christ, Scientist; the neo-gothic First Unitarian-Universalist Church; the
italianate/second empire Thompson Home for Old Ladies; the colonial revival Butler House; and the early
modern/arts and crafts Children’s Aid Society. Characteristic of late victorian period houses are multiple
roof shapes and wall planes, a variety of textural and coloristic effects, and decorative wooden elements.
Apartment buildings are generally rich in stylistic detail in either cast stone or wood; porches, window
frames, cornices, and dormer windows are commonly, although not always, treated. Characteristic
elements and details displayed on vernacular english revival-influenced buildings include arched windows

 REPORT
and door openings, steeply pitched gables, and towers. Artistic touches, including stained glass and tile,
provide artistic decoration. Prairie and arts and crafts style buildings feature wide porches and
overhangs. Commercial buildings along woodward avenue, cass avenue, third avenue and warren avenue
range in style from neo-georgian to art deco and art moderne. Buildings constructed for religious
purposes include the late gothic revival First Unitarian-Universalist Church; the neo-classical revival First
Church of Christ, Scientist (Hilberry Theater); and the english revival style Berea Tabernacle (Greater
King Solomon Baptist Church). In general, the district is rich in late victorian architectural styles, late
nineteenth and early twentieth century revival stylistic expressions of the modern movement.
(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. The Warren - Prentis historic district is primarily composed of residential
buildings displaying a variety of roof shapes relating to style. Common are the use of multiple roof
shapes over victorian houses. Commercial buildings throughout the district, as well as many two-to-four
unit dwellings and apartment buildings, have flat roofs that are not visible from the street. However,
several apartment buildings bear parapet walls with stylistic elements, such as gables and decorative
pediments, creating interesting silhouettes. Detroit Central High School (now “Old Main”) has a hipped
roof with a pyramidal roofed tower, multiple gables, and spires projecting from the roof.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Front facades of buildings range from completely symmetrical to
asymmetrical, depending on architectural style. A great variety of architectural styles and building types exist
within the district, although most are classically inspired and, thus, tend to be symmetrical.

(22)

General environmental character. The Warren - Prentis historic district is a dense, urban, mixed use
district primarily composed of residential structures but also containing commercial, institutional, and
religious buildings as well as vacant land. Its buildings reflects the area’s development as one of rapid
growth, intensification of land use, sudden decline and recent revitalization. The vitality of the district is a
result of the mixture of uses and the correspondingly diverse physical appearance of its architectural
resources. Its proximity to Wayne State University, the cultural center, and the Detroit Medical Center
result in its being a locus for human activity.

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the proposed alterations are appropriate and will not adversely effect any of the building’s
defining historical features. The proposed modifications in the rear of the property will not be visible from Second
Street and will not detract from the building’s historic appearance. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission
issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed project because the work meets the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation Numbers 6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than

replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature
shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence,
and 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials
that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible
with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and
its environment.

Motion DRAFT

I move that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work items proposed in
application number 19-6169 because the work as described does meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for

COLOR SYSTEM C
As the nineteenth-century waned, American domestic architecture began to return to simpler lines
inspired in part by our colonial past. With this revival paint colors also changed. Body colors moved
towards the pastels; white again became the most popular trim color and was even used for sash. This
trend developed in the I 890s, but only for colonial and classically inspired houses; the darker colors
found in the High and Late Victorian Styles continued to be popular and it would inappropriate to use
the colonial colors listed for houses not in the Colonial Revival style. Knowledge of true colonial col­
ors was primitive in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The so-called "Williamsburg" dark reds,
uniform blues and greens that resulted from early studies to discover colors used in the colonial era
were actually decades in the future.
For the stucco or clapboard, frame colonial, yellow was the most popular body color, although gray or
blue was used. Normally these were then trimmed with white or ivory on the cornice, cornerboards,
window frames, sash, etc., depending on which gave the lesser contrast. The yellow, gray and blue
were less often used as trimming colors for masonry houses where the darker red brick or stone usu­
ally was accompanied by white or ivory trim and dark green shutters.
