CHAIRMAN’S REPORT
Chairman Madigan shared that she received many positive comments from the field
regarding the Illinois Arts Council Agency’s panel review process held in the spring
and summer. She commended the staff and the Board for their excellent work. She
also reported that the auditors were in the process of a biennial review of Illinois Arts
Council Agency’s records. Chairman Madigan noted that Rhoda Pierce had recently
chaired the Arts Midwest’s Transition Committee to replace long-time President and
CEO, David Fraher, who retired after 37 years of service. As a result of the committee’s
hard work, Mr. Torrie Allen, former director of development at the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival, has accepted the position. Chairman Madigan then shared sad
news about the passing of three former staff members, Desmond duMont, Richard
Carlson and Walter Buford. All three provided excellent service during their time with
the Illinois Arts Council Agency and they will be missed.

 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
Executive Director Joshua Davis announced that Fiscal Year 2019 was a very successful
year. The Illinois Arts Council Agency relaunched the Artist Fellowship Awards and
the Literary Awards Programs, receiving over 600 applications from the field. He
noted that the strategic planning process is continuing with the completion of a
significant number of one-on-one interviews performed with organizations throughout
the state. Illinois Arts Council Agency staff members were also surveyed. In the
coming weeks, 1,800 Illinois Arts Council Agency grantees will receive an online survey
seeking their input for the Strategic Plan. Fiscal year 2020 has started off well with the
completion of panel reviews of Program Grant applications. Other significant Illinois
Arts Council Agency accomplishments include: the transition to the Department of
Innovation and Technology and to the Enterprise Resource Planning system. Moving
forward, areas of focus will include working to transition to the Grants Accountability
& Transparency Unit and replacing the Illinois Arts Council Agency’s current grants
management system.
It was moved by Rhoda Pierce and seconded that the Illinois Arts Council Agency,
having completed its scheduled business, be adjourned. The motion carried.
