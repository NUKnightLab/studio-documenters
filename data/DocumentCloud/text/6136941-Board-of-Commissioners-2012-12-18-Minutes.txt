PROPOSED RESOLUTION
DEDICATION OF THE SPECIALTY CARE ATRIUM ENTRANCE
AT JOHN H. STROGER, JR. HOSPITAL IN THE NAME OF THE
HONORABLE RICHARD J. PHELAN
WHEREAS, in 1990, the residents of Cook County elected a political newcomer, Richard J.
Phelan, to the office of President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, President Phelan accomplished a remarkable number of things during his four
(4) year term from 1990 to 1994, especially in the area of the County’s healthcare system;
and
WHEREAS, under President Phelan’s stewardship,
the modernization and
professionalization of the County’s financial management was successfully undertaken;
President Phelan created both the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and the Office of
Capital Planning; under President Phelan, Cook County received its first independent audit by
an outside accounting firm in more than a decade and received its first Certificate of
Achievement Award for Excellence in Financial Reporting from the Government Financial
Officers Association; President Phelan inaugurated the County’s first ¾ cent sales tax,
thereby reducing the County’s reliance on property taxes and diversifying the County’s tax
base; and
WHEREAS, under President Phelan’s watch, strides were made in the area of ethical
government; the first Ethics and Human Resources Ordinances were signed; and Cook
County signed on to the Shakman Decree, which for the first time explicitly prohibited
political hiring and firing; and
WHEREAS, under President Phelan’s leadership, a Human Rights Ordinance extended
employment and other protections to members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender (LGBT) community, and Cook County’s Minority- and Women-Owned
Business Enterprise Ordinance was strengthened; and
WHEREAS, in the area of public safety, President Phelan successfully championed the
creation of the first County-wide assault weapons ban and undertook expansion of the
capacity of the Cook County Jail; and
WHEREAS, certainly, President Phelan’s most significant achievements were in the area of
healthcare and moving the County closer to the goal of achieving equality in healthcare for all
County residents; when President Phelan took office, the elements of the Cook County
healthcare system were uncoordinated, the nearly 80-year-old Cook County Hospital had just
been disaccredited, and the replacement of the hospital was opposed by the business
community, hospital organizations, the newspaper editorial boards and a sizable number of
County Board Commissioners; under President Phelan’s leadership, a new “Bureau of Health
Services” was established to coordinate the County’s acute care, ambulatory care and long
term care services under the command of its first Bureau Chief, Ruth M. Rothstein,
accreditation was restored, the planning, sizing and budgeting for a replacement hospital were
established, the business, hospital and newspaper opponents of the replacement hospital were

won over, and the Cook County Board authorized the commitment of funding, all of which
culminated in the State’s award (on President Phelan’s last day in office) of a “certificate of
need” authorizing construction of the state of the art Stroger Hospital of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, also in the area of healthcare, President Phelan oversaw the establishment of the
CORE Foundation partnership with Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Medical Center, which led
to the building of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center, opened the renovated Provident
Hospital as a Cook County facility, authorized the expansion of women’s reproductive health
services at Cook County Hospital, and established the first Inter-Governmental Transfer
Agreement with the State of Illinois, which has resulted in more than a billion dollars in extra
Medicaid revenues for the County since its execution; and
WHEREAS, the Specialty Care Atrium Entrance of Stroger Hospital of Cook County is
being re-conceptualized and upgraded to create a more healing environment and entryway
utilizing the elements of water, vegetation, light, art and sound; and
WHEREAS, it is altogether fitting and appropriate that the many contributions of President
Phelan to the improvement of Cook County, but especially the healthcare system of Cook
County, be recognized in the building he worked so hard to see become a reality during his
term as Cook County Board President.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
hereby congratulates the Honorable Richard J. Phelan upon the dedication of the Stroger
Hospital of Cook County Specialty Care Atrium Entrance in his name, thanks him for his
years of outstanding leadership and service on behalf of the residents of Cook County, and

BUREAU OF FINANCE, OFFICE OF THE COUNTY COMPTROLLER.
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 4, 2012 from Reshma Soni, Comptroller
and Juliana Stratton, Director, Justice Advisory Council.
Re: 2002 Grant Agreement between the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts and
Cook County Judicial Advisory Council - Approval of payment in the amount of $599,532.99
to the State.
On May 21, 2002 the Cook County Board of Commissioners authorized the Judicial
Advisory Council (“JAC”) to accept a grant award in the amount of $1,500,000.00 from the
Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts (“AOIC”) for operational improvements for the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (“JTDC”). The 2002 Grant Agreement (“Grant
Agreement”) approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners and executed by Cook
County started on June 14, 2002 and ended on June 13, 2004. A grant extension was
requested by Cook County in May of 2004; however, said request was formally denied on
June 1, 2004.
Per the Grant Agreement, JTDC submitted a Final Status Report in August of 2004 to the
AOIC Court Services Division; the Final Status Report noted that $219,458.00 remained in
unexpended grant funds. As of this date, neither JTDC nor Cook County has refunded the
unexpended grant funds owed to the State of Illinois.
Following the Final Status Report, the Supreme Court Internal Audit Division conducted an
audit of the grant between JTDC and AOIC to determine if JTDC expended State grant funds
in compliance with the Grant Agreement. The scope of the audit was limited to reviewing
expenditures made under the grant award for the grant period beginning June 14, 2002
through June 13, 2004. Per the results of the audit, it was determined that $301,502.54
remained unexpended and $298,030.45 was disallowed. (AOIC Audit determined that
$180,075.00 in expenditures were made outside the grant award period, 98,755.45 in

80

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 18, 2012
expenditures were made without supporting documentation, and $19,200 in expenditures
were charged to other accounts/grants; said charges represent a total of $298,030.45 is
disallowed costs.) The total amount to be refunded to the State from the Grant Agreement
was determined to be $599,532.99.
JTDC attempted to address and refute the AOIC Audit findings on June 29 and August 7,
2006; however, on February 1, 2007 the AOIC auditors confirmed to JTDC that the grant
award was not expended in compliance with the Grant Agreement and in accordance with the
Illinois Grant Funds Recovery Act, $599,532.99 was to be returned to the AOIC,
Administrative Services Division by March 5, 2007; additional attempts to recover said funds
had gone unanswered by Cook County.
In November of 2011, representatives of the AOIC met with County representatives to
address the outstanding funds owed to the State under the Illinois Grant Recovery Act. For
the time period of December, 2011 through February, 2012, representatives from the Justice
Advisory Council (formerly known as the Judicial Advisory Council), Budget, Comptroller’s
Office and the President’s Office engaged in research, reviewed documents and met with
AOIC representatives and auditors in an attempt to present documentation to dispute some of
the AOIC audit findings from 2006.
In February of 2012, Cook County provided documentation in an attempt to support the
County’s 2006 position that $294,305.00 of the $599,532.99 in grant funds expended by the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center represented allowable costs under the Grant
Agreement. Despite the materials provided by Cook County, in April of 2012, AOIC
confirmed its prior conclusion that the total amount of grant funds not expended in
compliance with the Grant Agreement remained at $599,532.99.
During a second conference in August of 2012, Cook County sought reconsideration of the
AOIC’s position and offered supporting facts to justify the expenditure of certain items from
the 2002 Grant Agreement. Following an additional conference in August of 2012, Cook
County narrowed its request for review before the AOIC and requested additional review of
approximately $121,000.00 in expenditures that were charged to the Grant Agreement.
On November 5, 2012 the AOIC notified Cook County that it has reviewed Cook County’s
position and supporting documentation but confirmed its position that $599,532.99 remains
due to the State.
Upon review of the AOIC’s decision and supporting documentation, authorization is hereby
requested for the Comptroller to remit the unexpended grant funds to the State in the amount
of $301,502.54 from account 7700201.440400.300 and the $298,030.45 in disallowed costs
from the 4991619.580030 account.
