on Pension Investments that were conducted on November 18-19, 2015. She stated that the
Committee focused on brokerage, diversity initiatives and alternative investments. The
questions from the Committee at the hearing frequently related to hedge fund investments,
but the questionnaire the Committee requested the Fund to complete prior to the hearing was
comprehensive addressing all areas of investment plan activities. There was some indication
from the Committee that it may convene the hearings twice a year.

excellent presentation. She suggested that other trustees attend future hearings.
4. Health Benefits Committee Update
a. Open Enrollment
The Executive Director provided a recap of the Open Enrollment meetings highlighting the
successful outreach at the four different venues. Fund staff worked diligently to identify
cost-effective venues that were conveniently located for the annuitants. The number of
members attending the meetings tripled over attendance in the prior year at the same total
cost. Brenda Deming, Director of Health Benefits, stated that the focus of the meetings was
to assist members in managing their health issues and that the members’ positive response to
this strategy was very strong.
5. 2016 Finance Report
a. 2016 Budget Approval
The Executive Director presented an overview of the 2016 Budget for the Fund. She noted
that the current investment environment is more challenging and that the costs of benefit
payments will continue to rise because the number of annuitants is increasing and the
annuitants are living longer. She stated that the Fund had successes in 2015 notably with the
administration and cost management of health benefits, the ongoing records management and
digitization and the improvements to the Fund’s information systems controls.

 Michael Maratea, Director of Finance and Administration, reported that improvements to the
information systems, which were made in response to problems identified by external audits,
increased the systems’ functionality and security. He anticipated that more such
improvements would be made in 2016. The trustees asked that they be advised of the status
of external audits and Fund staff concurred.
The Fund’s staff stated that it would recommend the retention of the relationships with its
custodian bank, BNY/Mellon, and its auditor, Legacy Professionals, LLP, because the
service levels received from these providers were good and the proposed fees were very
competitive for the services to be rendered. BNY/Mellon had proposed a fee structure for
the next five years to the Fund for their custodial services through December 31, 2020.
Callan Associates, the Fund’s Investment Consultant, conducted a blind request for
information on behalf of the Fund to ascertain if the proposed custodial fees were reasonable
and concluded that the custodian’s proposed fees were below market rates.
The fees proposed by Legacy for the audits in 2015 and 2016 were the same as had been paid
for the 2014 audit and the fees for the audits for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 were
modestly higher. A trustee requested explanation for renewal with Legacy since the last bid
was considered. The Executive Director explained that the Fund evaluates the stability of
team, resident expertise, fees, value added servces prior to presenting a recommendation
outside of a bidding situation. Legacy routinely performed critical services and reviews as
needed beyond the scope of the agreement. The trustees discussed the comparison of
projected expenses to actual expenses for 2015. The actual expenses for 2015 will not be
known late in the first quarter of 2016 and will be made available to the trustees at that time.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode, consistent with the
recommendations of the Fund’s staff, that the Fiscal Year 2016 Administrative Budget be
adopted.

In the presentation of the 2016 budget, it was discussed that the Fund would need to prepare
an RFP for a pension benefit system. In an effort to control costs, Fund staff proposed the
retention of a Business Analyst to provide needed technical expertise to prepare the RFP.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Fund retain an
external Business Analyst at a cost not to exceed $35,000 to assist Fund staff in the
preparation and review of a Request for Proposal for a pension benefit system as presented.
It was further moved that Fund staff shall take all action reasonably necessary to effectuate
the foregoing including the execution and delivery of any related written agreement on behalf
of the Fund by the Executive Director.
