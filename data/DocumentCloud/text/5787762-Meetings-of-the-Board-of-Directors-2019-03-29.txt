Environmental Scan of Market, Best Practices and Trends
Observations
• Expansion of uninsured due to changes at Federal and State levels
• Continued decline in admissions, more ambulatory care, including home care
• Increased capture of Medicaid Admission (MA) activity at other hospitals
• Innovations in health care delivery, e.g. retail pharmacy & insurers – reducing out of pocket expenses –
important for low income
• Continued growth of care provided in MCOs – focused on screening, early interventions
• Consumer demands for online access to care, providers – 24x7
• Increasing focus on mitigating impact social determinants on achieving health goals at the individual level
• Expanded use of advanced practice clinicians, (Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, Midwives)
• Increased use of technology in direct care and to keep patients engaged
