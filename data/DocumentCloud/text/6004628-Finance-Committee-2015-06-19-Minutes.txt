III. Action Items (continued)
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Review of all of the requests by Contract Compliance has not yet been completed; it was respectfully requested
that the Committee conditionally approve these requests, pending the completion of review by Contract
Compliance.
During the discussion of request number 11, Mr. Elwell stated that this is a one year contract; it is the
administration’s intention to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for these services - they tried to identify a
vendor through the RFP process twice now, but could not find a vendor large enough that could deliver all the
services. Board Chairman Hammock inquired whether it is the transportation broker’s responsibility to ensure
that the service providers are Medicaid-certified. Mr. Elwell stated that, under the proposed contract, this is
the broker’s responsibility.
Mr. Elwell noted that, in the future, the transmittals will be changed to make them more transparent on a
couple of issues; based on Chairman Collens’ recommendations, a column will be added to reflect the total
number of bidders for contracts.
With regard to the sole source contract with Polymedco Cancer Diagnostic Products, LLC, Mr. Elwell stated
that this contract is for the provision of test kits that will replace doing screening colonoscopies; just like every
major public hospital in the country, CCHHS is behind in doing screening colonoscopies, because there are
just not enough doctors to be doing just screenings. The test kit is sent out, returned and sampled; the sample
will tell whether further testing is needed. At this point, this vendor is the only one with this technology that
has been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA); another vendor is expected to be approved by
the FDA within the next three to six months, which will provide some competition. Dr. John Jay Shannon,
Chief Executive Officer, stated that the total run cost for the whole test is less than $100; he noted that that
there will be some wastage, because some kits will be sent out and never returned.
With regard to the sole source contract with Smith Medical Partners, Mr. Elwell stated that the System uses a
number of different types of birth control; this is a particular type of IUD, and there is only one vendor for it.
In response to a question from Director Velasquez regarding the unit price, Mr. Elwell indicated that he will
provide that information.
Board Chairman Hammock, seconded by Chairman Collens, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 22, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (continued)
Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the Report. Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided
an overview of the information contained in the CountyCare Update. The Committee reviewed and discussed
the information.
Mr. Elwell noted that CCHHS’ budget is calculated on a semi-cash basis, without depreciation. Board
Chairman Hammock requested that the budget be referred to and discussed exclusively as being calculated on
an accrual basis; this will avoid confusion, as it is hard to juggle the differences between cash- and accrualbasis when discussing the budget.
Mr. Elwell provided information on some predictions relating to the potential state shutdown and how it will
affect CCHHS. Historically, when the State has faced a shutdown, it has only happened for a day or two; in
instances when the shutdown went longer than a couple of days, continuing appropriations were approved.
The administration thinks that there is a very good chance that there will not be continuing appropriations
agreed to. What this could potentially mean to CCHHS is there may not be a July CountyCare payment made
to CCHHS; however, CCHHS will be obligated to pay its vendors for their July work, based on their contracts
with the vendors. He noted that the State is still obligated to pay CCHHS, but there may be a cash-flow
hiccup. To try to stem that, the administration is working to try to expedite appropriation of a payment due to
CCHHS that is primarily federal; it is normally received in August, but the administration is trying to get it
appropriated before June 30th.
Director Velasquez inquired regarding the impending U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding Affordable Care
Act subsidies; she asked how that decision will affect CCHHS. Mr Elwell stated that it is a concern, and is
also a non-concern. CCHHS is in a unique position. Many of the individuals who are getting those subsidies
are not choosing to receive services at CCHHS right now; if that population would lose their insurance, they
would come back to CCHHS - this would increase the self-pay population. Although decreases in self-pay
patients may typically be considered desirable, a decrease in that population can negatively impact how much
disproportionate share (DSH) money CCHHS can qualify for. Normally, this is not something to worry about,
because in the past, CCHHS has provided so much more charity care than what was paid back to it through the
DSH program; now this subject is being closely monitored by the administration.
During the discussion of strategic opportunities, with regard to Pediatrics, Director Gugenheim indicated that
she would like to see lead poisoning as a subject for further review and discussion. Mr. Elwell responded
affirmatively; he noted that, in the past, most of the things in this area have been done in a reactive manner.
CCHHS has an advantage as a health system; by using its public health data, it knows where most of the lead
is located and can be more active in that area.
With regard to the CountyCare report, Board Chairman Hammock referenced comments made earlier by
Chairman Collens regarding how CountyCare may be losing members. He asked whether the number of
members who did not redetermine during that month could be deducted from the total number of members lost
for the month, to find the number of members who voluntarily chose to leave CountyCare. Mr. Glass
responded that it may be a little more complicated to reach that answer, but he will see what he can do to
narrow it down.

IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (continued)
Director Velasquez inquired regarding the status of bringing some of the services relating to redeterminations
in-house. Mr. Elwell stated that there are two groups coming in. One group is the replacement for services
provided by staff from Chamberlin Edmonds & Associates; approximately 40 of the 88 staff have been
brought in. The other group relates to the call center activities; that staff is being brought in but have not taken
over that process yet. It is expected that the call center activities will be taken in-house on July 31st; there will
be a two-week parallel period with the current vendor. Additionally, Mr. Elwell noted that the administration
is planning to issue an RFP for outreach services in July.
There were no emergency purchases to report at this time.
Board Chairman Hammock, seconded by Chairman Collens, moved to receive and file
the four (4) reports under Section IV. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
