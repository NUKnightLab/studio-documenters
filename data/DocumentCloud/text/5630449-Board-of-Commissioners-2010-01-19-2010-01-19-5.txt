 GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Office of Development Management (“ODM”) solicited from qualified owner’s
representatives and/or construction management firms to serve as the Chicago Housing
Authority’s (“CHA’s”) Representative (“Owner’s Representative” or “OR”) as it undertakes
capital construction and rehabilitation activities of a 1923 apartment building, Pomeroy
Apartments. Once completed, it will return one hundred four (104) public housing opportunities
to the CHA’s senior citizen community and one (1) manager’s unit. To accomplish this task, the
CHA sought full service owner’s representatives and/or construction management firms
(“Respondents”) to provide all necessary construction management activities related to such
capital construction and rehabilitation, including, but not limited to, scheduling, coordination,
consultation, administration, change order facilitation, claim and dispute consultation and close-out
of Pomeroy Apartments (the “Project”). Following the completed interior demolition, the
renovation work required in this nine (9) story building will include all upgrades needed to meet
local codes and ADA accessibility compliance.

The CHA currently owns Pomeroy Apartments, a public senior housing building located at 1039
West Hollywood Avenue in Chicago (the “Property”). The CHA intends to transfer ownership
of the Property to a limited liability entity (the “Owner”). The Owner will be comprised of a
Limited Partner (99.991%) represented by a private tax credit investor and a General Partner
limited liability entity (.009%) of which CHA will be the sole member. Upon closing of the
transfer of the Property to the Owner, the CHA will transfer the construction contract and the
Owner’s Representative contract to the Owner. The Property will be redeveloped as a mixedfinanced project. CHA will provide collateral for a construction loan and fund a permanent loan,
and leverage additional project funding including equity from Low Income Housing Tax Credits.
As the General Partner, the CHA will facilitate the transaction and operate the project as public
housing.
The CHA will award a firm fixed price owner’s representative contract to the OR per Request for
Proposal (“RFP”) No. 09-00430. The OR will be expected to provide all necessary construction
management activities related to such capital construction and rehabilitation, including, but not
limited to, scheduling, coordination, consultation, administration, change order facilitation, claim
and dispute consultation and close-out of the assigned project. This work will continue until the
scope of work is completed, which is expected to be within 24 months of the date set forth in the
Notice to Proceed.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised RFP No. 09-00430 for the Owner’s Representative Services of Pomeroy
Apartments renovation on November 10, 2009. The CHA advertised the RFP in the Chicago
Sun-Times, Chicago Defender, Extra and on the CHA Website. The CHA also directly solicited
seventy-six (76) firms, including seventeen (17) MBE/WBE/DBE firms, and forty four (44)
assist agencies. A Pre-Proposal Conference was held at CHA Offices, 60 E. Van Buren, 13th
Floor Bid Bond Room on November 13, 2009. Addendum No. 1 was issued on November 18,
2009 to respond to vendor requests for information (RFIs). The CHA received nine (9) proposals
on November 25, 2009. A three (3) person committee consisting of members chosen from the
60 East Van Buren Street, 12th Floor Chicago, Illinois 60605 · (312) 913-7282· www.thecha.org

 Capital Construction and Office of Development Management Departments (the “Evaluation
Committee”) evaluated the proposals.
The Evaluation Committee reviewed and scored the proposals and the Department of
Procurement and Contracts (DPC) determined that five (5) firms were deemed to be in the
competitive range set by the Director of Procurement and Contracts. Oral presentations and
negotiations were held on December 9, and 11, 2009 and the Respondents within the competitive
range were further evaluated and scored.
The RFP procurement process allowed for the selection of a responsible and highly qualified
Respondent based on price related factors, work plan, past performance related to rehabilitating
low income housing tax credit multi-housing developments, experience with LEED certification,
quality control and assurance plans, schedule, and contract administration and relationship with
subcontractors and material suppliers. In addition to the qualitative complexities generated by
low income housing tax credits, and LEED NC v3.0 certification at the silver level, this project is
funded in part through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”). This
process also allowed the demonstration of the capacity, experience, and quality assurance which
will need to be applied to produce meticulous reporting and detailed record keeping to comply
with all applicable provisions of ARRA, including the Buy American provision. d’Escoto, Inc.’s
proposal offered the best value to the CHA, cost or price and other factors considered.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to 1) award a contract to d’Escoto,
Inc. in the firm fixed amount of $391,500 for Owner’s Representative Services at Pomeroy
Apartments (IL2-039), a Senior Housing building located at 1039 West Hollywood Avenue, and
2) assign the contract to a limited liability entity . This award is subject to the OR’s compliance
with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.
