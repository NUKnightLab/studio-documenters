**Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
FY2015 Clinical vs. Non-Clinical Vacancies Filled;
FY2015 Vacancies Filled through 1/26/15 by Hiring Source;
FY2015 Separations and Hires;
RN Separation Benchmarking;
Turnover Data of FY2014 Hires;
Current CCHHS Retirement Risk; and
FY2015 HR Goal: Improve / Reduce Average Time to Hire.
With regard to the information contained on slide 5 of the presentation regarding Request to Hires (RTHs) totals,
Ms. Lopez indicated that the total number of RTHs can fluctuate from month to month based on positions filled,
new RTH packets that are received, and RTH packets that are retracted by hiring managers for reasons such as
those relating to reorganization design. Director Collens clarified that the data presented on RTHs speaks to work
flow within the Human Resources Department; however, there is a broader institutional question about the total
number of vacancies. Ms. Lopez stated that the total number of vacancies is 996, as of February 6th. Board
Chairman Hammock requested that the number of vacancies be included in future presentations as a third line on
the slide. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that they will supplement the graph with the
current number of vacancies; he reminded the Committee that, while there is an organizational goal of getting
down to 600 vacancies by the end of the fiscal year, there will never be a circumstance where 100% of the
vacancies are currently being worked and processed.
During the discussion of the information contained on slide 10 of the presentation regarding Current CCHHS
Retirement Risk, Ms. Lopez stated that, for Tier 2 employees who were hired on or after January 1, 2011, after 10
years of service, they have to be at least 62 to retire; this represents an increase of 12 additional years in
comparison to Tier 1 employees. She and her staff plan to look into whether that change is impacting the
System’s ability to recruit, to see if that is the reason why people are leaving or not coming on board. The
administration cannot control the pension plan itself, but they can review the subject and determine if that is a
factor. If that is the case, the administration can further deliberate compensation strategies that can offset that as a
reason why people are leaving or not coming on board. She stated that it will probably take a few months to
research the benchmark data that staff can obtain; she estimated that the Committee should expect to receive an
update on the matter within 2-3 months.
During the discussion of the information on slide 11 regarding the goal of reducing the average time to hire, Ms.
Lopez provided additional information regarding hiring processes for general hire/randomized and actively
recruited positions. For general hire/randomized positions, Director Collens inquired whether hiring managers are
able to do a qualitative assessment of the lot of applicants who meet the minimum qualifications for a position,
before the applicants are randomized. Ms. Lopez responded in the negative. According to the provisions of the
Employment Plan, for those positions under the general hiring process, if 100 people apply for a position, the
applicants are randomized down to a minimum of 15 per vacant position; all 15 must be interviewed. For those
positions identified as actively recruited, the hiring manager receives the information on all qualified candidates
and can identify which ones they want to interview; they have to select at least three for interviews. Director
Collens stated that he was curious to see whether staff could estimate the cost of operating the system this way,
versus what one would call a “normal” human resources system; he added that there should be a way to identify
the costs associated with Shakman compliance.
Following the discussion, Dr. Shannon stated that the CCHHS Employment Plan Officer will be providing
Employment Plan training for the entire Board at the April Board Meeting; more details about the Plan will be
clearer to the Board at that time.
