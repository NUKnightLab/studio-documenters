BOARD ACTIONS
1.

Case No. L-UC-15-003
County of Cook, Sheriff of Cook County/American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, Council 31/Metropolitan Alliance of Police, Chapter 438

Chairman Gierut called the case and asked General Counsel Nelson to present the issues of the case to the Board. General
Counsel Nelson stated that this case comes before the Board on AFSCME’s appeal of the Executive Director’s
Revocation of Certification Order. In September 2014, AFSCME filed a unit clarification petition. No one objected to the
petition, and the Executive Director issued the certification clarifying the bargaining unit. After the certification issued,
MAP contacted the Executive Director and advised that MAP already represented the employees in question. The
Executive Director subsequently revoked the certification. AFSCME appealed the revocation and MAP intervened in the
appeal. After her presentation, General Counsel Nelson recommended that the Board affirm the Executive Director’s
Revocation Order. After discussion, Member Anderson moved to accept the Executive Director’s Revocation Order.
Member Lewis seconded the motion, and the Board passed it unanimously, by a voice vote.
2.

Case No. L-CA-15-046
Kenneth Sawyer/City of Chicago

Chairman Gierut called the case and asked General Counsel Nelson to present the issues of the case to the
Board. General Counsel Nelson stated that the Executive Director issued a dismissal on a charge alleging that the
Respondent violated Section 10(a) of the Act and that Charging Party filed an appeal that had no merit. After her
presentation, General Counsel Nelson recommended that the Board uphold the Executive Director’s dismissal. After
discussion, Member Lewis moved to affirm the Executive Director’s dismissal. Member Anderson seconded the motion,
and the Board passed it unanimously, by a voice vote.
