Ms. Hackett also reported that pension reform legislation affecting the Chicago Park District

 b. ADP
Michael Maratea reported about the status of the payroll administrator used by the Fund for
its own employees. Mr. Maratea stated that the Fund currently used Ceridian but has found
them to be ineffective and unresponsive to service problems. He stated that the Fund had
met with representatives of ADP, who had previously provided payroll services to the Fund,
and that ADP would be able to provide the services currently received from Ceridian for a
slightly lower cost. Because of their location in Chicago, Illinois, Mr. Maratea expected that
ADP would be more attentive to the Fund in addressing service problems and proposed that
the Fund retain ADP.
It was then moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Janura that the Fund retain
ADP as the vendor for processing the Fund’s payroll and administering the Fund’s FSA plans
as presented and that the Fund’s staff shall take all action reasonably necessary to effectuate
the foregoing including, subject to legal review and sign off, the execution and delivery of
related written agreements on the Fund’s behalf by the Executive Director.

She found that the members attending had overwhelming positive comments about the plan
changes. Vendors providing screening and other demonstrations for the attendees. Nickol
Hackett stated that there was a lot of engagement between the Fund staff and the members.
The lower attendance could be attributed to the fact that the costs for health benefits
remained largely constant and that members were not compelled to make changes.
5. Consideration of October 29, 2013 Investment Committee Recommendations
Nickol Hackett reported that at their meeting on October 29, 2013, the Investment Committee
considered three finalists in its search for a Global Fixed Income Manager and recommended
that the Board select Franklin-Templeton Institutional for an investment of approximately
$200,000, 000 for the County Fund. This investment represents a new sub-asset class for the
County Fund and provides for more diversification in the portfolio. The investment is about 9%
of total allocated fixed income assets and represents less than 2.5% of total County Fund assets.
In addition, Ms. Hackett stated that at the meeting on June 17, 2013, the Investment Committee
approved
that TIPS
be reclassified
into a multi-sector sub-asset
class.

6. Legal Report
a. Notice of Felony Convictions
Margaret M. Fahrenbach reported on recent felony convictions regarding County employees.
She stated that on October 28, 2013, Mr. Thomas Hawkins and Mr. John Racasi were found
guilty by a jury of accepting bribes while they were employed by the County Board of
Review. Because both Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Racasi had received refunds from the Fund,
they were no longer eligible to receive benefits and the Board did not need to take any action
in regard to their convictions. Ms. Fahrenbach also stated that on July 30, 2013, Mr. Robert
Mitchell pled guilty to charges relating to the sale of cigarettes without the required revenue
stamps and that he was sentenced on October 29, 2013. Although Mr. Mitchell has not
requested a refund of his contributions, there is no need for the Board to take any action
regarding his conviction because he does not have enough service and is too young to receive
annuity benefits from the Fund. Information regarding his guilty plea and sentencing will be
maintained in the Fund’s records. The trustees discussed the most cost effective way of
identifying those members who might have felony convictions relating to their employment.
Fund staff agreed to investigate that matter and report back to the Board.
b. Hayward Settlement Agreement
Ms. Fahrenbach then reported that a settlement agreement had been negotiated between the
parties in Hayward v. County Employees' and Officers' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook

County Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County

p. 7

 County, which was brought by Ms. Latoya Hayward in regard to how the Fund administered
benefits to returning military benefits under federal law. The settlement provides that Ms.
Hayward will be able to purchase service credit for her military service, including the ninety
days after her discharge without interest. In addition, the Fund will provide a notice to all
members regarding the benefits available for veterans.
It was then moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Janura that the Board
approve the Settlement Agreement proposed for Hayward v. County Employees' and
Officers' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County, 13 C 2887, and that the Fund Staff be
authorized to take all action reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE

7. Review and Approval of Military Service Policy
Paul Rzeszutko then presented to the Board the Military Service Policy that had been prepared by
the Fund’s staff. He reported that the benefits for members of the military who return to County
service are governed by both the Pension Code and federal law. This policy will better inform
members of their rights to benefits for their military service and will enable the Fund staff to better
administrate those benefits.
It was then moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Richardson that the Board
approve the Military Service Policy presented and that the Fund staff be authorized to implement the
policy instanter.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE

8. Old Business/New Business
There was no old business or new business discussed.
There being no further business before the Board, the meeting was adjourned.
