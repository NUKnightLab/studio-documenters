Item No. 1A

RECOMMENDATION TO ACCEPT AND SUBMIT TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (HUD) THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY’S SINGLE
AUDIT REPORT, FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUDIT AND COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL
REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018
Presenter:

Michael Moran, Chief Financial Officer
Allen Faucett, Jr., Director, Audit Management and Compliance

Recommendation
The Finance and Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the Chicago Housing Authority’s
(CHA) audited Single Audit Report, Financial Statement Audit and Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 pursuant to the Finance and Audit
Committee’s Charter. The 2018 reports were presented to the Finance and Audit Committee at
its July 16, 2019 Regular Meeting.
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners accept the attached Single Audit Report,
Financial Statement Audit and Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the year ended
December 31, 2018, and authorize the CEO or his designee to submit such documents to the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
The Chief Financial Officer and Finance Division have completed all necessary due diligence to
support the submission of this initiative and recommend the approval of this item accordingly.
Background
The Single Audit is required for entities such as the CHA that receive and use substantial federal
financial assistance, and reports on the CHA’s compliance with applicable federal regulations.
The CHA is required to submit the Single Audit Report to HUD by September 30, 2019, nine
months after the end of its fiscal year (December 31, 2018).
HUD requires public housing authorities to annually publish a complete set of financial
statements presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified
public accountants. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Authority engaged Ernst and
Young to audit its results and issue the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report in accordance

 with HUD requirements. The Authority is required to submit the Financial Statement Audit and
Financial Report to HUD by September 30, 2019, nine months after the end of its fiscal year
(December 31).
Respectfully Submitted:
