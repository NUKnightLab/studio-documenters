Building. The 4-story brick, steel, and reinforced concrete building has a large stone entry portal that is
vertically accentuated by courses of brick running to the roofline. The stone portal consists of two fluted
columns with an entablature, which is underneath a stone cornice and dentil molding. The façade has many
ornate elements, such as patterned brick, stone accents underneath the windows, and carved stone pieces
near the roof line. The windows on the first floor are all glass block, while the windows on the second and
third floor are metal sash unit. The parcel at 627 Milwaukee sits to the southeast of 6540 St. Antoine and is
an empty grassy lot. The parcels at 6527-6545 Oakland compose a paved parking lot to the rear of 6540 St.
Antoine. A, 6’-tall chain-link fence encloses the lots at 627 E. Milwaukee and 6527-6545 Oakland.
6540 St. Antoine

include the following work items:
Rear/East Elevation
• Install new wall-mounted light fixtures (color black)
• Clean masonry and tuckpoint where necessary
• Paint sign ADA ramp which reads “Campbell Boyer” (color not specified)
• Repair existing steel sash
• Install new neon sign at entrance
West Elevation
• Repair existing steel sash
• Remove glass block at second story and install new aluminum sash storefront windows
• Install new wall-mounted light fixtures (color black)
• Clean masonry and tuckpoint where necessary
• Retain and repair existing rolling metal shutter door at primary entrance
North Elevation
• Repair existing steel sash
• Install new wall-mounted light fixtures (color black)
• Clean masonry and tuckpoint where necessary
South Elevation
• Repair existing steel sash

 •

Clean masonry and tuckpoint where necessary

HVAC Mechanical Units
• At the rear of the building, install two new transformers to be screened with a perforated metal
mesh wall
Landscape and hardscape
• As per the submitted site plan, add new concrete/paving and landscaped islands to the existing
concrete and grassy parking lots to the rear of the building, at 627 E. Milwaukee and 6527-6545
Oakland
• At alley to rear of building, repair and resurface with asphalt and reclaimed brick
• At alley to rear of building, establish a green amenity space to include pea gravel and concrete
walkways, raised planters, and outdoor furniture (type/style not provided)
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• As per the Detroit Historic Designation Advisory Board, architect Charles FJ Barnes designed the
building, which initially housed office and warehouse space. From 1930 through the 1950s, the
building was occupied by Boyer-Campbell, a machinery and wholesale hardware dealer. City
directories indicated that the Jam Handy Organization occupied a portion of the building as early
as 1935.
• Jam Handy was designated a local historic district in 2014
ISSUES
• The Standards require that the “…surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.”
• The applicant has outlined the methods they shall employ to clean the building’s exterior
walls/brick. Staff is unclear if the proposed cleaning method is “the gentlest means possible.” Staff
will therefore undertake additional research and discussions with the applicant to confirm. The
findings will be presented to the Commission at the 9-11-2019 meeting.
RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for all of the proposed work
items, with the exception of the proposed cleaning, because they meet the Secretary of the Interior
Standards for Rehabilitation, standards # 6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature
shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence
and 10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would
be unimpaired. However, staff does recommend that the Commission issue this COA with the following
conditions:
•
•
•

Staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the final signage.
Any bolts associated with the proposed new signage shall be driven into the mortar only
Staff shall be afforded the authority to review and approve minor revisions to the approved design.
Should staff determine that any such revision does not meet the Standards, staff shall forward the
project to the Commission for review at a meeting.

 •
•
•

HDC staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the project’s final landscape
plan
HDC staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the final furniture selection for
the green amenity space
The new aluminum storefront windows at the first story shall be simulated divided lite units, ie, the
muntins shall be applied to the exterior surface of the glass

Regarding the proposed cleaning, as noted above, staff is currently researching the proposed methods for
cleaning, paint removal, and repainting of the exterior walls to ensure that they will not damage the
masonry. The results of this research will be presented to the Commission at the 9-11-2019 meeting. Staff
therefore demurs from proferring a recommendation re: this scope item at this time.

 Preserving traditionnalal
architecture is complex.
You know it, and at Quaker Windows & Doors, we know it too.
Yet at Quaker, it’s nothing new to us. It has been a specialty
of ours for years. In fact, we like to think we make this
seemingly uneasy task an easy one.
That’s why designers, developers and architects
from across the country have turned to Quaker
for our assistance with their historical projects.
When it comes to being faithful to original
window aesthetics, Quaker knows exactly what
needs to be done and how to make it all work.
In this booklet, you’ll see more than 140
examples of beautiful architecture from
our history and read the stories behind
them. In each case, Quaker has had the
supreme honor of being a part in
bringing these treasures back to life.

We encourage you to contact your
Quaker sales representative or call
for more information on how
Quaker can help you with your
next historical renovation project.
Thank you for reading and for
your interest in Quaker windows
and doors.

Professional Building Lofts (formerly The Professional Bldg.)

Kansas City, MO
Built: 1929
Windows: Historical Single Hung

The Professional Building is one of the Kansas City’s earliest examples of modernistic architecture.
This 16-story, art-deco structure was erected during a time when Kansas City was going through a
remarkable commercial growth period. Yet at the same time, “The City of Fountains” was falling
behind other major U.S. cities when it came to healthcare. Designed by local architects Charles
Smith and George McIntyre, The building was built to exclusively house healthcare professionals. It
is now a mixed-use building with retail tenants and tech firms on the ground floor and lofts above.

One of the first buildings erected for the Georgia School for the Deaf was Fannin Hall,
named for O.P. Fannin, a teacher at the school. Along with being a classroom and learning facility, it also served as a dormitory and Civil War Hospital during its early years.
Today, it is still called Fannin Hall but serves as Cave Spring’s City Hall. The building
is part of an entire district that was added to the National Register of Historic Places in
1980. The Greek-Revival building has been the recipient of several renovations over the
years, the latest in 2015 when it was completely rehabbed from top to bottom, including
new windows.

Found near downtown Baltimore, Poole & Hunt Foundry opened in 1843. New buildingss
were added as part of an expansion more than a decade later. Once in these new buildings, Poole & Hunt quickly became one of the largest machine manufacturing shops in
the U.S., best known for casting the 36-inch columns and brackets that still support the
Capitol’s dome in Washington DC, and for producing the cloth used for clipper ship sails
ls
during WWI. After a 1995 fire, the foundry was mostly vacant until a local developer
acquired it and turned it into a mixed-use project.

Colt Gateway (formerly Colt East Armory)
Hartford, CT
Built: ca. 1865
Windows: Historical Single Hung
Credit: State
The original Colt Armory, located in an area known to Hartford locals as “Coltsville”,
burned to the ground in 1864. The widow of Colt firearm inventor and industrialist Samuel Colt, ordered a new 5-story armory to be built in the exact same place. Once done,
it was larger, more fireproof and more decorative with an Italian-Renaissance look. In
addition, the new Colt Armory carried over the most dramatic feature of the original; the
he
blue onion dome with gold stars, topped by a gold orb which is the undisputed Colt sym-bol. Colt Manufacturing occupied the building until 1994 when it consolidated operations
ns
with their West Hartford locale. A different gun manufacturer, U.S. Fire Arms Mfg.,
moved in at that time and stayed until 2011. Today, the armory has been transformed intoo
something completely different; a live-work community called Colt Gateway which
contains residential and commercial lofts. Meanwhile a fiberglass dome, replicating the
original, proudly sets atop the armory.

This structure is found in one of Louisville’s oldest districts, Butchertown, an area that
was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Butchertown dates to the
1820s, when numerous butchers and stockyards relocated there after being banned from
downtown Louisville for sanitation reasons. The area thrived for more than a century,
that is until the great Ohio River flood of 1937. When flood waters receded, only a handdful of buildings had survived, including this large 1-story industrial warehouse that was
e,
once inhabited by leather goods and cotton manufacturers. It’s now home to The Pointe,
a Historically Certified Redevelopment Project, that is a popular event center and houses

After sitting empty for 10 years, the old St. Mary’s School in Detroit’s Greektown
neighborhood, was reinvented as the headquarters for JACK Entertainment, owners of
a casino in downtown Detroit. The 5-story structure, built shortly after the Civil War's
end, served not only as a school, but also as an orphanage. It was also a residence for Catholic sisters. In 1966 the school closed, and it became St. Mary’s Community Center. The

The former headquarters of the Quaker City Dye Works is made up of 2 masonry structures in Philadelphia's South Kensington neighborhood. The company manufactured dye,
yarns and silk, and employed 200 workers at its peak. Starting in the 1970s, the complex
housed Pieri Lamp Factory. However, in the years that followed, the lamp industry began
migrating overseas and business dwindled. By the time developers scouted the property
in 2011, Pieri had only one employee left. The structures have now been redeveloped as
apartments for teachers and offices for non-profit organizations related to education.

Leavenworth, KS
Built: ca. 1880
Windows: Historical Triple Hung
Credit: State & Federal
In the late 1800s, Leavenworth was the most important manufacturing city in Kansas.
Surprisingly, it was also one of the largest and busiest manufacturing cities in the entire
United States, thanks in part to the stove industry. Great Western Stove Company,
which made several types of coal, wood and gas heating and cooking stoves, operated out
of 6 large buildings in downtown Leavenworth. Great Western Stove ran until the 1940s
before closing. Later, the main building became home to a large tire distributor. Developers bought the complex in 2005 with the intent of turning it into residential and commercial leasing spaces. Despite several setbacks over an 8-year period, the owners stuck with
their game plan and the first phase of Stove Factory Lofts came to fruition in 2015. To
meet the required specifications, Quaker designed and manufactured a special triple hung
window. Full completion of the project came in 2016.

Liggett & Myers Tobacco built this 6-level building as a warehouse to dry chewing
tobacco. The city’s 19th-century tobacco industry was so strong that by 1897, Liggett &
Myers moved its headquarters from downtown to a larger complex on the edge of the
city. However, the company kept their “drying house” for several more years. Ensuing
owners used the building mostly for storage. The interior was made-over in the 1980s,
then it sat vacant for some time. Developers purchased the building in 2014 and convertedd
it into low-income apartments.

mill and began a long history of textile production. Additions were made in 1929 and
again in 1939 to accommodate a new business, Morganton Full Fashion Hosiery Mill.
Those firms merged in 1960 to form Premier Hosiery which was in business until 1995.
Soon thereafter, the City Redevelopment Commission of Morganton purchased the

For decades, thousands of freight trains and armies of cargo handlers bustled amid a
complex of multi-story warehouses in downtown St. Louis known as The Cupples District. With just a couple exceptions, the 20 Cupples buildings were 5 to 7 stories tall and
conveniently connected by an underground network of tunnels which linked them to the
riverfront. As rail traffic gave way to over-the-road and air delivery during the latter halff
of the 20th century, the signifance of the Cupples District withered. Several buildings
were eventually lost to fire or torn down to make way for Interstate 40. Today, only 8
remain standing, including:
Cupples Station #1 is also known as The Hammermill. With arched brick doorways and
13-foot-high arched windows, this beauty was built at the turn of the century. Although
designated as a City Landmark and found on the National Register, Cupples #1 was vacantt
for nearly 20 years until being renovated into lofts and commercial spaces.
Cupples Station #8 is a 6-story structure, originally known as Terminal Warehouse

Decades later, a project to turn the buildings into lofts/apartments began. During the

As the U.S. textile industry began to mushroom in the late 19th century, this was one

This wasn’t their first mill, but it definitely became one of their most successful. It had
the distinction of being the first modern flannel mill in the South, thus it was thought too
be a revelation in textile circles. Because of that, the original name proposed was “Revelation Mill” according to local historians. But that name was nixed because of Biblical
associations. So, the Cones chose “Revolution Mill” instead. With a name finally in
ve
place, Revolution Mill burgeoned. By the 1930s, the mill had become the largest exclusive
flannel producer in the world. It operated as Revolution Mill until 1982 before being soldd

Built: 1900-1971
Windows: Historical Single Hung
Credit: State
After an 1896 tornado damaged or wrecked St. Louis’ City Hospital, a new hospital was
gs
developed on the same property. With various expansions, it would consist of 13 buildings
by 1971. With the exception of three, all the buildings in the complex were either directlyy
attached to one another or linked by above-ground corridors and bridges. With the
rexception of one, the buildings share the same brick color and a remarkably consistent ornamentation. The complex, a member of the National Register, sat fully abandoned after
the hospital moved to a new locale in 1985. More than 15 years later, selective demolitionn
began in anticipation of the complex’s long-hoped-for renovation. Work halted for a longg
period afterwards but resumed in 2005 when a rehab plan was introduced by developers.
The property is now known as The Georgian (after the Georgian Revival style architecs.
ture it sports), and has been redeveloped into residential, commercial and retail properties.

Built: 1901
Windows: Historical Single Hung
Credit: State & Federal
The 8-story Rudman Building was designed by nationally-renowned St. Louis architect
Isaac S. Taylor. It was built to be corporate headquarters for Peter’s Shoe Company. Lat-er, International Shoe Company called the building home. It was added to the National
Register in 1984. After 20 years of being unoccupied, developers purchased the building
and shortly thereafter a complete renovation began. Now known as Rudman on the Park,
it houses lofts as well as commercial and retail businesses.

Constructed for the A. N. Kellogg Auxiliary Newspaper Co., this building housed their
entire printing operations during its first 5 years. That's when Western Newspaper Union,
owned by Midwest media mogul George Joslyn of Omaha, purchased the business and the
building. This acquisition, plus subsequent mergers, made Western Newspaper Union the
largest auxiliary newspaper company in the country. It wasn’t until the 1950s that Western
Newspaper Union began to see a drop off. Decades later, the building would actually be
completely empty when it was bought and refurbished by a company that oversees nationwide rollouts of digital menu boards and other cutting-edge restaurant technology.

A.F Bornot Dye Works Lofts

(formerly A.F. Bornot French Steam Dyeing & Scouring)
Philadelphia, PA
Built: 1901-1925
Windows: Historical Awning & Picture Window
Credit: State & Federal
This multi-structure property takes up an entire block in central Philadelphia. The main
building has 4 stories and is a well-known area icon with its curved corner. It was built as
the corporate headquarters for A.F. Bornot French Steam Dyeing & Scouring. The man
for whom the building is named, A.F. Bornot, was a French immigrant who ran a very
successful dry cleaning and dyeing business for many years. Adjacent 2-story buildings
housed Security Elevator Company and an auto brake manufacturer respectively. Eventually occupancy ebbed and by 1997, all 3 were empty. They would stay that way for 15
years until new owners took over with a redevelopment plan in hand. After 4 years of construction and behind-the-scenes work, developers turned the 3 abandoned structures, plus
a fourth building, into a mixed-use project, featuring lofts, single-family homes and retail
tenants. Tall, arched windows, which are replicas to the originals, allow tenants beautiful
views of the city. The property is listed on the Philadelphia Historic Register and is also
part of an entire district that sits on the National Register.

Drayton Lofts (formerly Drayton Mill)

Capewell Lofts

Spartanburg, SC
Built: 1902-1960
Windows: Historical Single Hung (also Quaker Terrace Door) Credit: State & Federal
Drayton Mill was a big part of the thriving textile industry that served South Carolina
during a major part of the 1900s. At its peak, 1,200 people were employed there. Over the
years, it was expanded and altered, a common practice among textile mills as they adapted
to changes and innovations in manufacturing technology. Additional buildings were added
all the way up to 1960. The demise of Drayton Mill, and others just like it, began in the
1980s. Drayton Mill would officially shut down in 1995 and lay mostly vacant until 2007
when a local investor acquired it. In time, it was converted into luxury lofts. Meanwhile,
Drayton Mill’s historical clout was recognized with a National Register spot in 2012.

Hartford, CT
Built: 1903
Windows: Historical Single Hung & Picture Window
Credit: State & Federal
This building was the 2nd home for the Capewell Horse Nail Company, as the original
burned down in 1902. For years, Capewell horse nails were heavily sought around the
globe. English Kings, Russian Czars and Japanese veterinarians were among Capewell’s
large customer base. Nail production came to an end in 1981 and the building, topped
by a stately Romanesque Revival tower, sat unoccupied for 30 years. In 2014, developers
purchased the Capewell building and turned it into LEED-Gold certified loft apartments.

The 7-story George Washington Hotel was built in preparation for the 1904 World’s Fair
in St. Louis. President Theodore Roosevelt was a visitor to the fair and stayed at the hotel. In 1979 the building was renovated and converted into low-income housing. Almost 30
years later, in 2007, a similar yet more detailed restoration plan was implemented. Today,
it contains low-income and senior apartments.

 The Lofts at NoDa Mills (formerly Mecklenburg Mill)l)

Charlotte, NC
Built: 1903-1905
Windows: Historical Single Hung & Arched Trapezoid
Credit: Unknown
A restoration project that was in the works for many years was finally completed in 2015
when Mecklenburg Mill became The Lofts at NoDa Mills. NoDa is the name of the
area where the development is located (short for North Davidson - a nearby road). This
mill was built during the nation’s textile boom. Unfortunately, the original owners were
never profitable and sold it in 1926. It would be sold 3 more times before shutting down
s.
in 1969. By and large, the structure remained remarkably unchanged during those 43 years.
Afterwards, Mecklenburg Mill sat vacant for many years as it passed through the hands of
several more owners. The final investor, a non-profit organization, took over in 2011 and
made good on a promise to turn it into affordable housing.

Columbia Knitting was the first tenant. Uses for this 4-story structure have included

Renovations have turned it into apartments and retail spaces.

The Chesterman (formerly Brownhill & Kramer Hosiery Mill)

Philadelphia, PA
Built: 1905
Windows: Historical Picture Window with Floating Awning
Credit: Unknown
Almost immediately after this building was erected, the Brownhill & Kramer Hosiery
Mill moved in. The original building eventually grew to as many as 6 interconnected
structures by 1926. In 1938, Brownhill & Kramer found itself lured outside of Philadelphia by the prospect of cheaper labor and closed the mill’s doors. Following Brownhill
& Kramer’s departure, the complex was renamed The Chesterman Building, as it was
occupied by the Chesterman-Leeland Company, manufacturers of stainless steel and
k.
aluminum products. Despite other inhabitants over the years, the Chesterman name stuck.
The Chesterman, which sits in a unique area of Philadelphia called Fishtown, has recentlyy
been reinvented as a loft apartment building, with spectacular views of the city and the
Delaware riverfront courtesy of its huge windows.

Bee Hat Lofts (formerly Bee Hat Company)

St. Louis, MO
Built: 1905
Windows: Historical Single Hung
Credit: State
Early in the 20th century, many multi-story warehouses and factories popped up in down-town St. Louis, including this 7-story building. It was distinguishable from the others
because of detailed terra cotta ladies gracing the roofline and ornate terra cotta lion headss
on the building’s exterior just above the 1st floor. Gauss Langenberg Hat Company is
believed to have operated there for some time before Bee Hat Company came in 1944. It’s
’s
where Bee Hat stayed until moving to a new St. Louis locale in 2000. This city landmark
has since been developed into a mixed-use property. As for the unique lion heads, they’ve
been kept intact and designed to allow steam to “roar” out of their mouths at various
intervals, creating an impressive sight for pedestrians.

(formerly Sears-Roebuck Nat’l Headquarters)
Chicago, IL
Built: 1905-1907
Windows: Historical Single Hung & Picture Window
Credit: Unknown
When the Chicago headquarters for Sears Roebuck & Co. was built, it contained 4 build-ings, a park and its own power plant. Amazingly, a year after its opening, the campus was
bustling with more than 9,200 employees. In the 1920s they would add their own athletic
field and facilities. Eventually, the campus covered 41 acres. When Sears moved to the
infamous Sears Tower in 1973, most of this facility was vacated. Eventually, some of the
buildings on the campus were completely demolished. Others remained, including this
structure which contained Sears-Roebuck’s catalog printing facility and product test lab.
After years of non-occupancy, a non-profit group tackled the job of refurbishing the cam-pus, turning it into a mixed-income neighborhood with affordable housing apartments.

Cleaning Brickwork
Abstract: This Technical Note addresses cleaning of brickwork and brick pavements. Methods for removal of efflorescence
and a variety of specific stains are discussed, which should result in the successful cleaning of brickwork.

Key Words: abrasive blasting, acid, bucket and brush cleaning, cleaning, efflorescence, poultice, pressurized water, stains.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:
During Construction
• Store brick off the ground under protective covering
• Protect wall surfaces and unlaid brick from rain-splashed
mud and mortar splatter
• Use bricklaying techniques that reduce mortar smears
during construction; brush excess mortar after tooling
and remove large mortar tags using wooden paddles or
nonmetallic tools
• Protect any unfinished walls with waterproof cover at
the end of the workday, and extend covering at least 2 ft
(0.6 m) down from the top of the wall on all sides

Prior to Cleaning
• Match the cleaning method and cleaning solution to the
type of brick
• Verify that the cleaning method and cleaning solution
used are approved by the brick manufacturer
• Protect adjacent materials that may be damaged by the
brick cleaning process
• Perform trial cleaning on a 20 sq ft (2 m²) sample area
and allow wall to dry before evaluating results
• For some projects, multiple cleaning trials may be
required in order to achieve acceptable results
• Control and/or treat runoff in accordance with the
requirements of the jurisdiction

For All Cleaning Methods
• Follow the brick manufacturer’s recommended cleaning
procedure
• When manufacturer recommendations are not provided,
refer to Table 1 for recommended cleaning methods for
various brick categories
• Select the gentlest effective cleaning method
• Do not allow cleaning solution to dry on brickwork
• Do not use unbuffered muriatic (hydrochloric) or
hydrofluoric acid
• Clean new masonry as soon as possible after mortar
hardens, typically between 24 hours and seven days,
depending on the cleaning method used
• Apply cleaning solution as recommended by the cleaning
product manufacturer

Bucket and Brush Cleaning
• For pre-wetting, saturate the area to be cleaned and
brickwork below with water prior to applying cleaning
solution, and keep the entire area wet during the cleaning
process

© 2018 Brick Industry Association, Reston, Virginia 

• Mix and apply cleaning solution according to cleaning
product manufacturer’s instructions
• Thoroughly rinse the area being cleaned and the area
below with water

Pressurized Water Cleaning
• Use a stainless steel 25 to 50 deg. fan tip, held a
minimum of 12 in. (305 mm) from the brick surface
• Do not use water pressures higher than 400 psi
(2800 kPa) as measured at the nozzle tip unless
permitted by brick manufacturer
• For pre-wetting, use very low pressure (less than 100 psi
[700 kPa])
• Saturate the area to be cleaned and brickwork below
prior to applying cleaning solution, and keep wet until final
rinse
• Apply cleaning solution according to manufacturer’s
instructions by brush or a chemical pump/tank sprayer
with a wide-angle fan-shaped sprayer nozzle tip,
maximum 30 to 50 psi (200 to 350 kPa)
• For rinsing, use low pressure (100 to 400 psi [700 to
2800 kPa])

Other Cleaning Methods
• Poultice: Do not use as a general cleaning method; use
only on persistent, localized stains
• Abrasive blasting: Except as noted in this document, do
not use
• Microabrasives: Consult manufacturers of proprietary
systems for suitability; these are gentler alternatives to
abrasive blasting
• Lasers: Match laser type and light wavelength to stains to
be removed; specialized contractors are required
• Refer to “Removing Specific Stains” for cleaning solution
recommendations to clean various known stains

Efflorescence Control
• Allow one year of weathering to naturally remove newbuilding bloom
• Remove light efflorescence by dry-brushing or brushing
with a stiff fiber brush and water
• Before attempting to clean recurring efflorescence,
identify and correct the source of water penetration and
allow the brickwork to dry
• Remove stubborn accumulations with a proprietary
cleaning product according to the manufacturer’s
instructions

 INTRODUCTION
The final appearance of brickwork depends primarily on the attention given to masonry surfaces during
construction and the cleaning process. Even with good practices during construction, some cleaning may be
required at the end of brickwork installation. Recommended cleaning methods and materials vary based on the
type of brick, mortar, construction and reason for cleaning. For example, cleaning newly constructed brickwork of
an entire building requires a different approach from removing stains from an isolated portion of an existing wall.
The selection of effective cleaning solutions, as well as the use of consistent and appropriate cleaning procedures
throughout the job, is essential to successful cleaning and cannot be overemphasized. Improper cleaning practices
can cause a host of problems that in severe cases cannot be repaired.
This Technical Note does not address specific safety issues related to various methods of cleaning brick masonry.
Beware that cleaning agents and processes may be hazardous and may cause injury if used carelessly or
inappropriately. Cleaning operations should be performed only by personnel trained to handle the safety risks
associated with the work and following the label instructions.

GENERAL
Prior to beginning masonry cleaning, there are a number of considerations common to all projects that should be
addressed during the planning process.

Project Considerations
Clean Water. Water used for cleaning should be potable (suitable for drinking). Iron content should be less than
2 parts per million by weight. Determine whether the local water includes additives, water softeners or other agents
that may cause issues if used for cleaning.
Cold Weather. Air temperature, temperature of masonry and wind conditions affect the drying time and reaction
rate of cleaning solutions. Chemical cleaning solutions are generally more effective when the outdoor temperature
is 50 °F (10 °C) or above. To avoid harming the masonry or increasing the risk of efflorescence, do not clean
during freezing weather or when freezing weather is expected. It is preferred to use cleaning methods that involve
water only when the ambient temperature will be 40 °F or above and will remain so until the wall is dry. Ideally,
temperatures should be above freezing for seven days after cleaning is completed.
Hot Weather. Do not allow cleaning solutions to dry on brickwork. Be aware that an increased risk of rapid drying
exists in high temperatures. In hot weather, the cleaning crew can reduce this risk by working on small or shaded
areas and being diligent about keeping the wall saturated during cleaning solution application and rinsing.
Work Area. The size of the work area should be determined after trial cleaning or as part of the first area cleaned.
The size of the work area can be modified as appropriate while the work progresses.
Work Sequencing. Cleaning should be performed systematically, proceeding consistently per the “General
Cleaning Procedure” section of this document within a given work area or scaffolding tier and from one end of the
elevation to the other. Perform cleaning to achieve uniform coverage of surfaces, including corners, moldings and
interstices, and to produce consistent results without streaking or damaging the wall surface. Avoid overlapping
work areas.
Safety. Some chemicals used to clean brickwork may be harmful, including their fumes. Protecting people and
property is an essential component of any cleaning project. Use protective clothing and accessories, ensure
proper ventilation, and exercise safe handling procedures in accordance with OSHA requirements. Comply
with federal, state or local laws regulating the use and disposal of chemicals and cleaning runoff or wastewater.
Some jurisdictions may require containment and treatment of the runoff water before it can leave the site. Dilution
of runoff and its release into the stormwater management system should not be expected or allowed unless
expressly permitted by the applicable jurisdiction. Strictly observe the cleaner manufacturer’s safety data sheets and
recommended handling requirements. The contractor should consider preparing a formal cleaning plan describing
the cleaning process, materials and procedures to ensure that these handling and protection issues are addressed.
Brick Texture. Brick texture may also influence the effectiveness of cleaning operations. Mortar stains and smears
are generally easier to remove from brick with smooth textures because less surface area is exposed. Smoother
brick textures include die skin extruded brick, glazed brick, water-struck molded brick and dry-pressed brick. Brick
www.gobrick.com   Brick Industry Association   TN 20   Cleaning Brickwork   Page 2 of 13

 with smoother surfaces are easier to clean because residue, acid staining, and mortar smears are more visible
on their unbroken surfaces. Mortar and dirt tend to penetrate deeper into textured surfaces. Brick that are wire-cut
or coated, or textured extruded brick and sand-struck molded brick, provide additional surface area for water and
acid absorption. Use of pressurized water may assist in achieving complete rinsing of rough-textured brick.
Characteristics Requiring Extra Care. Both new and existing brickwork may incorporate characteristics that
must be considered in the development of a cleaning plan to avoid damage during the cleaning process. These
can include but are not limited to decorative coatings or finishes, water repellents, mortar type, mortar color or
historic significance.

Trial Cleaning
Before cleaning, it is beneficial to test potential cleaning procedures and solutions on a sample area of about
20 sq ft (2 m²), or large enough to evaluate the selected cleaning procedure. Although not common for small
residential projects, trial cleaning on larger, more complex projects not only serves as a means to determine
whether mortar or stains can be removed but also helps to identify the most effective procedures that cause the
least damage to the masonry. Optimal concentrations of cleaning products and solutions to unexpected problems
can also be determined through trial cleaning. Once approved, the test area can serve as a standard for the
appearance of the brickwork after cleaning.
Reactions between cleaning solutions and certain minerals found in some brick or their surface coatings may
cause stains or worsen existing stains. It is always best to test a small area before subjecting the entire project to
the cleaning procedure. Ideally, a portion of the sample panel can be tested, leaving the building and the rest of
the sample panel undamaged in case the brickwork is adversely affected. Trial cleaning should be performed on
an inconspicuous location on the building and conducted at temperature and humidity conditions that will closely
approximate the conditions that will be experienced during cleaning of the remainder of the building.
Judge the effectiveness of a cleaning agent or procedure by inspecting both brick and mortar in the trial area
after it has dried sufficiently, usually in about one week. Approval of the cleaned brickwork in cleaning area should
precede application of the cleaning agent to the remainder of the building.

CLEANING NEW BRICKWORK
With new construction, keeping the masonry clean as it is erected can be very cost-effective, as it can eliminate
the need for extensive cleaning after construction. Brickwork should be cleaned soon after construction is
completed to remove mortar smears and construction dirt that detract from the appearance of the masonry. When
it is determined that brickwork needs to be cleaned, the manufacturer’s identification card on the brick cube
and other pertinent manufacturer information should be consulted first to ascertain the recommended cleaning
products and procedures for the brick. As discussed in the “Select Cleaning Method by Brick Category” section,
recommended cleaning materials and methods vary with the type of brick.

Keeping Brickwork Clean During Construction
When constructing new brick masonry, it is important to use construction practices that will minimize the amount of
cleaning required. The following are some general practices that can be used to construct a cleaner wall:
• 
• 

• 

• 

• 

Protect site-stored brick from mud. Store brick off the ground and under a waterproof covering.
Erect scaffolding far enough away from the wall to allow mortar droppings to fall to the ground.
Scaffold boards closest to the wall should be angled away from the wall or removed at the end of the
day to remove excess mortar droppings and to prevent rain from splashing mortar and dirt directly
onto the completed masonry.
Protect the base of the wall from rain-splashed mud and mortar splatter. Use straw, sand, sawdust,
plastic sheeting or fabric spread out on the ground, extending 3 to 4 ft (0.9 to 1.2 m) from the wall
surface and 2 to 3 ft (0.6 to 0.9 m) up the wall. Keep this protection in place until final landscaping.
Cover wall openings and tops of walls with a waterproof membrane at the end of the workday and
during other work stoppages to prevent mortar joint washout and entry of water into the completed
masonry. Extend covering a minimum of 2 ft (0.6 m) down each side of the wall.
Protect newly constructed brickwork from adjacent construction practices that may cause staining,
such as placing concrete or spraying curing agent.
www.gobrick.com   Brick Industry Association   TN 20   Cleaning Brickwork   Page 3 of 13

 It is always advisable to keep brickwork as free from mortar smears as possible. Masons should also be careful to
prevent excessive mortar droppings from contacting the face of the wall or falling into the air space. In addition to
the bricklaying techniques described in Technical Note 7B, the following practices should be followed:
• 

• 

• 

After spreading mortar, but before laying brick, the trowel edge should be used to cut mortar even
with the wall face, preventing excessive extrusion of mortar onto the face of the wall as the brick are
laid.
After tooling joints, excess mortar and dust should be brushed from the wall surface, preferably using
a medium-soft bristle or fiber brush. Brushes with steel bristles are not recommended, as they may
leave behind small particles that can rust. Brushing is preferable to bagging or sacking—the practice
of rubbing a damp burlap material across the face of the masonry. Avoid any motion that will result in
rubbing or pressing mortar into the brick faces.
Large clumps of mortar that adhere to brickwork should be allowed to dry and become firm before
removing by hand with wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools.

Select Cleaning Method by Brick Category
Generally, the cleaning method that effectively cleans the brickwork while being the gentlest, or least harmful to
the masonry, is the most appropriate. Try cleaning masonry by hand with a bucket and brush or pressurized water
before using chemical cleaners.
Always consult brick manufacturers for recommendations on cleaning specific brick. This information is usually on
the identification card located on the brick cube, in the product data literature or on the manufacturer’s website.
In some cases, the manufacturer’s recommendations will permit the contractor to proceed to a specific cleaning
product and method. When more than one type or color of brick is used, the brick manufacturer can aid in
identifying a cleaning method that will be safe for all the brickwork. Table 1 recommends appropriate cleaning
methods for various brick types when guidelines are not available from the brick manufacturer. These are general
recommendations and may not be effective on all brick described in each category. As noted in Table 1, the use of
colored mortars may require special consideration.
Multiple methods may be required on the same wall to achieve an adequate level of cleaning. Once the method(s)
of cleaning are selected, refer to the section “General Cleaning Procedure.”

 Bucket and Brush Hand Cleaning. This is a popular but misunderstood method used to clean brick masonry.
Its popularity is due to the simplicity of execution and the availability of proprietary cleaning compounds. This
cleaning method is the least aggressive of the methods listed here and is applicable to virtually all brick types. Hot
water (temperature of 120 °F [49 °C]) can be used to improve effectiveness of cleaning with water. If a chemical
cleaning solution is used, then it should be compatible with the brick.
Pressurized Water Cleaning. The brick manufacturer should be consulted before use of pressurized water to
clean brick. Cleaning contractors often use pressurized water because it is less labor intensive than bucket and
brush cleaning and permits large areas to be cleaned much more quickly. Pressurized water cleaning permits
the operator to spray clean water on a wall over 100 ft (30 m) from the tank and compressor. However, the
method requires more skill than the bucket and brush method, because effective results depend on maintaining
a consistent, appropriate pressure, water flow rate, distance from the wall, and angle between the nozzle and
the wall. It is also important to use uniform horizontal strokes. The effects of pressurized water cleaning on each
project or type of brick should be carefully considered, because excessive pressure may damage brick surfaces,
erode mortar joints, and remove finishes or other surface coatings, resulting in a different appearance. The
following definitions apply for pressurized water cleaning:
• 
• 
• 

• 

Very low pressure: Less than 100 psi (700 kPa); 4 to 6 gal per minute (15 to 23 L per minute).
Low pressure: 100 to 400 psi (700 to 2800 kPa); 4 to 6 gal per minute (15 to 23 L per minute).
Medium pressure: 400 to 800 psi (2800 to 5600 kPa); 4 to 6 gal per minute (15 to 23 L per minute).
Medium pressure water cleaning may be appropriate in some cases, with certain types of brick. Use
only if permitted by the brick manufacturer.
High pressure: Greater than 800 psi (5600 kPa). High-pressure water cleaning is not appropriate for
brick and may damage the brickwork.

Pressures should be measured at the tip of the nozzle to determine conformance. Use a 25 to 50 deg. fan-shaped
stainless steel nozzle tip, and maintain a distance of 12 in. (305 mm) minimum between the nozzle tip and the
brick surface.
Hot water can also be used in pressurized water cleaning. However, note that some pressure-washing equipment
may not be capable of providing or using hot water.

General Cleaning Procedure
The following general cleaning procedure is applicable to a variety of cleaning methods and is commonly used for
new brickwork, as well as for existing masonry.
1.  Timing. Identify the appropriate time frame to begin cleaning. Mortar must be hardened prior to
cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed.
In some cases, it may be possible to clean earlier; however, effects on the masonry and influencing
factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered.
If cleaning with water only (no chemicals added), cleaning may begin 24 to 36 hours after completion
of brickwork. Avoid waiting too long between the completion of the masonry and cleaning. After one
month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove.
2.  Remove Mortar Clumps. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic
tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust
stains. Remove smaller particles using a fiber bristle brush.
3.  Select Cleaning Solution. Select the proper cleaning solution for the condition/application. There are
many types of proprietary cleaners available that are formulated to remove specific stains or are for
use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar
and adjacent materials. Strictly follow the cleaner manufacturer’s recommended instructions, including
recommendations for cleaning procedure direction (top-down or bottom-up) during all stages of the
project, such as saturating the wall, applying the cleaning solution and rinsing. Verify compatibility
of the cleaning solution with the application equipment to be used. The cleaning solution should be
approved by the architect/engineer and/or brick manufacturer. Each product being considered should
be evaluated as discussed in “Trial Cleaning.” It is recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of

www.gobrick.com   Brick Industry Association   TN 20   Cleaning Brickwork   Page 5 of 13

 cleaning solutions for overall cleaning, starting from the gentlest solution and method, in the following
order:
a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 

Water only
Mild detergents/surfactants
One-step chemical cleaners
Two-step chemical cleaners

Treatment of specific stains does not necessarily need to follow this order of cleaning solution application,
but the overall premise of starting with gentler cleaning methods still applies. If overall cleaning will be
performed on the project, then complete it prior to treatment of the specific stains. The overall cleaning
may reduce the intensity or area of the specific stain, allowing the stronger chemicals to be used on a
smaller area.
Do not use unbuffered muriatic (hydrochloric) or hydrofluoric acid. Use of unbuffered high-strength
acid solutions such as these tends to cause further stains and damage mortar joints. Many proprietary
cleaners contain acids; however, their formulations include other chemicals that make them safer, easier
to use properly and more environmentally responsible. Be aware that some cleaning solutions use
compounds that will convert to these acids when combined with water. Review product safety data sheets
to determine whether these compounds are present.
4.  Protect Surroundings. Protect adjacent materials and nearby plants. Mask or otherwise protect
windows; doors; and materials such as sealants, metal, glass, wood, limestone, cast stone, concrete
masonry and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions. Cleaning chemicals may also damage
plants and grass. It may be necessary to prevent the cleaning solution and runoff from contacting
plants or the surrounding soil. Use protective clothing, equipment and accessories, in addition to
proper ventilation and safe handling procedures in accordance with OSHA requirements to protect
applicators.
5.  Saturate with Water. Thoroughly saturate the area to be cleaned with water to keep it from
absorbing the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles to a depth where they will be difficult
to remove. When using pressurized water, a very low pressure (no more than 100 psi [700 kPa]) is
recommended. Surfaces below the area being cleaned should also be saturated and kept wet until
after the final rinse to prevent streaking and absorption of the runoff from above. If the wall surface
appears to be drying, then reapply water until ready to apply the cleaning solution. Cleaning solutions
containing dissolved mortar particles can be drawn into dry masonry and cause staining.
6.  Apply Cleaning Solution. Mix and apply the cleaning solution in strict accordance with the cleaner
manufacturer’s instructions. Clean 20 sq ft (2 m²) of wall area at a time. The solution may be applied
using a masonry cleaning brush or chemical pump/tank sprayer. Brushes should be long handled
with stiff bristle fibers. Do not use metal brushes, which may damage mortar joints or result in
further staining. If spraying, use a wide-angle fan-shaped sprayer nozzle tip and a pressure of 30
to 50 psi (200 to 350 kPa). No more than 50 psi (350 kPa) of pressure should be used, because
higher pressure can force the cleaning solution deep into the masonry to become a source of future
staining. For proprietary compounds, follow the cleaner manufacturer’s instructions for application,
dwell time and cleaning technique. Depend on the chemical reaction of the cleaner rather than the
scrubbing action of the brush or pressure of the sprayer. If stubborn mortar smears are not removed,
reapplication is often more effective than harder scrubbing or applying more pressure.
7.  Rinse Thoroughly with Water. Flush walls with large amounts of clean water, in strict accordance
with the cleaner manufacturer’s instructions, before cleaned surfaces can dry (approximately 5 to
10 minutes after application). For pressurized water cleaning, low pressure (less than 400 psi [2800
kPa]) is recommended to flush the cleaning solution from the brickwork. If trial cleaning or prior
experience with the selected brick has established that no damage will result, then higher pressures
may be used. No matter what method is used, a thorough and uniform rinse is critical. Failure to
completely flush the wall of cleaning solution and dissolved matter may result in the formation of
“white scum.” During rinsing, monitor the appearance of the runoff. Clear runoff at the base of the
wall indicates adequate rinsing. In addition, the pH of the wall surface and the water runoff should

www.gobrick.com   Brick Industry Association   TN 20   Cleaning Brickwork   Page 6 of 13

 be checked periodically with pH paper to confirm that both are returned to neutral (pH 6.5 to 7.5).
Additional rinsing is needed if the pH is outside these values in either direction (too acidic or too
basic). Measure the pH of the wall surface again 48 hours after cleaning has been completed, when
the wall is dry. If the pH is not neutral, then rinse the surface until neutral pH is achieved.

Improper Cleaning
Cleaning failures generally result from one of the following actions:
• 

• 

• 

• 

Failure to thoroughly saturate the brick masonry surface with water before and after
application of chemical or detergent cleaning solutions. Dry masonry permits absorption of
the cleaning solution and may result in white scum, efflorescence, manganese or vanadium stains.
Saturating the surface prior to cleaning reduces the masonry’s absorption rate, permitting the cleaning
solution to stay on the surface of the brickwork rather than being absorbed. Likewise, thorough rinsing
reduces the potential for stains caused by cleaning solution residue.
Use of improper chemical cleaning solutions. Improperly mixed or overly concentrated acid
solutions can etch the brick or dissolve cementitious materials from mortar joints. Unbuffered acid
tends to discolor masonry units, particularly lighter shades, producing an appearance frequently
termed “acid burn,” and can also promote the development of vanadium and manganese stains.
Excessively aggressive cleaning methods. Cleaning methods such as abrasive blasting and highpressure water cleaning, which remove stains from the masonry by abrasion, can etch mortar joints
and remove the outer surface of brick, resulting in permanent damage.
Failure to protect windows, doors and trim. Many cleaning agents, particularly acid solutions,
have a corrosive effect on metal. If permitted to come in contact with metal frames, the solutions may
cause pitting of the metal or staining of the masonry surface and trim materials such as limestone,
concrete masonry and cast stone.

CLEANING EXISTING MASONRY
During periodic inspections of existing masonry structures, areas of discoloration or stains should be identified and
addressed as a part of routine maintenance. When maintenance cleaning is deferred, pollution and atmospheric
conditions can cause stains, dirt and soil to accumulate on masonry surfaces. Accumulated stains will likely
require stronger cleaning products and methods to remove them, which can result in increased risk of damage to
the masonry.
It is always advisable to collect as much information as possible before attempting to clean existing masonry.
In some cases, water repellents may have been applied to the masonry, or there may be other unexpected
treatments or conditions that interfere with cleaning. In these instances, professional guidance should be sought in
determining how to address these conditions to achieve successful cleaning.
Large-scale cleaning of existing masonry typically occurs as part of a maintenance or repair project. If repairs will
be performed, sequencing is important. Consider the intensity of the soiling and other work to be performed to
accurately assess needed repairs and to avoid introducing excess water into the wall assembly. Refer to Technical
Note 46 for more information on repairs and maintenance.
Bucket and brush hand cleaning and pressurized water cleaning, discussed in “Select Cleaning Method by Brick
Category,” are also used to remove general stains from existing masonry. Besides these, other techniques used to
remove dirt or specific stains from existing masonry [Ref. 3] are described briefly in this section.

Using a Poultice
A poultice is a paste made with a solvent or reagent and an inert material. It works by dissolving a stain and
absorbing or pulling it into the poultice. Poultices are normally effective for deep, localized stains affecting small
areas of brickwork. They are not intended for overall cleaning. Poultices tend to prevent stains from spreading
during treatment and to pull stains out of the pores of brick.
Poultices for cleaning masonry can be purchased commercially or made on-site. The inert material used in the
poultice may be talc, whiting, fuller’s earth, diatomaceous earth, bentonite or other clay. Any chemical cleaner
can be turned into a poultice. The solution or solvent used depends upon the nature of the stain to be removed.
Enough of the solution or solvent is added to a small quantity of the inert material to make a smooth paste. The
www.gobrick.com   Brick Industry Association   TN 20   Cleaning Brickwork   Page 7 of 13

 paste is smeared onto the stained area with a trowel or spatula to make a coating at least ⅛ in. (3 mm) thick.
The paste is covered with plastic for 24 hours, the plastic is removed, and then the paste is allowed to dry.
When dried, the remaining powder, which now contains the staining material, is scraped, brushed or washed off.
Repeated applications may be necessary.
If the solvent used in preparing a poultice is an acid, then do not use whiting as the inert material. Whiting is a
carbonate that reacts with acids to give off carbon dioxide. While this is not dangerous, the whiting will become
extremely foamy and destroy the power of the acid.
There are also proprietary poultice-like cleaning materials that cure to the consistency of a film and can be pulled
from the surface in sheets instead of removing dried paste. These are marketed for cleaning interior surfaces
because they do not require the use of water but are also appropriate for exterior applications. The formulation of
these materials allows for use over much larger areas than typical poultices.

Abrasive Blasting
Nearly all abrasive blasting procedures, by their nature, will result in silica exposure, potentially from both the blast
media and the material removed from the brickwork. The dust created can be harmful if inhaled, which poses
health and safety concerns. Respirators should be used in combination with other personal protective equipment
during any cleaning involving abrasive blasting methods.
Abrasive methods are not generally recommended for cleaning brickwork. Attempting to remove dirt or stains by
abrasion is risky because the outer surface of the masonry may also be removed, resulting in permanent damage
and increased water penetration. Abrasive cleaning may erode mortar joints and may also roughen the surface of
the masonry, which increases its tendency to hold dirt, becoming dirtier faster and making future cleaning more
difficult. Sanded, coated, glazed and slurry-finished brick should not be cleaned by abrasive blasting. This topic
is discussed in more detail in “Dangers of Abrasive Cleaning to Historic Buildings” [Ref. 4], which can also be
applicable to some newer brick.
In some cases, it may be possible to safely clean brick masonry by abrasive blasting; however, this typically
requires a gentle abrasive and a highly qualified operator, in conjunction with proper specifications and job
inspection. In a few instances, abrasive blasting is the only method that will remove persistent stains. This method
is sometimes preferred over conventional wet cleaning, since it eliminates the problem of chemical reactions with
vanadium salts and other materials used in manufacturing brick. Abrasive blasting involves an air compressor,
blasting tank, blasting hose and nozzle, as well as protective clothing, a hood and a respirator for the operator.
The air compressor should be capable of producing 60 to 100 psi (400 to 700 kPa) at a minimum air flow capacity
of 125 ft³ (3.5 m³) per minute. The inside orifice or bore of the nozzle may vary from 3⁄16 to 5⁄16 in. (4.8 to 7.9 mm)
in diameter. The sandblast machine (tank) should be equipped with controls to regulate the flow of abrasive
materials to the nozzle at a minimum rate of 300 lb per hour (136 kg per hour).
Methods for cleaning masonry using abrasives may be executed at high or low pressures and with dry abrasives
or abrasives added to a stream of water. Abrasives should be selected based on the degree of cutting or cleaning
desired and the amount of change in the surface of the masonry permissible. Silica sands, crushed quartz,
crushed granite and white urn sand (round particles) are among the harder abrasives at approximately 6 on the
Mohs scale. Softer abrasives include crushed nut shells, dry ice and baking soda. If used, these materials should
have a gradation appropriate for the intended use [Ref. 2].
Dry abrasive blasting (sandblasting) at high pressure is perhaps the best known of these methods but has a
significant potential to damage masonry. Wet sand cleaning depends on water-cushioned abrasive action for its
effectiveness. It is similar to sandblasting, with the addition of water into the air stream, which eliminates dust. It
is often suggested when abrasion of the surface is permissible. Such instances may include removal of paint or
other surface coatings.
Wet aggregates delivered at low pressure through a special nozzle are sometimes used on soft brick and soft
stone materials, and are particularly effective on surfaces with flutings, carvings and other ornamentation. Wet
aggregate cleaning is a gentle but thorough process, employing a mixture of water and a friable aggregate free
from silica, with a scouring action that cleans effectively with less surface damage than sandblasting or wet sand
cleaning.

www.gobrick.com   Brick Industry Association   TN 20   Cleaning Brickwork   Page 8 of 13

 The steps listed in “General Cleaning Procedure” can also be followed for abrasive blasting with the following
modifications:
• 

• 

In step 3, instead of selecting a cleaning solution, select abrasives that are clean, dust-free and
sufficiently hard. Test-clean several areas at varying distances from the wall and at several angles
that afford the best cleaning job without damaging brick and mortar joints. Workers should be
instructed to direct abrasive at the brick and not directly at the mortar joints.
Omit steps 5 through 7.

Other Methods
Microabrasives. Microabrasive cleaning methods may be better suited to use on masonry than traditional
abrasive methods, as they are gentler and less likely to damage substrates. These methods differ from the
traditional methods due to the media used and the lower pressures involved. They often include collection and
encapsulation of the media after application, resulting in less cleanup. These systems are currently proprietary but
have been in use in the United States and Europe since the 1980s.
Lasers. In recent years, laser technology has progressed such that handheld units are available and feasible
for use on building exteriors. Stain removal occurs by vaporization and/or by breaking the chemical bond of the
stain to the substrate. Specialized contractors are required for laser use, and not all laser types are effective on
all stains due to incompatibility of the stain color with the laser wavelength. It is expected that laser technology for
cleaning brickwork will continue to improve.

REMOVING EFFLORESCENCE
The removal of efflorescing salts is relatively easy compared with some other stains. Efflorescing salts are water
soluble and generally will disappear of their own accord with normal weathering. This is particularly true of “newbuilding bloom,” which tends to occur during construction or shortly after construction is completed due to normal
water loss during post-construction drying.
Before efflorescence is removed, any sources of moisture ingress should be repaired and the brickwork allowed
to dry. White efflorescence can often be removed by dry-brushing or brushing with a stiff fiber brush and water.
Heavy accumulations or stubborn deposits of white efflorescence may be removed with a proprietary cleaner. It
is imperative that the manufacturer’s instructions be carefully followed. Refer to Technical Note 23A for a more
detailed discussion on removing and preventing efflorescence.

REMOVING SPECIFIC STAINS
Whether a stain results from chemical reactions within a brick or external materials being spilled, splattered on
or absorbed by brickwork, each is an individual case and must be treated accordingly. When using any cleaner,
it is advisable to consult the brick manufacturer for cleaning advice, to follow the instructions of the cleaner
manufacturer, and to trial clean in an inconspicuous area before using a cleaning method on an entire project.
There are a variety of proprietary cleaners that effectively remove most of the common substances that stain
brickwork, including bronze and copper stains, efflorescence, graffiti, iron stains (rust), lime run, manganese
stain, moss, oil and tar stains, paint, smoke and vanadium stain. When available, these are preferred over sitemixed or “homemade” cleaning solutions because they are generally safer, easier to control and more consistent,
resulting in successful cleaning. In some cases, these cleaners have been developed in conjunction with brick
manufacturers.
In addition to proprietary cleaners, many stains can be removed by scrubbing with kitchen cleansers, bleach or
other household chemicals. A combination, such as is found in some kitchen cleansers, may prove most effective.
The sections below list some nonproprietary alternatives for removal of common stains. Further information on
causes and prevention of stains is contained in the Technical Note 23 Series.

Brick Dust
Dust produced from the cutting of brick sometimes adheres to the surface of brickwork. A soft fiber brush is
recommended to remove dust particles from the brick surface. Wire brushes should not be used to remove dust
because they can damage the brick surface. When removing dust, it is important to wear a dust mask or respirator
www.gobrick.com   Brick Industry Association   TN 20   Cleaning Brickwork   Page 9 of 13

 to ensure that dust particles are not inhaled. Afterward, the surface should be wiped down using a dust mop
or a damp cloth. Use of compressed air to clean dust is not recommended due to the increased risk of particle
inhalation.

Dirt and Mud
Dirt and mud stains can be difficult to remove, particularly from textured brick. In addition to proprietary cleaners,
scouring powder and a stiff bristle brush are effective if the texture is not too rough. For very rough textures,
pressurized water cleaning can be effective.

Egg Splatter
Brickwork vandalized with raw eggs has been successfully cleaned by pre-wetting the stain, applying a saturated
solution of oxalic acid crystals dissolved in water, and rinsing with water. Mix the solution in a nonmetallic
container and apply with a brush.
If the egg splatter is to be removed from brick that contain vanadium (typically light-colored units), then a solution
of 15 oz washing soda (sodium carbonate) per 1 gal of water (113.5 g per 1 L) should be applied to the brickwork
following the oxalic acid solution. Without this neutralizing solution, cleaning with oxalic acid may cause more
severe staining.

Manganese (Brown) Stain
Besides specially formulated proprietary compounds, an alternate treatment sometimes suggested for new and
mild manganese stains is oxalic acid crystals and water. Mix 1 lb of crystals per 1 gal of water (119 g per 1 L).
The neutralizing wash mentioned in the “Egg Splatter” section should be considered when oxalic acid is applied to
brown or light-colored brick. Another recommended effective treatment for manganese stains is a solution of equal
parts white vinegar, hydrogen peroxide (3 percent solution) and distilled water.

Oil and Tar Stains
Oil and tar stains may be effectively removed with commercially available oil and tar removers. For heavy tar
stains, mix the agents with kerosene to remove the tar, and then rinse with water to remove the kerosene. After
application, the stains can be hosed off. When used in a steam-cleaning apparatus, cleaners have been known to
remove tar without the use of kerosene.
Where the area to be cleaned is small, or where minimal cleanup is desired, a poultice using naphtha or
trichloroethylene is most effective in removing oil stains.
Dry ice or compressed carbon dioxide may be applied to make tar brittle. Then light tapping with a small hammer
and prying with a putty knife generally will be adequate to remove thick tar splatters.

Organic Growth
Occasionally, an exterior masonry surface remains in a constantly damp condition, thus encouraging moss, algae,
lichen, or other microbial or organic growth. Manufacturers of masonry cleaning products offer biocides targeted to
remove organic and microbial growth on masonry surfaces. Applications of household bleach, ammonium sulfate
or weed killer, in accordance with furnished directions, can also successfully remove organic material in some
cases.

Paint, Coatings and Graffiti
Commercial and proprietary paint removers and organic solvents are most effective at softening or dissolving
paint so that it can be removed with a scraper and a stiff bristle brush or rinsed away with water. Specialized
cleaning systems designed for encapsulation and peeling of applied coatings are also effective. For very old
dried paint, organic solvents may not be effective, in which case the paint may be removed by abrasive blasting
or scrubbing with a nonmetallic abrasive pad. Try removing paint and coatings using nonabrasive methods
first before proceeding to abrasive methods. Note that methods involving scraping and abrasive blasting are
not recommended when there is a risk that lead paint is present unless abatement protection procedures are

www.gobrick.com   Brick Industry Association   TN 20   Cleaning Brickwork   Page 10 of 13

 included, as the lead paint particles can be dispersed into the air. Graffiti that has penetrated into masonry is best
removed by a poultice, paste or gel that can cling to the masonry, extending its working time on the stain.

Smoke
Scrubbing with scouring powder (particularly one containing bleach) and a stiff bristle brush is often effective.

Vanadium (Green) Stain
Applying a solution of either potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, consisting of 0.5 lb hydroxide per 1 qt of
water (240 g per 1 L) to brickwork is an alternative treatment for vanadium stains. The solution should be allowed
to remain on the brickwork for two or three days and then washed off. Use a hose to remove any white residue
remaining on the brickwork after this treatment.
Sodium hypochlorite, the active ingredient in household bleaches, can also be used to remove mild vanadium
stains. Spray or brush onto the stain, and then rinse off after the stain disappears.
Oxalic acid is another chemical known to remove vanadium stains. A mixture of 3 to 6 oz oxalic acid per 1 gal of
water, preferably warm, (22.4 to 44.8 g per 1 L) should be applied to the brickwork, followed by the neutralizing
wash described in the “Egg Splatter” section. More severe staining may result if the oxalic acid solution is applied
without the neutralizing wash.

Welding Splatter
When metal is welded too close to brick stored on-site or completed brickwork, molten metal may splash onto
the brick and melt into the surface. A mixture of 1 lb oxalic crystals and 0.5 lb of ammonium bifluoride per 1 gal of
water (119 g and 61 g per 1 L) is particularly effective in removing welding splatters. This mixture should be used
with caution, as it generates dangerous hydrofluoric acid, which can also etch brick and glass.
Scrape as much of the metal as possible from the brick. Apply the mixture in a poultice and remove when it is
dried. If the stain has not disappeared, use sandpaper to remove as much as possible and then apply a fresh
poultice. For stubborn stains, several applications may be necessary.

Stains of Unknown Origin
Stains of unknown origin can be a real challenge. Applying a cleaning agent without identifying the initial stain may
result in additional stains that are more difficult to remove. The visual characteristics of a stain may be the first
clues as to its source. Identification of stains is discussed further in Technical Note 23.
To determine the composition of an unknown stain, samples of the stain should be extracted from the wall and
sent to a testing laboratory. Then the appropriate method may be implemented to clean the brickwork.

CLEANING HISTORIC STRUCTURES
Improper cleaning can cause irreparable damage to historic brickwork. Therefore, cleaning of structures with
historic significance should be overseen by a restoration specialist. Such a specialist will be able to identify
previous treatments, determine appropriate cleaners and cleaning methods, and provide quality assurance for the
project.
Before a historic structure is cleaned, consider the purpose of cleaning: to improve the appearance, to slow
deterioration, or to provide a clean surface for evaluation or further treatments. With historic structures, it is
imperative to use the least harmful cleaning method that will achieve the desired results. Cleaning methods and
materials must be carefully matched to the substrate to be cleaned, the type of soiling/staining to be removed
and the desired results. It is recommended to use cleaning trials to evaluate the effectiveness of various cleaning
products and methods. It is also recommended to determine the level of cleanliness appropriate for the historic
brickwork and structure. These issues are discussed in detail in the National Park Service Preservation Brief
“Assessing Cleaning and Water-Repellent Treatments for Historic Masonry Buildings” [Ref. 5].

 CLEANING BRICK PAVING
Some of the methods already described for cleaning brick walls, such as pressurized water cleaning or using a
bucket and brush, can be used successfully to remove stains that also affect pavements such as efflorescence,
hardened mortar, plant life, oil and tar, etc. However, acid-based cleaning solutions may not be appropriate for
pavements containing joint sand stabilizers or polymeric sand–filled joints. Prior to selecting a cleaning solution for
brick pavements, it is recommended to verify the compatibility of the cleaner with the paver manufacturer. Most
paver manufacturers will provide literature on recommended cleaning procedures.
Most paving systems can be kept clean in most environments by regular sweeping. In situations that lead to a
greater degree of grease buildup, stains from deicing salts, materials tracked or spilled onto the pavement, tire
marks or other stains, frequent sweeping or pressurized water cleaning at low pressure will help reduce the need
for more aggressive cleaning methods and solutions. Low-pressure water cleaning can be more effective when
hot water is used and when mild detergents are applied to the pavement surface.
Fresh mortar stains can be removed from existing or mortarless pavements before they set by covering the
pavement with clean, slightly damp, washed sand and sweeping toward the edges. When the surface is almost
clean, sweeping with dry sand should remove the remaining residue.
More stubborn stains, including food and paint, can be cleaned by scraping off the hard residue and then
scrubbing with a stiff bristle brush and scouring powder. Chewing gum can usually be removed from brick
pavements with nonmetallic tools, carefully applied medium-pressure water or freezing each piece of gum with
compressed carbon dioxide or dry ice, and then scraping or chiseling it off the pavement. Food stains and tire
marks are typically removed by scrubbing with a detergent or a proprietary cleaner. In damp or shady areas where
moss and lichens have grown in the joints, these can be killed using bleach and water mixed in a ratio of one to
one or proprietary biocide treatments.
Stains from polymeric sand can occur on paver surface adjacent to joints. To prevent this during construction,
it is critical to remove all sand or dust from the surface before and after activation. Leaf blowers on the lowest
setting held at a low angle can help redirect remaining sand and water into the joints. Using a shop vacuum can
also be effective in removing sand or dust from the paver surface. If the sand is not removed after activation and
haze stains appear on the paver surface, it is recommended to use a nonmetallic bristle brush with hot water
(approximately 180 °F or 82 °C) or vinegar to remove the haze. Proprietary cleaning products formulated for haze
removal are also available. Be aware that typical cleaning products formulated for masonry may react adversely
with the polymer in the sand and should not be used to clean the haze. In addition, many cleaning products
marketed by polymer sand manufacturers consist of unbuffered hydrochloric (muriatic) acid and should not be
used on clay pavers.
Cleaning solutions, polymeric sands or other products applied directly to clay pavers should always be tested on
a small, inconspicuous area before application to the entire project. Some of these products have been known to
haze, stain or discolor certain pavers. Stabilized sand-filled joints are generally resistant to pressure washing if the
nozzles are kept clear of the surface and the water jet is not aimed directly along the joints. Aggressive pressure
washing can cause localized removal of joint sand.

SUMMARY
Testing of cleaning procedures and chemicals as suggested in this Technical Note is strongly recommended.
Such testing should be performed under conditions of temperature and humidity that closely approximate the
conditions under which the brick masonry will be cleaned. Cleaning solutions and methods recommended by the
brick or cleaning agent manufacturer should also be trial tested over a small area before being committed to an
entire project. To minimize the risk of damaging the brickwork, begin by selecting the gentlest cleaning methods
and materials appropriate for the situation. The effects of any cleaning process on the brickwork, people and the
environment should be carefully evaluated before any cleaning begins.
The recommendations in this Technical Note should be used as a guide for successful cleaning of brick masonry.
Due to the diverse nature of cleaning solutions, procedures and problems, the Brick Industry Association cannot
accept responsibility for the final success or effectiveness of these procedures.
