III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 1, Ms. Besenhofer stated that this request will allow for additional time to
evaluate automation, as well as to potentially look at strategic sourcing through a Request for Proposals (RFP)
process of combining the System’s drug wholesaler responsibilities and needs along with its medical/surgical
needs. These are things that the administration is going to be looking at in terms of how it will be doing
sourcing moving forward, but a little bit more time is needed. With regard to what the strategy should be,
automation is continually changing within the pharmaceutical market, as well as on the medical/surgical
supply side; the vendors continue to come up with new technologies and new ways of doing things, to allow
the System to be able to better manage its drugs and supplies, and the costs associated with them. The
administration needs to make sure that they are looking at the latest and greatest, but also, that which will
integrate appropriately with all of the systems that the System has currently invested in. Ms. Besenhofer noted
that the contract increase is in a not-to-exceed amount; the intent is to look at this now, and if the
administration finds that there is a solution that is able to be implemented sooner, that will be done and the
changes will be made accordingly.
With regard to request number 2, Board Chairman Carvalho stated that Susan Greene & Associates (SGA) has
been integral to getting to the System to its current position with regard to CountyCare. He stated that he was
pleased to see that Ms. Greene and her staff will continue to be helping the System; he asked for further
information regarding how their role will change. It was noted that there are a total seven (7) persons from
SGA whose services are provided as part of this contract amendment.
Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, stated that SGA was brought into the System to execute and
implement CountyCare. He stated that the System is doing very well with CountyCare; as of last week, more
than 76,000 applications have been collected. It has always been the intention that the System would bring in
these jobs internally; the new System Director of Managed Care will be joining the System shortly. He stated
that he has asked SGA to do three things during this extension. Ms. Greene will need to transfer the
knowledge to the new incoming people, so she can transition out; hopefully in a month or so she will transition
out of the CountyCare part of it. Meanwhile she will assist with two things. First, patient access continues to
be an issue – the administration needs to make sure the people who are enrolled in CountyCare are able to get
in for care in a timely fashion, so Ms. Greene is working with Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of Clinical
Integration, and Debra Carey, Chief Operating Officer of Outpatient Services, to improve access. The
administration is also in the process of finding a status for CountyCare, because that Demonstration Project is
set to end on December 31st; Ms. Greene has a deep knowledge of how the system works, so he has asked her
to concentrate on that. Additionally, the administration may need to think about some of the managed care
functions that the System does not have internally today.
Director Butler, seconded by Board Chairman Carvalho, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 3. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

III. Action Items (continued)
C. Approval of Transfer of Funds requests (Attachment #2)
Aaron Galeener, System Director of Budget, presented the item for the Committee’s consideration.
Committee reviewed and discussed the matter.

The

Mr. Galeener provided an overview of the funds transfer process. He stated that, by County Ordinance, fund
transfers over the amount of $10,000 require approval by the System Board. He noted that the actual processing
of the transfer takes place at the County by their staff, and added that it must be a budget neutral transaction. If the
transaction is under $10,000, it requires internal System approval; following that, the County Budget Director has
to agree to process the transfer.
Director Butler, seconded by Board Chairman Carvalho, moved the approval of the
request to transfer funds. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

D. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Item
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare (Attachment #3)
Susan Greene, System Interim Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid
Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare. She stated that as of Friday, 78,000 applications have been
initiated; of that total, 4,400 have been initiated from Cermak Health Services of Cook County.
Approximately 550 applications are submitted to the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) per day;
to date, the System has submitted over 50,000 applications to DHS. Of that number, 30% of those applications
were submitted by Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs); the remainder of the applications were
submitted by System application assisters. The approval rate is at approximately 86-89%. She noted that there
are approximately 25,000 applications that are backlogged at the State. They are processing approximately
375 applications per day. They are now fully staffed, with 103 processers on campus; she expects that the
number of applications processed per day will increase now that they are fully staffed.

V.

A. Report of emergency purchases

VI. Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #5)
A. Financial Reports – through June 2013 (Attachment #6)
Mr. Galeener provided an update on the FY2014 budget timeline and plans. He stated that they have begun to
evaluate needs and have been meeting with each of the areas internally over the past few weeks. Discussions
have begun to be held with representatives from the President’s Office and the County’s Budget Office. While
those discussions are still on-going, they are hoping to finalize the System’s budget and reach agreement by
early to mid-August; while they are still evaluating, they are expecting to be able to have a budget prepared to
present to the System Board in August.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that what the System Board adopts goes to the County Board for approval;
following that, the President needs that to include in her budget, and she needs to submit her budget by a
certain date in order for the County Board to consider her overall budget. All of this is necessary to meet the
President’s goal of adopting the budget before the fiscal year starts December 1st.
Board Chairman Carvalho indicated that, in the context of the last several years, often through no fault of the
System, this Board has been asked to see a budget for the first time in one week and adopt it the next week; he
asked for additional information on the plans for when the administration anticipates that the budget will be
presented to the System Board for review and subsequent adoption. Mr. Galeener responded that there is still a
bit of uncertainty around the timeline of this. By Ordinance, the System is required to provide a budget 45
days before the President introduces her budget to the County Board. Until they set a date certain, the System
does not have a date certain. Mr. Galeener stated that the administration is hoping to provide the Board with
much more of an opportunity to review it before being asked to approve it.
John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, presented his report, and reviewed the information contained
in it. The Committee discussed the information, including the following subjects: electronic resource planning
(ERP) system; Bad Debt; and Days of Revenue Outstanding.
For future presentations, Board Chairman Carvalho requested that staff include more history and elaborate a bit
more on subjects on which they are reporting; this will assist in providing a more comprehensive set of
information for the new Directors.
During the discussion of the information regarding Days of Revenue Outstanding, Board Chairman Carvalho
inquired whether the System can track this separately by payer. Mr. Cookinham responded affirmatively.
Mr. Oder noted that it would be helpful, from the public’s perspective, if some of the accounting policies that
help explain the financial reports were provided as part of the reports – he indicated that there were portions of
the reports that appeared to be based on an accrual basis and parts that appeared to be based on a cash basis.
Following further discussion on the financial reports, it was determined that the Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR) for the year ended November 30, 2012 will be forwarded to the Committee Members
for their information1.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended June 30, 2013. This discussion focuses on
the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month. It
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
5
Page 38 of 70

 eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the seven months with overall
revenue of $436,522 and overall expenses was $560,486.
Net Patient revenue for the seven months was $244,407.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
EHR incentive program revenue was $6,577.
Other revenue was $3,461. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
June-2013 reduced by 25 to 97 days. Additionally, there was an 5 day increase in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including 1115 waiver
and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Page 39 of 70

 Total billed accounts grew by $5.905M (2.0%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure increased by $15.009M (5.3%).
The growth in this figure indicates a decreasing number of accounts are completing the
collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of June-2013 increased by
$2.661M (30.2%), as compared the November 30, 2012 balance and decreased by
$0.480M (-4.0%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that more
inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of June-2013 increased by $5.673M (3.6%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure grew by $5.594M (3.6%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates fewer accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that a lower number of accounts are being
removed from active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
7
Page 40 of 70

 The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $5.285M (-30.5%) by the end
of June-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2012.
This balance, as of the end of this month, was $3.123M (-20.6%) smaller than the
previous month’s balance. This indicates that more outpatient accounts are moving to a
“Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of June-2013 grew by $0.232M
(0.2%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is $9.415M
(7.3%) greater than last month’s figure.
The growth in this figure indicates that fewer Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Benefits - $80.854M
Supplies - $57.995M.
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $96.538M
Insurance - $6.873M.
8
Page 41 of 70

 Depreciation - $19.805M
Utilities - $4.840M

Nonoperating Revenue was $181.964M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
cigarette tax in the amount of $61.311M and property tax in the amount of $46.670M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.
