Ms. Hall noted that both online certi?cation efforts and veterans certi?cation programs are going well,
and have been a priority for the of?ce of Contract Compliance.

Ms. Hall explained some of the break out categories on the reports.

In response to Commissioner Reyes? concern regarding veterans, Ms. Hall responded that a veterans?
breakout will be added in 2012.

Ms. Hall clari?ed that these reports address neither the Forest Preserve District nor the Cook County
Health and HOSpitals System.

Commissioner Beavers noted the lack of African American participation as indicated in the Professional
Services Contracts Report.

Ms. Hall stated that quarterly reports will allow the Committee to review how it is doing in reaching its
goals.

In response to Commissioner Garcia?s inquiry as to how to get ?rms more involved, Ms. Hall
stated that she is looking to host a ?technology mixer? in May to bring local ?rms and large companies
together.

Commissioner Sims stated that it is imperative that there be transparency in Cook County government,
and that the aforementioned ?technology mixer? might make it look as if Cook County had a hand in
choosing certain ?rms or companies.

Commissioner Sims inquired whether a representative of the State?s Attorney?s Of?ce could inform them
how the City of Chicago deals with waivers and contract compliance.

Patrick Driscoll, Deputy State?s Attorney and Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, indicated he did not have
knowledge of how the City of Chicago handles these matters. He did indicate, however, that if more than
four Commissioners meet together over this issue, they need to notice the meeting.

Chairman Steele turned to the issue of creating a Waiver Committee, which would address how to assess,
grant and deny waivers. He stated that this Committee would also work to inform as many ?rms as
possible as to opportunities. Chairman Steele stated that he would meet with President
Preckwinkle regarding the creation of 3 Waiver Committee, and indicated that he would like Vice
Chairman Silvestri to be present at this meeting.

No action was taken on the above item, as this Committee meeting was for informational purposes
only.
