The OAG has reviewed 
mileage reimbursement procedures
and determined the policy includes
language dictating the procedure
for the inclusion of verifying
forms are completed accurately
including point~to-point mileage as
required by the county?s policy.
However, based on our review of
the mileage forms provided by
DPS management, we noted
several exceptions where no point-
to-point mileage was provided and
home-to-work mileage was not
being preperly deducted per the
CBA.

Management has partially
addressed the recommendation. If
DPS ensures on a go forward basis
that all mileage reimbursement
forms are completed accurately
according to the established
procedures, the action would
address the recommendation.
However, a follow-up review may
be necessary in the near ?xture.

reimbursement requesters}.

 

 

 

 

In-Pro cess

 

The GAG reviewed Wayne
County?s Mileage Reimbursement
Fomn 2 for frequent users and
determined the MRF does not
adequately address the
recommendation. Based on the
mileage forms reviewed, the GAO
could not determine the point-to?
point mileage on the Frequent
Users Mileage Form. The OAG
notes that the MRF does not
speci?cally require employees to
enter a From Location and a To
Location for each trip under Box
20 - Description of County
Business or Support. In addition,
there are no instructions for Box
20.

The DAG compared the mileage
reimbursement form for frequent
users to that of infrequent users,
and noted the only difference
between the two (2) forms is Box
20. The for infrequent users
requires the employee to record
the starting location in the ?rst box
and the ending location in the
second box.

Management has partially
addressed the recommendation. If
M853 revises the MRF for
frequent users to mirror the MRF

responsible for determining
whether the mileage

as stated in Section 3.2 of the

Wayne County Commission
Audit Committee, and the County Executive
Charter County of Wayne. Michigan

Re: Required Audit Planning Communications:

We are in the process of planning for the audit of the financial statements of the Charter County
of Wayne, Michigan (?Wayne County") for the year ended September 30, 2018. An important
aspect of planning for the audit is communication with those who have responsibility for
overseeing the strategic direction of Wayne County and obligations related to the accountability
of Wayne County. At Wayne County these responsibitities and obligations are held by the Wayne
County Commission, the Audit Committee, and the County Executive, collectively and individually;
therefore, it is important for us to communicate with each of you in your role.

As part of this communication process, we have spoken at length with Mr. Warren Evans (County
Executive), Mr. Raymond Basham (Chair of Audit CommitteeICounty Commissioner) and Mr.
Gary Woronchak (Chair of the Wayne County Commission), regarding our responsibilities under
generally accepted auditing standards and the planned scope and timing of our audit. The
purpose of this letter is to provide each of you with a summary ofthose discussions and to provide
you with the opportunity to communicate with us on matters that may impact our audit.

Our Responsibility Under Generalty Accepted Auditing Standards and Generaily Accepted
Government Auditing Standards

As stated in our engagement letter addressed to Ms. Marcella Cora, Legislative Auditor General,
and dated September 18, 2018, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to
express an opinion about whether the financial statements prepared by management with your
oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with US. generally accepted
accounting principles. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve you or management
of your responsibilities.

In accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAO Standards), we
are required to communicate all noncompliance with provisions of laws, regutations, contracts or
grants that have a material effect on the financial statements that comes to our attention. GAO
standards also require that we report any instances of abuse identified during that audit that could
be quantitatively or qualitatively material to the financial statements.

We expect to include an emphasis-oi?matter paragraph in the auditor?s report informing the users
of the financial statements about the significance of adopting a new accounting standard: GASB
Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployrneni Benefits Other than
Pensions. The proposed wording of the emphasispi-matter paragraph follows:

As described in Note to the financial statements, during the year ended September 30,
2018, the County adopted the new accounting guidance of Governmentai Accounting
Standards Board Statement No, 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for



 

DAP No. 2019-57900
Page 2 of 4

Charter County of Wayne, Michigan December 12, 2018

Postempfoyment Benefits Other than Pensions, which establishes accounting and
financial reporting standards for postemployment benefits other than pensions provided
to the employees of state and local governments. Our opinion is not modified with respect
to this matter.

Overview of the Pianned Scope and Timing of the Audit

Our audit fieldwork will include three phases. The planning and preliminary informationgathering
phase will occur during July and August; the risk assessment phase in September and October;
and the rest of our audit procedures will be performed through March 2019.

This is an audit of group financial statements. We have identified the Wayne County Employees'
Retirement System Defined Benefit Plan, Wayne County Circuit Court Commissioners Bailifis?
Retirement System and the Wayne County Employees? Retirement System Defined Contribution
Plan as components of the group financial statements of the County. The component auditor of
these components is George Johnson 8: Company. in order to issue the County?s financial
statements timely, we will need the full cooperation of George Johnson Company. We will be
communicating with George Johnson Company throughout the audit process.

We have identified HeaithChoice of Michigan as a component of the group financiai statements
of the County. The component auditor 0f the component is Alan C, Young Associates. In order
to issue the County?s financial statements timely, we will need the fuli cooperation of Alan C.
Young Associates. We will be communicating with Alan C. Young Associates throughout the
audit process.

We have also identified the Wayne County Detroit CDE, inc. as a component of the group
financial statements ofthe County. This component is audited by Plants Moran, although
the audit engagement team for this component is not the same team as the Wayne County group
audit engagement team. Thus. we will be communicating with the audit team throughout the audit
process.

To plan an efiectiye audit. we must identify significant risks of misstatement in the financial
statements and design procedures to address those risks.

We identified the following significant risks of misstatement:

Significant transactions (in terms of size andior volume during the year), including but not
limited to items such as property taxes. stateilocal grants and contracts, charges for
services, Read fund activity, vendor contracts, and payroll~related items.

a Compliance with Federal Programs under OMB Uniform Guidance

9 Proper recording of capital assets

9 Potential impairment and reeyaiuation of recorded capital assets/projects

Proper recording of the net pension liability, net OPEB liability. and the related deferral
balances

9 Internal controls surrounding online banking

a Management override of financial data from the normal accounting process

For the components identified above, we wiil communicate to the component auditors significant
risks of materlai misstatements offhe Group financial statements identified by us, and which we
believe are relevant to the work performed by the component auditor for purposes of the audit of
the Group financial statements.

in response to these identified significant risks, we will perform the following:

it Targeted testing of certain transactions to verify that transactions are supported by
appropriate documentation and are accounted for appropriately Testing includes
performing third party confirmations or other support and detaiied testing of 
items. This testing will aiso include certain unpredictable procedures for which we will
provide no advance notice.

. Review of grant agreements and testing of specific major programs and compliance as
part of the Federal AWarcls audit

. Detail testing of capital asset existence and recalculation of recorded baiances
a Review tests of impairments and analysis performed by Wayne County

a Review documentation prepared by the County?s actuary and County?s calculation of the
net pension and OPEB liabilities and related journal entries in accordance with GASB 68
and GASB 75

a Review controls surrounding online banking for primary cash accounts
9 Detail testing of manualjournal entries posted

For the components listed above, we will review the overall findings and conciusions oi the
component auditor that could have a material impact on the Group financial statements.

We wiil gain an understanding of accounting processes and key internal controls through a review
of the accounting procedures questionnaires and control procedures questionnaires prepared by
management. We wiil confirm through observation and inspection procedures that accounting
procedures and controls included in the questionnaires have been impiemented. We will not
express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controi over financiai reporting; however we
will communicate to you significant deficiencies and material weaknesses identified in connection
with our audit.

The concept of materiality is inherent in our work, We place greater emphasis on those items that
have, on a relative basis, more importance to the financial statements and greater possibilities of
material error than with those items of lesser importance or those in which the possibility of
material error is remote.

2018 Significant Accomplishments

Mai oritv of Reeor?nmendaticns implemented

Arguably, the single most important measure ofeffeetiveness of any internal audit organization
is the level or rate of implementation of the recommendations contained in issued reports. We
are extremely proud to report in 2018 that three (3) completed corrective action plan
engagements examined and. assessed implementation status of a total of 5? previously issued
recommendations. Management had suf?ciently implemented, partially resolved, or is in "the
.__process of addressing 54, or 95 percent of the prior reeommendations. Moreover, we recognize
that the ilimilementation rate achieved is a test'alricnt to elected of?cials and managementTs
desire and willingness to improve the ri?s'lc enviror?nnent here in the county, despite reduced
resources. Listed below is a status of the reriommendations addressed during 2018.-

 

 

'l'rainitrg Goals Achieved

Ensuring that each audit protessional staff member receives the required continuing
professional education credits and training is essential for any effective internal audit
organization; especially those peer reviewed such as the (DAG. Dining; the year. the OAG
provided education and training opportunities to each professional audit staff member. This
training enstu'es each staff member receives the proper continued prolessional. education credits
of 80 hours (every two years) required under the Generally Accepted Government Auditing
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. During the year
we also ensure staff obtains the required training to perform audits in accordance with the
international Standards for Professional Practice of internal Auditing issued by the Institute of
internal Auditors and the American institute of Iertitied Public Accountants.

We believe staff development is a continumis process that benefits both the staffand county by
ensuring staff enhance their skills and stay abreast of current industry guidance and best
practices. See Appendix A for a detailed listing of seminars and conferences attended by staff
during the year. Much of the training received during the year was obtained through vvebinars,
webcastsa and onlinc tutorials. This -'as done to control our expenditures in this area.

communities were at risk to have these funds recaptured .il?they were not spent timely.

Also: the DAG identified that the existing allocation methodology that had not been t'lpdated in
several years may not be addressing the three national objectives set l?orth by HUD for the
program. Finally, the monitoring of the program through county management can he
improved to assist the lo ?al communities in allocating and spending grant monies more

"I?wo attributes that assure the success and credibility of the Office Auditor ("iencrai

perspective of indepemiency in fact and appearance from the processes employed, the results,
conclusions and reporting of engagements and projects performed under the scope of authority.
"these parameters are set forth in the Wayne County Charter Section 39 and Wayne County
Code of Ordinances Chapter 65 and are applied to the OAG functions and auditors who are
involved in the activities prescribed.

The Auditor General shall be appointed by a majority of the Commissioners serving. "the
Auditor General may be removed for cause by a 28 vote of the serving. The
Auditor Generai reports directly to the Chairs of the Audit and the Wayne County

Along with the structure as outlined above, the GAO assures this concept as it applies to the
internal audit function on an annual basis and/or as required. These elements joined together
must meet the requirement for Organizational Independence required under Standard 1 10 of the
International Standards for the Protessional Practice of Internal Auditing as issued by the
Institute of Internal Auditors.

POSSIBLE ORGANIZATIONAL IMPAIRMENTS TO THE INDPENDENCE

I have reviewed the activities, functions, organizational structure, and reporting lines with

respect to Wayne County and its departments, elected of?cials, component units, agencies,
programs, and processes. I. am not aware of any circumstances that might impair or lead others
to question the ability to be independent, impartial, and objective on any
audit/engagement, except as indicated above. Therefore, any potential impairment listed above
are areas that the OAG does not engage.

RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE THIS DISCLOSURE

I understand that I am also responsible to make timely written noti?cation in the event any other
circumstance arises during the course of the year that. might impair or appear to impair the
independence with respect to an audit or activity this includes external impairments and
required disclosure related to non~audit service as noted in 3.44 of GAGAS and 1130 of the IIA
Standards.
