PROJECTS
640 Temple Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the 640 Temple Brownfield Plan. The development team provided
additional information regarding the project’s intended use and the history of the project
site.
Project Introduction
Temple Group Holdings, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which
entails the redevelopment of the current 169,337-square foot commercial building located
at 640 Temple Street and the adjacent vacant lot. The redevelopment encompasses
several components including 100-room key boutique hotel and hotel auxiliary facilities,
a restaurant and banquet facility, 70 residential apartments and a lounge/night club.

 The Property is located in Detroit’s Cass Park Historic District, on the west side of Detroit,
on the block bounded by Charlotte Street to the north, Second Avenue to the east, Temple
Street to the south and Third Avenue to the west.
The total investment is estimated to be $65 million. The Developer is requesting
$6,455,496.00 in TIF reimbursement, however only $5,100,380 in TIF Reimbursement is
projected to be captured for the life of the Plan.
There will be 158 Temporary construction jobs and 80 FTE jobs. The 80 FTE are expected
to be created over a 3 year period, once construction begins. The FTE jobs will include
managerial positions, housekeeping and janitorial staff, wait staff and desk attendants.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of four (4) parcels located at 640,650,660
and 674 Temple Street bounded by Charlotte Street to the north, Second Avenue to the
east, Temple Street to the south and Third Avenue to the west in Detroit’s Cass Park
Historic District.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized for a commercial purpose; (b) it is located within
the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property
is determined to be a facility as defined by Act 381.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include department
specific activities, site preparation, infrastructure improvements, demolition, lead and
asbestos abatement and development of a brownfield plan and work plan. The eligible
activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and
will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs
of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin in
the spring/summer of 2018 and be completed within eighteen (18) months.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

As a condition for approval of the Assignment, Assignee and the DBRA’s authorized

contemplated under the Development Agreement for consideration by the DBRA within
90 days of execution of the assignment. This approval was intended to come before the

for the delivery of the minimum requirements and milestones.
Mr. Scott asked for clarification on the expiration of the agreement. Mr. Walters and Ms.
Navin provided additional details regarding the request and stated that there was
progress being made with respect to the minimum requirements and milestones and that
the request before the Board today was an extension to provide that information per the
November 8, 2017 resolution approving the extension of the assignment and assumption
of the Agreement with the Developer to the Assignee.

Pullman Parc Approval of MDEQ Grant Application
Mr. Vosburg presented on the Pullman Parc MDEQ Grant Application.
The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (the “MDEQ”) recently received a
one-time allocation of $6 million in funds from the State of Michigan to offer statewide
environmental cleanup grants through their existing Brownfield Grant & Loan Program.
Grant funds are limited to a maximum of $1 million per project and applications are being
received on a first come, first awarded basis. Proposed projects must be able to start
construction no later than the Fall of 2018 and, at the time of application, have completed
environmental studies that are sufficient to determine the scope and budget of the
environmental cleanup needed for the site. No local match is required as part of this
grant application. Grant awards are expected to be announced within a month or two of
grant submission. Funds for successful grantees will be made available on a
reimbursement basis to the developer.
DBRA staff have discussed the grant program with DEGC staff, as well as the Jobs &
Economy Team staff, and feel that the Pullman Parc project is one of a very small number
of projects in the City well situated to take advantage of the grant program. The DBRA
will be allowed to take up to a 3% administrative fee to cover DBRA administrative costs
as well as the costs of a contractual environmental oversight professional that will work

 on behalf of the DBRA. The environmental oversight professional will be procured at a
later date if the DBRA is successful with this grant application.
A resolution supporting the submission of the Pullman Parc project to the MDEQ Grant &
Loan Program was attached for review and approval.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the developer could find a way to honor the history of the old
Friends School which use to be located at the project site. The developer advised that
they are hoping to keep the Pullman name to honor the Pullman Car Factory, but would
try and find a creative way to honor the school history as well.
Ms. McClain asked about the commitment to hiring Detroiters on the construction side.
The developer advised that they are committed to hiring Detroiters for both temporary
construction jobs and permanent positions.
Ms. Mays asked if they had complied with the executive orders in the past on previous
projects. The development team advised that they did not have any previous projects that
were subjective to executive orders.
Mr. George asked for clarification on how the grant proceeds would be managed by
DBRA. Mr. Vosburg advised that the DBRA would be the sponsor. The DBRA would
administer the funds and funds would be disbursed on a reimbursement basis with
concurrence from the MDEQ.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the submission of the Pullman Parc Project to
the MDEQ Grant & Loan Program. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. DeSantis, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code
18-02-130-16 was unanimously approved.
OTHER
Ms. Washington notified Mayoral appointees on the DBRA board that City Council will be
interviewing all Mayoral appointees for appointment and reappointment to the DBRA
board. Previously this step was not required for Mayoral appointees.
PUBLIC COMMENT
None
