M/W/DBE & Section 3 PARTICIPATION: To Be Determined
GENERAL BACKGROUND
Whenever federal funding sources that are listed under 24 CFR Part 58 are received and used by a public
housing authority (PHA) an environmental review is required. For CHA this environmental review is
required for all the work described in the annual Moving to Work Plan and it is anticipated that such
reviews will be a requirement of any subsequent agreement with HUD to expend federal funds. The
type of work includes administration of historic property agreements approved by the National Park
Services, acquisitions of new property, dispositions of existing CHA property, Rental Assistance
Demonstration (RAD) property transactions, new construction, certain modifications to existing
buildings, certain transactions under CHA’s Project Based Voucher (PBV) program, and any other
expenditure of federal funds not excluded under the regulations.
From 2001 to 2006 the City of Chicago was performing the required environmental reviews for CHA. In
2006, the responsibility for conducting the environmental reviews under NEPA was transferred to the
Illinois Office of HUD. HUD has informed CHA that they can no longer be responsible for the work
covered under NEPA due to personnel constraints and has asked CHA to enter into an agreement with
the City to perform the required review as the City had previously done. Pursuant to the Agreement,
the City will become the designated Responsible Entity for reviews required pursuant to 24 CFR Part 58.
As the Responsible Entity, the City will assume responsibility for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action that would otherwise be performed by HUD under NEPA and other provisions of
law that further the purposes of NEPA.
The estimated cost of $5,322,500 is based on CHA’s estimated budget for environmental services for
the next five years based on the five year budget submitted to the Office of Management and Budget.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Chicago
Housing Authority board policies and all applicable HUD procurement regulations.
The Office of the General Counsel and the Department of Procurement and Contracts concur with the
recommendation to enter into an IGA with the City of Chicago for a period of five (5) years with a funding
amount estimated to be $5,322,500.
The Chief Executive Officer recommends the approval to 1) enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City of Chicago acting through its Department of Fleet And Facility Management or other
designated City of Chicago department for a period of five (5) years; 2) commit Chicago Housing
Authority (CHA) funds not to exceed $5,322,500 for the environmental review of CHA projects requiring
environmental review under NEPA in compliance with 24 CFR Part 58; 3) execute and deliver such other
documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.
