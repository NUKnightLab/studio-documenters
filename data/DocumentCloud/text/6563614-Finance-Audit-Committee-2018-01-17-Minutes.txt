INFORMATION ITEMS

Craig Richmond, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Of?cer provided an overview of the
2017 Unaudited Financial and Operational Results. Mr. Richmond reported that Adjusted Earnings
before Interest, Depreciation and Amortization for the twelve months ended December
31, 2017 was $96.1 million, an increase of $35.1 million over the prior year twelve months ended
December 31, 2016 which had an EBIDA of $60.9 million.

Mr. Richmond further reported that total operating income for the twelve months ended December
31, 2017 was $41.5 million, compared with operating income of $8.6 million in 2016, a $32.9
million year?overayear increase. Both EBIDA and operating income growth were mainly attributed
to enhanced access with new ambulatory sites and freestanding emergency departments, expansion
in retail and contracted pharmacy operations, and population health initiatives.

Total operating revenue in 2017 was $1,127.8 million as compared to prior year~to?date total
operating revenue of $1,041.5 million which was an increase of 8.3 percent. The revenue growth is
attributable to both an increase in net patient service revenue of $68.3 million or 7.6 percent and an
increase in other operating revenue of $18.0 million or 12.3 percent mainly driven by growth in retail
and contract pharmacy and value?based programs.

Mr. Richmond reported that during 2017, the System experienced an overall improvement in payer
mix due to the integration and retention of former patients in 2016. This change in
payer mix contributed approximately $8.4 million in additional revenues for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2017. Inpatient case mix index for 2017 was 1.59, an increase of 0.02
from the CMI in 2016 which was 1.57. The increase in patient acuity contributed approximately

$5.2 million of net patient service revenue. The Medicare CMI increased to 1.79 in 2017 as
compared to 1.75 in 2016.

Mr. Richmond noted the System recorded total expenses of 81,0863 million in the twelve months
ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 81,0328 million in 2016, which was an increase of $53.5
million or 5.2 percent. Most of the increase was in salary and wages for additional staff to
accommodate former patients. Overall, the total expenses compared favorably to total
operating revenue increase of $86.3 million.

Mr. Richmond mentioned that Geoff Himes, Vice President of Finance would provide a review of
the accounting treatment for GASB Statement No. 68 Accounting and Financial Reporting for
Pensions.

Mr. Richmond proceeded with reviewing the Statement of Net Position as of December 31, 2017,
stating total assets increased signi?cantly from the prior year-end due to the 2017 bond issuance
proceeds. Other areas of note were the $9.4 million increase in net patient accounts receivable which
was attributed to an increase in the average net patient service revenue per day and a $27.4 million
increase in investments which was mainly attributed to an increase in the money market account
holdings. Similar to total assets, total liabilities increased signi?cantly from prior year-end balances
which was mainly due to the 2017 bond issuance.

Mr. Richmond reviewed Unrestricted Cash and Investment balances, noting that the 2017 year?end
balance had increased approximately $40.0 million compared to last year. Regarding MetroHealth?s
bond covenants and rating agency median ratios, I eff Kerkay, Treasurer shared that the System?s
bond covenants (days cash on hand and minimum debt service coverage ratio) are within
compliance. Lastly, the Advisory Board Credit Rating Strength Diagnostic Tool was reviewed
which measures the system?s ?nancial metrics against benchmarks derived from hospital medians of
the maj or credit rating agencies.

Geoff Himes, Vice President of Finance provided an overview of the 2017 Capital Spend and
process. Mr. Himes shared how the capital spend is focused on new services, access and strategy
initiatives, and routine/replacement capital is analyzed through the lens of the Campus
Transformation. In addition, Mr. Himes stated that the capital process has been redesigned over the
years resulting in a signi?cant improvement in the execution of capital projects.

Mr. Himes then provided a review of GASB Statement No. 68 - Accounting and Financial Reporting
for Pensions, stating the GASB 68 adj ustment is recorded on an annual basis using OPERS actuary
reports. Mr. Himes reiterated from prior discussions the liabilities recognized under GASB 68 meet
the de?nition of a liability for accounting standards. Mr. Himes mentioned that although
the pension liabilities recognized in accordance with GASB Statement No. 68 meet the de?nition of
a liability in its conceptual framework for accounting standards, they do not represent legal claims on
the System?s resources, and there are no cash ?ows associated with the recognition of net pension
liabilities, deferrals and expense.
