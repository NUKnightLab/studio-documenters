Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety (continued)
During the discussion of the update on ED throughput data, Chairman Michael inquired as to which is the best
source of data that shows whether the System is getting better or not. Dr. Das responded that this subject is one
that staff is currently working on. She stated that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) wants
to know that there is a clear indicator from a provider that the patient was seen. What the System has been
using is data from when the provider enters the note, when they actually do their documentation - that is what is
reported on Hospital Compare; however, in the System’s busy emergency rooms, the patient can be seen and the
note entered later, perhaps an hour later, so that could be artificially adding to the data on wait times. She noted
that they are planning to use data from when the provider signs up for the patient, because it is known that the
patient is in the bed. She stated that they will also be abstracting the same time point for the CMS submissions,
so there will be alignment in the System’s data reporting.
Chairman Michael inquired whether there are certain factors that slow down critical decisions in the ED. Dr.
Das indicated that, although she has not looked at this question scientifically, she would surmise that testing and
consultations are two possible factors. She noted that the System’s patients are extremely acute when they
present, so the ED rightfully obtains consultations from a variety of specialists; it takes time for that second
evaluation to take place and decisions to be delivered.
The Committee discussed the subject of the types of patients who present in the ED. Director Velasquez
inquired whether anything in the report reflects the difference between the critical patients and the number of
primary care patients who really should not be in the ED, if their needs are not urgent. Dr. Das stated that staff
from the ED have successfully implemented a number of initiatives to address this subject. Ms. Merryweather
added that there are a number of options that could be reviewed. One option would be to set up clinics right
next to the ED so that patients can be triaged; the administration may want to take a look at the model that
Ingalls Hospital has set up, as that model is quite successful. Ms. Merryweather added that there are a number
of universities nearby who have engineers that go out to hospitals to assist and work with the clinical team in
reviewing and finding solutions for matters such as this.
Chairman Michael stated that this review and discussion has been helpful to understand how complex this issue
is; the most important thing is to have the exact data on how long patients are waiting to get the care that they
need, and what are the things that can be done with the resources that are available to reduce those wait times.
He indicated that he thinks the System is moving in the right direction.
The Committee discussed the information regarding the Ambulatory Patient Satisfaction Survey. Dr. Enrique
Martinez, Medical Director of Outpatient Services, and Dr. Stephen Stabile, Chair of the ACHN Quality
Council, provided additional information on the subject.
Subjects reviewed included the following: importance of measuring patient satisfaction; process used to
measuring patient satisfaction; aggregate data and top box analysis - access; aggregate data and top box analysis
- throughput; aggregate data - overall assessment; issues/efforts to date; and future directions.
During the discussion, Dr. Das stated that she believes one of the issues impacting the survey results is related to
staffing. There have been a lot of retirements, and at the same time, the administration has tried to expand the
Ambulatory capacity – there is an issue of balance between those two. Another issue relates to the training of
staff, in terms of customer service; she noted that there is a patient experience initiative that is just starting to
take off. Dr. Martinez stated that he believes the survey reflects some real issues, and there is no question that
access issues are a challenge for patients in the System. Wait times at the clinics need to improve; there are
capacity issues with respect to those services that do not have enough capacity to meet the demand for services.
He stated that, with respect to wait times, they have improved in the last couple of years; there are several
clinics where the wait times have been reduced to close to benchmark levels. The data for all of the clinics has

Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety (continued)
been tracked over the last couple of years; however, even though the data shows that these wait times are
improving, it is not reflected in the survey results - so the survey results reflect that the patients do not perceive
that. A lot of the data is electronic, and should be relatively accurate, but somehow even though improvement is
seen, it is not translating to a more positive survey. Actions need to continue to reduce those wait times even
more, and to work on reducing backlogs. With regard to the issue that the patients are not happy with the
phone communications, Dr. Martinez stated that this data has been also been tracked for the last couple of years;
based on that data, this has improved, but the improvement is not reflected in the survey results. He suggested
that, for future surveys, more effort could be made to focus on urging patients to complete and return the survey.
Dr. Stabile stated that a tool called the C-Map is currently being implemented; this is a registry that helps care
teams at the sites that are oriented around a specific panel of patients, which is attached to a provider or several
providers. That team has specific roles and tasks; there are very clear roles between the licensed members of
the team. They are in the process of forming those teams to address this in a real way. No patient at his site
walks out without knowing who their care team, or “go-to” people are; their physician, nurse care manager and
care coordinator (usually a clerk or medical assistant) are identified. The technology is coming along to support
this team-based care, and it will hopefully be implemented across all of the sites.
With regard to the subject of identifying those patients who are receiving emergency care and following up after
that, Dr. Stabile stated that, as the System is participating in the medical home network, which is growing quite
quickly, this will allow staff to know when the System’s primary care patients present at any of the hospitals
participating in it.
Dr. Stabile stated that it has been known for many years that there are a number of barriers to access, including
phone access and in-person access. Staff is currently in the process of working to completely redesign how
access is viewed at the sites. As staffing improves, and team members fulfill their roles, staff can continue to
move the care of the patients outside of just that ten minute provider visit that happens on some regular basis, to
not only other times, but with all other team members. The patients that are served, and in particular the adult
patients, are fairly complex – these are folks who have very complex diseases. There is a lot of work that has to
be done at a fairly intense level with the patients to help them start embracing self-management of their disease,
and setting goals for their disease; care management is being incorporated as part of the patient-centered
medical home team, so there will be time spent with patients outside of the provider visit. They are also
completely re-vamping how scheduling is done. He noted that there were approximately eight hundred
different types of appointments in the scheduling system, which created huge barriers; they are now really
simplifying how scheduling is going to be done, so the clinics are accommodating patients when the patients
want to be seen. Probably the biggest piece that still needs a lot of work is around the phone access. The sites
have been working very hard at answering the phone and being responsive to the patients, but Dr. Stabile
believed that some system issues remain at some of the sites that have prevented them from doing that.
Additionally, part of his vision is that by the end of 2013, extended hours will need to be in place. Late night
and early morning hours are offered at the sites; however, they consist of eight hour days, and consistent
weekend hours exist at only one of the sites - as the staffing improves, access should be provided to patients
during times that are outside of the traditional work hours.
Director Muñoz stated that, because this report contains composite data, there is a sense of the whole, but there
is not a sense of which site is performing well and which is not. Dr. Das responded that there is a small
difference, but if one looks at the percentile rankings, there is not a lot of variation between the clinics; she
added that she can send him the entire report. Director Muñoz indicated that one of the things he want to look at
is if the System is doing something well at some of the clinics, how can that be translated to other sites and into
meaningful change for the other clinics?

Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety (continued)
Chairman Michael indicated that this is a complex situation; these results should be viewed as a call to action to
do something now to improve the care and access that patients are receiving in the clinics across the board. As
the System is moving into a much more competitive world, if it does not want to find itself in a position where
all of the patients that have some sort of coverage in the future are choosing to go elsewhere, this needs to be
taken very seriously.
On the question of what to read into the numbers, Chairman Michael stated that, frankly, it is the only data
available. Access is an important issue, but when one views these results, he would say that there are some
other big issues that need to be addressed. In the area of courtesy, or the interactions of the staff in the clinics
and patients, according to the survey, patients feel like they are not treated with courtesy or respect, and that is a
big problem. With regard to access, it is access in many different facets – getting appointments, having a call
back when a patient cannot reach someone on the telephone to get the appointment, having the appointment
occur soon after the patient makes the call, and time that it takes to be seen when the patient comes to the clinic
- all of those things are big issues. The System has great medical staff - but in the world that is evolving around
the System, if patients cannot get in to receive their care easily, they will go somewhere else. He added that,
alternatively, one of the outcomes could be that if patients cannot get into the clinics, get an appointment, be
seen with respect, and receive good care, they may go to the emergency room instead of going to the clinics.
