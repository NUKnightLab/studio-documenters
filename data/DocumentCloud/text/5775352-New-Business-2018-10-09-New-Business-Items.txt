2018 Programming Beacon Park 

 OF THE ARTWORK

Name: Prismati ca

Type: Interactive light installation
Location: Outdoors Indoors
Description:

A modern ice palace. Prismatica turns heads with the countless colourful reflections made by its
giant prisms. Visitors can walk among them to see city life in every colour of the spectrum, and
turn the prisms to make the colours dance. After sunset, the enormous interactive kaleidoscope's
illusory effects reach a crescendo.

Prismatica is a participatory installation comprising 25 pivoting prisms more than two meters tall.
Each one is made of panels covered with a dichroic film that reflects the colours of the rainbow,
varying with the light source and viewing angle. Each prism is mounted on a base containing a
projector that gives the installation a new dimension after nightfall. The rotation of the prisms
triggers variable-intensity bell music.
