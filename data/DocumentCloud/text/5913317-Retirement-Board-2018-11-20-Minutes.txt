Mr. Walsh presented a memo from the Fund’s Legislative Liaison. See attached. Mr. Walsh then reported
that instead of accepting or overriding the Governor’s amendatory veto of House Bill 4811, the House has
instead introduced and passed a new bill, HB 166, to replace HB 4811. Mr. Walsh noted that HB 116 is
identical to HB 4811 except that the new bill excludes the one sentence in HB 4811 that the Governor
vetoed. Mr. Walsh stated that the veto session resumes November 27, 2018 at which time the Bill may be
voted on by the Senate.
2019 Financing Request (Tax Levy)
Mr. Walsh reported that he had received a response to the letter the Fund sent to the City of Chicago’s (“City”)
Office of Budget Management (OBM) requesting clarification regarding how the various components of
LABF’s financing request were being addressed in the City’s Budget Recommendation for 2019. The Trustees
asked Mr. Walsh to quantify what the “loss” associated with the tax levy collection has been over the last 10
years and report back to the Board at the next regular meeting. This topic was deferred to the December 18th
Board meeting.
