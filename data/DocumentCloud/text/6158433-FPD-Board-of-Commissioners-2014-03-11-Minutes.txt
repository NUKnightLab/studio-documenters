PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
Department(s): Resource Management
Summary: Powderhorn Marsh and Prairie Nature Preserve received Bronze Accreditation through
Chicago Wilderness’ Excellence in Ecological Restoration Program (“EERP”).
The Chicago Wilderness Excellence in Ecological Restoration Program (EERP) is a program designed to
recognize high-quality restoration sites and develop professional standards of excellence in natural
resource management and ecological restoration. The primary purpose of the EERP is to promote best
management practices in order to improve ecological restoration management efforts in the Chicago
region and across the nation. The Program combines a rigorous, standards-based approach with a
voluntary, comprehensive assessment process to recognize high-quality sites and the organizations that
manage them.
Page 20 of 54

 FPD Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

March 11, 2014

The benefits of participating in the EERP go beyond simply restoring the ecological health of a particular
site. Participation in the EERP provides agencies with opportunities for self-assessment and demonstrates
on the ground commitment to Chicago Wilderness’s Biodiversity Recovery Plan. It also provides an
opportunity to update and clarify policies and procedures in order to ensure that demonstrated practices
are in alignment with existing policies and procedures. The EERP outlines professional standards for both
internal and external comparisons, thereby raising the credibility for agencies engaged in restoring sites.
Powderhorn Marsh and Prairie Nature Preserve is a 192-acre preserve located in the Calumet region of
southeastern Cook County, primarily in the Village of Burnham but with select portions within the
Chicago city limits. Lying within the Lake Michigan watershed, the site is a remarkable remnant of
dune-and-swale habitat and a shallow, naturalized lake. It has been identified as an Illinois Natural Areas
Inventory site, and 130 acres are dedicated as a State Nature Preserve by the Illinois Nature Preserves
Commission.
Powderhorn Marsh and Prairie Nature Preserve holds significant biodiversity and six state-listed plant and
animal species. The site reflects the unusual plant communities’ characteristic of sandy dune-and-swale
remnants: black oak barrens, dry, mesic, and wet sand prairies, sedge meadows, and emergent wetlands.
Because of its proximity to Lake Michigan, Powderhorn Marsh and Prairie Nature Preserve is also
recognized and managed as a critical migratory bird stop-over site.

PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
Department(s): Resource Management
Summary: The Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “Preserves”) has won Conservation and
Native Landscaping awards which recognizes sites and projects within the Chicago region that
demonstrates exemplary use of native landscaping ecosystem restoration and protection. The awards are
for the following sites:
Edgebrook Woods Demonstration Site
In 2007, Friends of the Chicago River partnered with the Preserves to establish long-term restoration
practices at Edgebrook Woods, located along the North Branch of the Chicago River in Chicago. The
partners created a site management plan to improve the riverbank and upland conditions and address the
impacts of storm water runoff. Friends of the Chicago River organized volunteer workdays to remove
non-native plants, create multiple rain gardens, collect and disperse local native seeds, establish new
Page 21 of 54

Journal of Proceedings

March 11, 2014

habitats, and monitor species. Since 2007, more than 1,300 volunteers have logged approximately 5,000
hours and learned simple at-home actions they can take to manage storm water.
Thatcher Woods Savanna Restoration Project
A tiny remnant with a once small and closed savanna, Thatcher Woods Savanna is now a thriving
five-acre prairie and open savanna with rebounding plant populations. The Preserves restored the site by
removing invasive buckthorn, conducting prescribed burns, and monitoring rare plant species. The
Thatcher complex has more than 250 native plant species and includes one of the only remaining
examples of quality floodplain forest left in the Northeastern Morainal Division of Illinois. For
surrounding suburban communities such as River Forest and Melrose Park, Thatcher Woods provides a
refuge and a place for walking and learning about nature, especially when interpreted by the naturalists at
the nearby Hal Tyrrell Trailside Museum of Natural History. As habitat continues to improve, the
experience will only grow richer for visitors.
Theodore Stone Preserve
After 20 years of restoration, Theodore Stone Preserve-a formerly degraded woodland and brushed-over
prairie-now supports a spectacular mix of restored remnant mesic oak woodland, mesic prairie, dolomite
prairie, and marshland communities. In part because of its rare dolomite prairie, the 135-acre preserve is a
natural area of regional importance and is home to several threatened and endangered species. Several
years ago, the Preserves worked with the Village of Hodgkins, Friends of the Forest Preserves and others
to eliminate parking lot runoff that had created a 20-foot-deep erosion gully through one of the preserve’s
wooded bluffs and was polluting the dolomite prairie below. The Preserves then filled the gully and
restored the area. Staff, contractors, and extremely dedicated volunteers undertook intense restoration
efforts, and Theodore Stone Preserve now plays a role in improved air and water quality as well as flood
control, provides opportunities for outdoor recreation and respite, conserves critical habitat for wildlife,
increases local property values, and raises the overall quality of life for people who live and work in the
area.

5-2A-3: TERM OF LICENSE.
All licenses issued to entities that fall into this category will not exceed a ten-year term, unless
otherwise approved by the Board based upon District staff recommendations for a license
exceeding twenty-five acres and/or when in staff opinion the license can generate additional
revenue for the District. Said term will commence when said license is executed by the President
of the Board of Forest Preserve District Commissioners.
5-2A-4: LICENSE FEE.
In addition to those special fees as may be recommended by District staff, the fee for licenses
issued under this Article will be determined by multiplying the acres used by the cost per acre.
Acres used will be calculated by multiplying the linear footage shown on the license application
(or revised application) by the width required for future maintenance of the facilities. The
minimum width will be fifteen (15) feet for all licenses regardless of the facilities installed or
location of said facilities. Requests for widths above fifteen (15) feet must include an explanation
justifying the need for additional width. The minimum license fee will be five (5) percent of the
cost per acre for the current year. Additionally, a Youth Education, Land Acquisition and
Restoration (YELAR) Program Fee of five (5) percent of the cost per acre shall be assessed
against all licenses issued. Cost per acre, minimum license fee and YELAR program fee figures
can be found in Appendix A at the end of this Article. All fees due will be paid as a lump-sum upfront one-time payment, unless otherwise approved by the Board.
….
5-2A-6: RENEWAL OF EXISTING LICENSES.
Any license previously issued by the FPD that expires while this Article is in force will be
renewed at a rate fifty (50) percent lower than that specified for issuance of a new license, unless
otherwise approved by the Board based upon District staff recommendations for a license
exceeding twenty-five acres and/or when in staff opinion the license can generate additional
revenue for the District. The minimum renewal license fee will be five (5) percent of the cost per
acre for the current year. Additionally, a Youth Education, Land Acquisition and Restoration
(YELAR) Program Fee of five (5) percent of the cost per acre shall be assessed against all
licenses issued. Cost per acre, minimum license fee and YELAR program fee figures can be
found in Appendix A at the end of this Article. The Licensee must submit a non-refundable
license renewal application fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to the FPD six (6) months prior
to the expiration date of said license to confirm its interest in continued operation and
maintenance of the facilities for which the license was originally issued. If the applicable license
renewal application fee and prior notice of the Licensee's intent to renew is not received by the
FPD at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the existing license, the FPD will mail the
Licensee a "Removal Notice" at their last known address notifying the licensee to remove their
facilities from FPD property. If the Licensee wishes to renew a license for which it has already
received a "Removal Notice" the FPD will allow the renewal but the fee for the renewal will be
based on the formula used to determine the fee for issuance of a new license. All fees due for
license renewals will be paid as a lump-sum upfront one-time payment, unless otherwise
approved by the Board.
5-2A-7: EXPIRATION OF THIS ARTICLE.
This Article will expire on December 31, 2024. Any license previously issued by the FPD that
expires after the expiration of this Article and before a replacement Article has been adopted shall
be automatically renewed for one (1) period(s) until a replacement Article is adopted. The fee for
any extended year period shall be calculated as established in paragraph 5-2A-4 using a cost per
acre of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) higher than the previous year.

All licenses issued to entities that fall into this category will be issued for a continuous term,
unless otherwise approved by the Board based upon District staff recommendations when in staff
opinion the license can generate additional revenue for the District. Said term will commence
when said license is executed by the President of the Board of Forest Preserve District
Commissioners and would continue as long as the licensee complies with the terms and
conditions set forth in the license. Any License not issued for a continuous term may be renewed
in accordance with Title 5-2A-6 of this Code.
5-2B-4: LICENSE FEE.
In addition to those special fees as may be recommended by District staff, the fee for licenses
issued under this Article will be determined by multiplying the acres used by the cost per acre.

2-5-1: PURPOSE
A. In 1913, the Illinois General Assembly authorized the creation of County Forest Preserve
Districts, and granted the Commissioners thereof, the specific power: "To acquire and hold lands
containing natural forests, or lands connecting such forests for the purpose of protecting and
preserving the flora, fauna and scenic beauties, and to restore, restock, protect and preserve the
natural forests and said lands, together with their flora and fauna, as nearly as may be, in their
natural state and condition, for the purpose of the education, pleasure and recreation of the
public."
B. The Forest Preserve District is the single largest land owner in Cook County and has acquired
to date, a system of forested lands and lands connecting them, totaling 68,000 acres, in
accordance with Illinois State Statute 70 ILCS 810 which currently allows for the maximum
acquisition of a total of 75,000 acres.
C. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to establish rules and regulations governing the authorized
conveyance of Forest Preserve lands. The Board of Commissioners finds that such rules and
regulations are required in order to protect and preserve the property, natural areas, forests, trees,
vegetation, wildlife, scenic beauties, natural resources, flora and fauna, facilities and
improvements of the District.
Except for those permits issued pursuant to Title 2, Title 6 and Title 7 of this Code, this
ordinance shall apply to all persons, firms, partnerships, companies, corporations, municipalities,
municipal corporations, special districts, school districts, units of local government, the Federal
Government, and the State of Illinois (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Applicant") that
desire to use, or seek ownership of any property of the District.

Journal of Proceedings

March 11, 2014

During the mid-80’s, Preserves staff undertook a comprehensive study of all Preserves holdings, resulting
in a list of 30 parcels being considered for disposal. Subsequently, the Preserves sought and obtained
permission, on 9/23/1985 via Public Act 84-867, from the State Legislature to offer 27 of the 30
aforementioned parcels for sale, including Surplus Parcel 1, with the monies to accrue to the Preserves’
Real Estate Acquisition Fund. On 8/16/2001, via Public Act 92-0403, the State Legislature authorized the
sale of an additional 5 surplus parcels including Surplus Parcel E.
The Village of Elmwood Park (the “Buyer”), has agreed to buy the Surplus Parcels from the Preserves for
the sum of TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND 00/100 ($250,000.00). The
Preserves has obtained M.A.I. certified appraisals for each of the Surplus Parcels. The purchase price
reflects the combined purchase price of the Surplus Parcels and is consistent with the appraisals received
for those individual parcels.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REPURPOSING THE WATCHMAN’S HOUSE AT 87TH AND BEVERLY AVENUE IN THE
DAN RYAN FOREST PRESERVES
WHEREAS, the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “Preserves”) watchman’s house at 87th

WHEREAS, the Dan Ryan Preserves has another watchman’s house located at 91st and Longwood
Drive, which is approximately one half mile away from the house located at 87th and Beverly Avenue;
and
WHEREAS, the watchman’s house at 87th and Beverly Avenue is conveniently located along the Major
Taylor Bicycle Trail. Marshall Walter “Major” Taylor was an American cyclist who won the world
1-mile track cycling championship in 1899 after setting numerous world records and overcoming racial
discrimination; and
WHEREAS, this unfortunate property damage at the watchman’s house located on 87th and Beverly Ave
provides a unique opportunity for the Preserves to explore alternative use for the structure; and
WHEREAS, with the support of the local community and elected officials and with the identification of
the appropriate funds, the watchman’s house located at 87th and Beverly Ave. can become a new public
destination for the Preserves; and,
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Real Estate Committee of the Forest Preserve
District of Cook County Board of Commissioners requests that the Superintendent of the Preserves,
and/or his designee, examine the cost and benefit of removing the watchman’s house located at 87th and
Beverly from the Preserve’s Resident Watchman program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it is also requested that the Superintendent of the Preserves, and/or
