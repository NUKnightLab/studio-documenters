Action Items
A.

Approval of proposed CCHHS FY2019 Preliminary Budget (continued)

Director Reiter commented that he has reviewed this presentation a number of times and chaired two (2) public
hearings on it, and believes that it is remarkable what this organization accomplishes in fulfilling its mission. An
attendee of one of the public hearings who has an extensive background in public policy offered a comment to him
after the hearing about how they were amazed at the work that is done here; this type of effort is not seen anywhere
else in the country. This health system that includes public hospitals, a network of clinics, a correctional health
facility and a public health department is running successfully with less and less money coming in directly from the
County. He fully stands behind this budget, and he commits himself as a Director and Finance Chair to pass this
today and get it integrated into the County’s proposed budget.
Director Thomas stated that he will vote for the budget; however, he expressed his interest in receiving more detail.
He stated that it is great to grow the CountyCare membership, but the Board does not have a projection of the number
of CountyCare members to keep in this System to make it profitable for the System – it would be good to consider
what is the goal for keeping folks in the System for their primary care. Additionally, he referenced the progress
being made with updating some of the clinics; he believes that some of the south side clinics need some loving care
and new facilities.
With regard to the information on slide 14, pertaining to FY2019 Proposed External Revenue by Source, Director
Gugenheim inquired regarding the figure of $494 million in patient fees; she asked what percentage of that figure is
Medicare? Mr. Akpan responded that he estimates it to be approximately 12-15%, but he can provide the exact
amount following the meeting. Dr. Shannon stated that he believes that it amounts to approximately 14%; he offered
to follow up with a deep dive review on the subject in the future. Director Gugenheim noted that the slide would be
improved if percentages are included.
Chair Hammock noted for the record that he supports the budget; there are always difficult choices to be made, but
he thinks the organization is moving in the right direction.
Director Munar remarked that, because the architecture of the budget is so fragile, and so much depends on
enrollments and reimbursement rates, the Board will have to carefully monitor the projections and assumptions in
the outlier years.
Director Reiter, seconded by Director Thomas, moved the approval of the proposed CCHHS
FY2019 Preliminary Budget. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

entered into the minutes of the closed meeting,” 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(12), regarding “the

specialty, a hospital must excel in caring for the sickest, most medically complex patients. cardiology team is led

Dr. Vamsi Kodumuri, Director of Heart Failure Registry and Regeena Francis, DNP.

Patient Experience

Theresa Johnson, a mammography technician at Stroger Hospital, was recently recognized at the 
leadership meeting for going above and beyond the call. Theresa used a questioning and compassionate attitude while
talking to a patient, which helped save a life. The patient revealed that she wanted to kill herself and took a number of
pills prior to her appointment. Ms. Johnson immediately notified her supervisor and assisted in escorting the patient to
the ER, where the patient was admitted.

Legislative pdate

State

Federal

Governor Rauner signed legislation to strengthen existing state statute concerning flu shots for
healthcare employees (Public Act 100-1020) on August 22, which serves as the effective date. The bill was
unanimously approved by both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly. H32984 specifies that ?general
philosophical or moral reluctance? are not acceptable reasons to seek an exemption from a healthcare
institution?s shot policy. The bill also codifies existing provisions that allow for exemptions due to religious
beliefs or medical contraindication. Representative Marcus Evans and Senator Bill Cunningham served as the
Chief Sponsors of H32984 and helped lead passage of this legislation.

In July, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) received federal approval to implement
?Integrated Health Homes? or IHHs. are intended to provide care coordination for Medicaid beneficiaries
across their physical, behavioral and social care needs. HFS held town halls earlier this month to share more
information about IHHs, and has published an online schedule of webinars. An estimated 250,000?300,000
high?need Medicaid beneficiaries are expected to be enrolled with an IHH effective January 1, 2019.

The Illinois General Assembly Fall Veto Session is scheduled for November 13-15 and November 27?29.

The House of Representatives wrapped up its work on July 26, leaving for the traditional August recess until
September 4. Meanwhile Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell kept the Senate in session through most of
the month to focus on appropriations and nominations.

Efforts to chip away at the Affordable Ca re Act (ACA) and counter-efforts to protect it continued in late July

and into August.

0 Risk Adjustment Payments On July 24 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final
rule to clarify program methodology and address issues raised by the courts and clear the way for payments
to resume. The original freeze in July caught insurers by surprise, adding to uncertainty around the ACA
individual markets.

0 Association Health Plans On July 26, twelve state Attorneys General (AG) sued the U.S. Department of
Labor over its new rules relaxing the requirements for Association Health Plans under ERISA (Employee
Retirement Income Security Act). The AGs not including Illinois argue that the new rules will undermine
the insurance markets and consumer protections in their states.

0 Short-Term Plans - On August 1, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a final rule
expanding the availability of short-term plans. The rule would permit people to enroll in short?term plans for
up to a year and renew for up to three years. While they can be inexpensive, these plans can skirt ACA rules
on essential benefits, guaranteed issue, community rating, etc. Some state insurance regulators are moving
to limit or even ban short-term plans.

I On August 21, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing to examine 
efforts to fight Medicaid fraud and overpayments. CMS Administrator Seema Verma and the Comptroller General of
the U.S. Gene Dodaro testified. In an exchange with Chairman Ron Johnson Administrator Verma reiterated
her belief that the Medicaid program was at risk for fraud and abuse because of its ?open ended entitlement"
structure. In addition to promoting work requirements, she suggested fundamental changes to the program (like
block grants or caps) to address the risk. The testimony brought by Comptroller General Dodaro, who leads the
investigative arm of Congress, the Government Accountability Office, highlights their view that the ways that states

4 Page

and local governments ?nance Medicaid supplemental payments requires additional scrutiny. Chairman Johnson
was more direct, referring to the financing mechanisms as gimmicks or schemes and promising additional hearings.

In the middle of August, Senate leaders began the process of bringing the FY 2019 Labor-HHS-Education
appropriations bill to the Senate floor. They decided to package it together with the FY 2019 Department of Defense
appropriations bill, calling it Minibus 3. On August 23 the Senate passed the appropriations bill (HR. 6157) with a
85?7 bi-partisan vote. The bill did not include any controversial policy riders. The House has not yet passed their
appropriation bill.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
