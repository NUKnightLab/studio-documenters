PROPOSED AGREEMENT

Transmitting a Communication, dated June 14, 2001 from
WILLIAM R. MORAN, County Commissioner
Submitting a request from
TERRENCE BRIDE, Project Director, Flying J, Richton Park Travel Plaza
Re:

Intergovernmental Cooperation Agreement between Cook County and the Village of Richton
Park

Flying J has postponed development of our proposed Richton Park travel plaza due to the potential impact
of the Cook County Motor Fuels Taxes on our ability to compete successfully in the market. The current
6 cent per gallon county motor fuels tax is not applied in Will County just one mile to the south.
Recently we met with you and county staff to convey our concern and to request your assistance with
coordinating county mitigation of this large tax differential. A packet of information for the evaluation of
the Cook County Board of Commissioners and staff for their upcoming June 19th Board Meeting has
been submitted. This includes the following:
•

An introduction

•

A draft cooperative agreement

•

Fiscal Benefit Analysis

•

Project Tax Analysis

2111

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 19, 2001
The proposed cooperation agreement creates a mechanism which forwards nearly all of the dollars
collected through motor fuel s taxes to the Village to then be returned to Flying J as an economic
development incentive to locate in the Village of Richton Park.
It is our sincere desire that we find resolution to this issue as soon as possible. With the assistance of the
county our development may still become a reality benefiting all concerned.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved that the communication be referred
to the Committee on Finance (Comm. No. 244387) and the Committee on Business and Economic
Development (Comm. No. 244388). The motion carried unanimously.

equipment line items in the New Cook County Hospital Budget to the contract with Walsh/Riteway, Joint
Venture Construction Manager. It is respectfully requested that this honorable body approve this request.

electrical and fire alarm/firewall changes. Several of these changes are categorized as potential errors
and/or omissions. (Note that the County has a wrap-up insurance policy to cover professional liability).
Owner/User Requests - During the final design of the faci lity, hospital staff requested improvements to
the design for optimum functioning of the new hospital. Some of these requests included expansion of
the pneumatic tube system, changes to the bum unit, incorporation of additional dialysis facilities in
selected patient rooms and other changes.
Equipment Related Changes - The final preparation of the equipment bid packages has caused
refinements in the utility design of the building, therefore, additional electrical, mechanical and plumbing
work has to be added to the base design.
New Regulatory Requirements - The nature of a multi-year construction project is that there will be
regulatory code changes that must be accommodated before the faci lity opens. The changes requested
here pertain to the coding of fire and smoke dampers that was not required during initial code reviews.
A ll of the funds requested at this time will be allocated from the contingency line item and the equipment
line item in the budget. This budget was approved by the Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994.
