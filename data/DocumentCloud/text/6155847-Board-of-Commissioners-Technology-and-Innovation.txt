felony cases, 166,000 misdemeanor ?lings and over 750,000 traf?c cases, with over 78,000 jail admissions in ?scal
year; and

WHEREAS, a paper-based criminal justice system inhibits of?ces from effectively communicating with each
other, leading to errors and inef?ciencies that continue to cost the County dramatically; and

WHEREAS, the development and implementation of an automated criminal justice system that allows the Of?ce
of the Chief Judge, the Cook County Sheriff, the Cook County State?s Attorney, the Cook County Public Defender,
and the Clerk of the Circuit Court to remedy the above-mentioned errors and inef?ciencies by automatically
providing access to electronic documents to all effected of?ces and allowing for the accurate transmittal of
information pertaining to each defendant resulting in improvements to public safety as well as savings to the
County.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners and
the Cook County Board of Commissioners strongly support the development and implementation of an automated
criminal justice system; and

plan for the implementation of an integrated system.
