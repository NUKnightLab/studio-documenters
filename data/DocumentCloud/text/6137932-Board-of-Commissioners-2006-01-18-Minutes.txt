Transmitting a Communication, dated January 6, 2006 from
DANIEL H. WINSHIP, M.D., Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $6,118,574.00 and extend for eleven
(11) months, Contract No. 00-43-357, with The Foster Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, to provide
information systems services for Bureau of Health Services.
Reason:

As you will recall, on December 14, 2004, the Board of Commissioners approved a one (1)
year extension of The Foster Group, Inc. contract to allow sufficient time to evaluate the
information system needs of the Bureau of Health Services. Since that time, I have been
reviewing the internal operations and have focused a majority of my efforts on improving the
revenue cycle and identifying new opportunities to expand the revenue base. To date, much
of the effort has been devoted to standardizing registration and eligibility processes and
modifying the information systems that supports these functions.
In addition to these efforts, I appointed a committee that was given the responsibility to
develop a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the ongoing management and support of the
information systems functions for the Bureau of Health Services. This committee was
comprised of members from of the Department for Management of Information Systems,
Office of the Purchasing Agent, Office of the State's Attorney, and the Bureau of Health
Services hospitals and clinics. The committee interviewed other public hospital systems that
outsource the management and support of their IT operations, in an effort to identify
opportunities to improve the information system functions and provide measurable and well
defined performance requirements for the new contract. This group has completed its work
and has prepared an RFP document.
During the RFP development phase, we learned from discussions with other public hospitals
to allow for a minimum of a six month transition period. This would allow for a smooth
transition and minimize the high risk potential of business interruption associated with
changing vendors and will ensure continuity of hospital operations and revenue stream.
Based upon this information and the financial challenges we face this fiscal year I am
requesting a contract extension and authorization to issue an RFP for hospital management
information services. I have submitted a timeline of events that will conclude with the award
of a contract by June 30, 2006 and allow for the transition to the new contract by January 1,
2007. The expiration date of the current contract is January 31, 2006.
The Foster Group, Inc. has agreed to extend the contract at the current contract price.
Sufficient funds have been requested in the 2006 budget to cover these services.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $6,118,574.00. Contract extension: February 1, 2006 through December 31,
2006. (897-260 Account).

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the County Purchasing
Agent be authorized to increase and extend the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

POLICY
A.

Early Intervention and Education Prevention Strategies
1.

It is the policy of Cook County to use early intervention and prevention strategies in

order to avoid or minimize the occurrence and effects of domestic or sexual violence in
the workplace. Cook County will provide available support, assistance, and reasonable
accommodations, absent undue hardship, to employees who are survivors/victims of
domestic or sexual violence. Support and reasonable accommodations may include:
confidential means for coming forward for help, resource and referral information,
additional security at the workplace, work schedule adjustments or leave necessary to
obtain medical counseling or legal assistance, or workplace relocation if operations
permit. Cook County will attempt to make written and referral information available in
any language necessary. In all responses to domestic or sexual violence, Cook County
will respect the confidentiality and autonomy of the adult survivor/victim to direct her
or his own life, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
2.

Cook County will maintain, publish, and post in locations of high visibility, such as
bulletin boards and break rooms, health/first aid offices, County phone directories, and
online information data bases, a list of resources for survivors/victims and perpetrators
of domestic or sexual violence, including but not limited to the Illinois Coalition
Against Domestic Violence (217) 789-2830, the national domestic violence hotline
number (800) 799-SAFE, the number to the Employee Assistance Program (312) 2632747, and the phone numbers and descriptions of local domestic violence and sexual
assault resources. Cook County will also post a notice prepared by the Illinois
Department of Labor, summarizing the requirements of VESSA and information
pertaining to filing of a charge.

3.

Cook County shall train and educate its employees and managers about domestic and
sexual violence issues and this policy. This training and education may include:
a.

disseminating information in employee newsletters and other employee
communication materials;

b.

providing training and resources to supervisors and human resources
representatives to increase their awareness and ability to recognize domestic and
sexual violence issues, to help them deal with the issues appropriately in the
workplace and assist survivor/victims and/or abusers to access available services;
and

533

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 18, 2006
c.

B.

C.

incorporating information about domestic and sexual violence and the County
policy into the County's new employee/new supervisor orientation programs.

Leave Options for Employees Who are Survivors or Victims of Domestic or Sexual
Violence or Who Have a Family or Household Member Who is the Victim of Domestic
or Sexual Violence

1.

At times, an employee may need to be absent from work due to domestic or sexual
violence. When determining leave options, employees, supervisors and managers shall
comply with VESSA which allows, at minimum, a total of 12 unpaid work weeks of
leave during any 12-month period. The actual length of time should be determined by
the employee's situation. Extended time beyond the 12 weeks guaranteed by VESSA
shall be determined through collaboration with the employee, supervisor/manager,
human resources representative, and union representative, where the employee is
represented. Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule.

2.

Employees, supervisors, and managers are encouraged to first explore whether paid
options can be arranged that will help the employee cope with a family violence
situation without having to take a formal unpaid leave of absence. Depending on the
circumstances, and provided operations permit, these options may include: arranging
flexible work hours so that the employee can handle legal matters, court appearances,
housing, and childcare issues; and permitting use of sick leave, annual leave, shared
leave or compensatory time.

Procedures for Employees with Performance Issues Related to Domestic or Sexual
Violence

While the employer retains the right to discipline employees for cause, Cook County
recognizes that survi;vors/victims of domestic or sexual violence may have performance or
conduct problems such as chronic absenteeism or inability to concentrate as a result of the
violence. When an employee subject to discipline confides that the job performance or
conduct problem is caused by domestic or sexual violence, a referral for appropriate
assistance should be offered to the employee.
D.

Discrimination and Retaliation Protection for Employees Who are SurvivorsNictims of
Domestic or Sexual Violence or Who Have a Family or Household Member Who is the
Victim of Domestic or Sexual Violence

1.

In accordance with VESSA, Cook County shall not discriminate in the hiring process
or, refuse to hire, discharge, or harass any prospective employee or employee,
otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to the compensation, terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment, or retaliate against an employee in any fonn
or manner because: (a) perceived to be or is a victim of domestic or sexual violence;
(b) with the exception of the batterer, perpetrator or abuser, has participated in legal
proceedings related to an incident of domestic or sexual violence of which the
employee or a family or household member was a victim; or (c) if the workplace is
disrupted or threatened by the action of a person whom the employee states has
committed or threatened to commit domestic or sexual violence against the employee
or the employee's family or household member.

534

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 18, 2006

E.

F.

2.

For purposes of this section, discrimination, with respect to the terms, conditions, or
privileges of employment, includes the failure to make a reasonable accommodation, of
an otherwise qualified individual, absent undue hardship, to the known limitations
resulting from circumstances relating to being a survivor/victim of domestic or sexual
violence or having a family or household member who is the victim of domestic or
sexual violence.

3.

Reasonable accommodation may include leave options, adjustment to work schedules,
additional security at the workplace, or workplace relocation if operations permit. In
determining whether a reasonable accommodation would impose an undue hardship,
factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, the nature and cost of the
reasonable accommodation required, the overall financial resources of the facility
involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation and the impact to the
operation of the department.

Disciplinary Procedures for Employees Who Commit Acts or Threats of Domestic or
Sexual Violence
1.

Cook County is committed to providing a workplace in which the perpetration of
domestic or sexual violence is neither tolerated nor excused. Any physical assault or
threat made by an employee while on Cook County premises, during working hours, or
at a Cook County sponsored event is a serious violation of Cook County policy. This
policy applies not only to acts against other employees, but to acts against all other
persons. Employees found to have violated this policy will be subject to corrective or
disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

2.

Employees who are convicted of a crime of domestic or sexual violence may be subject
to corrective or disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, when such action
affects the work performance of the employee, affects normal operations of Cook
County, or otherwise implicates County rules.

Guidelines and Plan for Implementation
The Cook County Bureau of Human Resources is charged with the development of
guidelines, training programs and written educational materials consistent with the goals of
this policy. These guidelines and other material shall be used to assist individual County
departments and offices in implementation of this policy. In implementation of this policy,
each County department and office shall have the flexibility to address its individual needs
and concerns provided they comply with VESSA. All County department heads and
employees shall render such aid and assistance as is required for implementation of this
policy.

Who can find a Virtuous woman? For her price is above rubies. The heart of her husband doth
safety trust in her, so that he shall no need to spoil. She will do him good and not evil all the days
of her life. She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. She is like the
merchants ships; that bring her food from afar. She riseth also while it is yet night, and give meat
to her household, and a portion to her maidens. She considereth a flied and buyeth it with the fruit
of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth her lions with strength, and strengthens her arms.
She perceives that her merchandise is good; her candle goeth not out by night. She poor; yea she
reaches forth her hand to the needy. She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her
household is clothed with searlet. She maketh herself covering of tapestry; her clothing is silk and
purple. Proverbs 31; 10-22; and

REFLECTION OF CHARLES H. SHAW
WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called Charles H. Shaw from our midst; and
WHEREAS, from glittering high-rises along Chicago's lakefront to the revitalization of one of its poorest
neighborhoods, real estate developer Charles H. Shaw took risks and made a lasting mark on Chicago;
and
WHEREAS, "Stabilizing the inner cities is critical to continuing the way of life we've known," he said in
a 1994 Tribune interview. "The broader society is more and more beginning to recognize that our
destinies are interwoven and we'd better do something"; and
WHEREAS, his imprint on the city stretched from 1968, with the controversial construction of Lake
Point Tower adjacent to Navy Pier, through the massive renovation of the Chicago Hilton and Towers in
1984, to the ongoing renovation of Homan Square in the North Lawndale neighborhood; and

541

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 18, 2006

WHEREAS, former Sears CEO Edward Brennan recruited Mr. Shaw in 1988 to help redevelop Homan
Square, the company's 57-acre property that had sat vacant for years in the middle of the beleaguered
North Lawndale neighborhood. "I knew that Charlie was a real estate expert, but with a little different
vision than most," recalled Brennan. "It was a turning point in Charlie's career. It was a point where he
was going to pull back from doing things in his own business to devoting more time to not-for-profit"
endeavors"; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Shaw agreed to collaborate on the project, though he warned Brennan the development,
which eventually would include several hundred residences, 1 million square feet of commercial space
and a $30 million community center, would be difficult and would take years. Over time, it has gained
national recognition as a model of urban revitalization; and
WHEREAS, he said it was his obligation, and the obligation of the development community in general,
to invigorate urban neighborhoods; and
WHEREAS, Chairman of the Shaw Co., the developer began his career in an earlier partnership with Bill
Hartnett. Their fledgling development company directed the construction of the two buildings that
completed the United Nations Plaza in New York. That success, in turn, led to an opportunity to build
what would become Lake Point Tower, now one of the most distinctive buildings on the city's lakefront.
From its beginning, though, the development stirred public controversy over whether its massiveness was
appropriate for its location; and
WHEREAS, besides Lake Point Tower, Mr. Shaw oversaw dozens of other developments, including the
44-story Museum Tower condominiums erected over the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Other
projects included the Luther Village retirement community in Arlington Heights and the Northwestern
University/Evanston Research Park; and
WHEREAS, "Charles Shaw was a very public-spirited developer who cared about more than simply
making money," he said in a statement. "In partnership with city government, he invested in
neighborhoods that needed new development and gave working families the opportunity to obtain
affordable housing. Chicago is a better city because of him"; and
WHEREAS, "Homan Square, though it isn't finished, was a capstone for so many of the other things he
did," Brennan said. "He knew there was still a lot more to do"; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Shaw, 72, of Winnetka, Illinois died Wednesday while visiting Snowmass, Colorado.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Members of the Board of
Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby extend our
sincerest deepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathy to the family and many friends of Charles H.
Shaw on his outstanding accomplishments and professional commitment which has been demonstrated in
the development industry; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of same be tendered to the family of Mr.
Charles H. Shaw so that his memory may be so honored and ever cherished.
