PROJECTS
St. Charles School Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg represented the St. Charles School Brownfield Redevelopment Plan (the
“Plan”). Mr. Vosburg noted that due to negotiations that concluded earlier in the day with
the Detroit Land Bank Authority regarding 3 of the 5 parcels that are part of the Plan, an
updated Plan was handed out to the Board. The negotiations resulted in relatively minor
changes to the Brownfield TIF figures which are reflected in the newest Plan.
Project Introduction
FSI 4, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which entails the
rehabilitation of the vacant former St. Charles School, which is next door to St. Charles

 Borromeo Catholic Church, into a 27-unit loft-style rental building which will include a new
construction fourth floor. A new construction 11-unit two-story townhome building will be
built directly to the south of the school building on what are four vacant lots. One, two
and three bedroom units will be created, with 8 of the 11 new construction townhomes
reserved as affordable units for renters with incomes below 80% of the area median
income (AMI). The parking areas of the development will be located away from the street
view and have green storm water features.
Approximately 5 permanent full time equivalent jobs and 100 temporary construction jobs
are expected to be created as a result of the project. The total investment is estimated
to exceed $8.3 million. The Developer is requesting $851,295 in TIF reimbursement.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) is located at 1432-1454 Townsend Street, five
parcels on the eastside of Townsend Street between St. Paul and Agnes Streets in the
Islandview Village neighborhood of Detroit, just east of East Grand Boulevard and just
north of East Jefferson Avenue near Belle Isle.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized for a commercial and/or residential purpose; (b) it
is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and
(c) the Property is determined to be functionally obsolete, blighted and/or adjacent to or
contiguous to an eligible parcel and is estimated to increase the captured taxable value
of that property as defined by Act 381. 1454 Townsend, the former school building, has
been certified functionally obsolete by a level 3 or level 4 assessor, a letter to that effect
can be found in Attachment D of the Plan. The three vacant lots identified as 1432, 1438
and 1444 Townsend are owned by the Detroit Land Bank Authority and thus automatically
qualify as blighted per Act 381, the initial determination of blight letter is pending from
Detroit City Planning Commission staff. The parcel identified as 1450 Townsend is
adjacent and contiguous to eligible parcels at 1444 and 1454 Townsend Street.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, infrastructure
improvements, site preparation, and development and preparation of a brownfield plan
and/or work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the
development of the Property and will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority
is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The eligible
activities are estimated to begin in fall/winter of 2016 and complete within eighteen (18)
months.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse

 the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.
