Scope of Work Summary
Public Works is submitting the final amended agreement (Subsidiary No. 1) to Contract CE1800212 with
Becdir Construction Co., Inc. for the rehabilitation of West 41st Street Bridge No. 01.05 over Norfolk
Southern Railroad and Train Avenue in the City of Cleveland for an increased amount not-to-exceed
$77,927.40.
Is recommending to accept construction as complete and in accordance with plans and specifications;
requesting authority for the County Treasurer to release the escrow account, in accordance with Ohio
Revised Code Section 153.63.
A Notice to Proceed was given September 24, 2018 and all physical work was completed by May 31,
2019. The plan quantity adjustments were based on final field measurements and calculations. The
new items of work were due to errors in the plans, additional costs were incurred to establish
benchmark and elevations. The additional work to the bearing plates and shims was performed so the
intended work would comply to plans and specifications. The new strip seal needed to be changed to
work with the existing expansion joint, which was different then what the plan had noted. Additional
work was also performed because of deteriorated steel conditions in the channel section. Additional
costs were incurred due to the changes in the M.O.T for the City of Cleveland’s Clark Road Project and
planned detour route at the beginning of the project at the request from the City of Cleveland.
Additional costs were also incurred to accelerate the work on the project to open the bridge to traffic
due to it being used for the City of Cleveland’s Fulton Road Project planned detour route. Due to the
askew of the structure at the abutment and at the piers the cross frames interfered with the installation
of the anchor bolts. To install the anchor bolts the existing cross frames had to be removed and then
were reinstalled. New protective coating was placed on the steel and welds at the removal areas.
The engineer’s estimate was $850,000.00. The final cost is $760,304.46 (10% under).
The project is located in Council District 3.
