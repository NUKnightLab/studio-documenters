one for services to families of victims of homicide or murder and the other for training of
law enforcement personnel. She said staff was recommending designations for law
enforcement training. She said the notice of funding opportunity generated 10 responses
from qualified applicants and that the following agencies received the highest scores in
the merit-based review process. She also noted estimated the costs of each entity’s DPArelated training needs over the next 36 months.

Ms. Brennan explained the programs’ periods of performance would end June 30, 2019.
Mr. Stevens said DPA funds are appropriated to ICJIA from a trust and that
appropriations to ICJIA would be made annually until the fund is depleted. Unlike other
funding sources, there is no money going into the DPA trust fund, he said.
Mr. Stevens, in response to a question from Ms. Wolff, said the effectiveness of the law
enforcement training would be assessed with pre-and post-tests.
Motion: Mr. Olson moved to approve the recommended SFY19 DPA designations. Ms.
Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
3. Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)

to his involvement with the Cook County Public Defender’s Office and a recusal by Ms.
Kramer for her involvement with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.
C. Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program
Mr. Stevens said that the Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program supports a
team of researchers that identify priority criminal justice issues for the state, conduct
research and analysis on these areas, and disseminate information to guide decisionmaking locally and within ICJIA. He said staff recommended designating $424,053 in
FFY17 JAG funds to continue supporting the program for a period of approximately five
months after the program’s current grant expires. The funds would support the program
through roughly February 2020, he said.
Motion: Mr. Kocerka moved to approve the recommended FFY17 designation. Ms.
Kramer seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
4. Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Plan Adjustments
ICJIA Program Supervisor Ron Reichgelt introduced the FFY16, FFY17, and FFY18

*Matching funds requirement has been waived for this 18-month continuation.

Mr. Reichgelt said the designations would be the second of two 18-month grants given to
the programs, completing the 36 months of funding allowed under the original notice of
funding opportunity. He noted East Aurora School District (EASD) was granted a
matching funds waiver by the federal Office for Victims of Crime.
Dr, Alderden added ICJIA received a $750,000 grant to augment its InfoNet system that
would allow it to track outcome data and reinforce case-planning for these and other
VOCA programs.
Motion: Mr. Olson moved to approve the recommended FFY18 VOCA designations.
Ms. Wolff seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
B. Lead Entities
Mr. Reichgelt explained ICJIA partners with three lead entity agencies: Illinois Coalition
Against Domestic Violence (ICADV), Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault
(ICASA), and Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois (CACI). He said ICJIA awards
each one a substantial grant they then redistribute as sub-grants to member agencies via a
competitive process. He said staff recommended designating FFY17 VOCA funds to the
lead entities as described in the table below:

Mr. Reichgelt said staff recommended designating to each agency another $1.9 million in
FFY16 funds to be distributed among their partner agencies to purchase/upgrade
computers and other office equipment. He said the designations would be an effective use
of remaining unexpended FFY16 funds, which were set to expire on September 30.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended FFY16 and FFY17 VOCA
designations. Mr. Kocerka seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
C. Trauma Recovery Center Program
Mr. Reichgelt said the Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) Program was modeled after a
TRC program in San Francisco, Calif. The notice of funding opportunity for this program
required applicants to closely follow the San Francisco TRC model for funding
eligibility, he said, adding that just two of more than 10 applications received sufficiently
complied with the model. He said the recommended continuation grant designations
described in the table would support an additional 12 months of program activity, funding
both programs through 30 of the full 36 months allowed under the original funding
opportunity. He said the designations would support ongoing personnel costs, client
emergency funds, local staff travel, TRC rent, indirect costs, and computer licenses. He
noted the programs have proven to be very successful.

RE:

FFY19 Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grant Program
Introduction

NFSIA FFY19 Introduction
ICJIA’s application for Federal Fiscal Year 2019 (FFY19) Paul Coverdell Forensic Science
Improvement Grant Program (NFSIA) was submitted on June 6, 2019. Funds are expected to be
released January 1, 2020. ICJIA requested $690,337 in its application.
The NFSIA grant program awards grants to states and units of local government to improve
forensic science and medical examiner/coroner services. The funds may be used to eliminate a
backlog in the analysis of forensic evidence, and to train and employ forensic laboratory
personnel and medicolegal death investigators, as needed, to eliminate such a backlog.
Notice of Funding Opportunity Recommendation
As required by the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act, ICJIA plans to issue a
competitive notice of funding Opportunity (NOFO) to state and local accredited laboratories
carry out all or a substantial part of a program intended to improve the quality and timeliness of
forensic science or medical examiner services in the State.
Staff requests designating about $624,535.00 in anticipated SFY19 NFSIA funds to issue a
competitive NOFO in the third quarter of 2019. This amount may change upon notification of the
actual award. Designation recommendations resulting from this funding opportunity will be
presented at the December 12, 2019, Budget Committee meeting.

RE:

FFY18 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Notice of Funding
Opportunity

RSAT FFY18 INTRODUCTION
The Grant Accountability and Transparency Act requires grants to be initiated through a
competitive process unless an adequate justification is presented for sole source funding in a
particular case. To comply with this requirement, ICJIA will issue a FFY18 Residential
Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) in the 3rd quarter
of 2019 to solicit applications for state and local correctional treatment and aftercare services.
The notice will detail federal RSAT requirements and model RSAT programs and best practices.
RSAT assists state and local governments in the development and implementation of substance
use disorder treatment programs in state and local correctional and detention facilities. Funds
also are available to create and maintain community-based aftercare services for individuals after
release from incarceration.
Notice of Funding Opportunity Recommendation
ICJIA plans to issue a competitive NOFO to state and local correctional and detention facilities
to increase and/or expand evidence-based substance use disorder treatment access to individuals
with substance use disorders in jail or prison, thereby reducing risk of overdose and death.
Staff requests a designation of $700,000 in available FFY18 RSAT funds to issue a competitive
NOFO in the third quarter of 2019. Designation recommendations resulting from this funding
opportunity will be presented at the December 12, 2019, Budget Committee meeting.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

RE:

State Program Appropriations:
SFY20 Safer Foundation
SFY20 Street Intervention Program / Metropolitan Family Services
SFY20 Violence Prevention and Street Intervention Programming
SFY20 Community-Based Violence Prevention and Intervention
SFY20 Community Law Enforcement Partnership for Deflection & Substance
Use Disorders
SFY20 Safe From the Start
SFY20 City of Danville Violence Prevention
SFY20 Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils
SFY20 Death Penalty Abolition Fund

This memo describes proposed designations for programs referenced above.
A. SFY20 Safer Foundation
Safer Foundation provides employment opportunities for individuals who are at risk of engaging in
unlawful activities, have already experienced justice system involvement, becoming victims and/or
perpetrators of violence, or falling into the ranks of the unemployed. In collaboration with its
community partners, employer partners, and training partners, Safer will recruit, screen, and prepare
program participants for sustainable employment. Job placement strategies will include transitional jobs,
on-the-job training, and permanent placements. ICJIA funds will allow Safer Foundation to use
mechanisms to provide additional supports to clients participating in a higher level of credentialed
training and job training, including higher literacy, skill level, case management, and wrap around
services. Job training and placement is anticipated to occur in one of these fields: auto mechanics, food
service/culinary arts, carpentry and /or electrical trades, automotive mechanics, construction, and media.

In addition, Safer will partner with Mount Sinai Hospital’s Sinai Urban Health Institute as it seeks to
better understand the issues connected to gun violence in Chicago’s west side communities. Safer will
partner with Alliance of Local Service Organizations, and Safer Demand Skills Collaborative skills
training partners to deliver a holistic workforce and human capital development program.
Staff recommends designating $1,000,000 in SFY20 funds to Safer Foundation to support their
employment programs to provide interpersonal skills, competencies, and tools to overcome barriers to
employment for young adults who are justice-involved, at risk of becoming just involved, experiencing
violence, and/or at risk for experiencing violence. Further details are provided in the attached Grant
Recommendation Form.
B. SFY20 Street Intervention Program / Metropolitan Family Services
In 2016, in response to the gun violence in Chicago, Metropolitan Family Services (MFS) leadership was
part of a citywide task group of high level public officials, criminal justice stakeholders, private funders,
leading social service agencies, and community-based agencies leading city efforts in conducting violence
intervention work in Chicago. This group worked to strategize a response to the increasing high levels of
gun violence in Chicago. The resulting framework, Communities Partnering 4 Peace (CP4P), focused on a
community-driven model that was built upon research and best practices that could be adapted based on the
identifying needs, community-assets, and strategic partnerships that are uniquely Chicago. As the
coordinating body of CP4P, MFS is responsible for managing, funding, and monitoring sub-award grantees
who are implementing intervention strategies under the CP4P model.
The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) will grant MFS funds to provide sub-awards to
agencies for outreach services, to mediate and intervene with conflicts, and provide other supports to reduce
the shooting and homicide incidents in high need communities.
For the first six months of services (July 1, 209 – December 31, 2019), MFS will execute sub-grants to
continue the CeaseFire model in communities that received funds in FY19, administered by the University
of Illinois at Chicago. This will prevent service interruption during the critical summer months, which is
when peak periods of violence occur. It will also allow MFS to release a competitive Notice of Funding
Opportunity for the CP4P program model, to be implemented during the remaining months of the fiscal year
(January 1, 2020 – June 30, 2020). Funds will be prioritized for communities with greatest need based on
the number of shootings and number of homicides.
Staff recommends designating $5,984,870 in SFY20 funds to Metropolitan Family Services to support
Street Intervention Programs/CP4P. Further details are provided in the attached Grant Recommendation
Form.
C. Violence Prevention and Street Intervention Programming
Details will be provided in a forthcoming supplemental memorandum.

D. SFY20 Community-Based Violence Intervention and Prevention
The Community-Based Violence Prevention and Intervention (CB-VIP) program is in its second year.
The program targets youth and young adults, including, but not limited to, those who are identified as
being at heightened risk or those who engage in high-risk behavior or violence. Funded programs must,
at a minimum, provide the following:





Convene or expand an existing community coalition to engage service providers, governmental
agencies (local and/or statewide agencies), law enforcement, faith-based, and general community
members. The purpose of the coalition is to ensure that service providers and all potential
participants are aware of violence prevention resources available in community; to develop
collaborative partnerships to ensure that client’s immediate needs are met; and to provide prosocial activities for the community.
Educate public about program services through wide distribution and various types of program
materials, public presentations, and awareness events.
Implementation of at least one of the following direct service categories (additional points will be
given for applications that reflect more than one category):
o Street Intervention/Interruption-Active Outreach and Engagement – Programs that target atrisk youth and young adults to provide crisis intervention and de-escalation of high stress
situations. Examples of promising programs include Richmond Comprehensive Homicide
Initiative, CureViolence, Operation Ceasefire, and Safe Streets.
o Counseling and Therapy - Developmentally and culturally appropriate therapeutic services
provided by a mental health professional. Effective programs incorporate cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT) and/or include contingency management approaches. These programs are often
individual or family-based, such as Multisystemic Therapy, Functional Family Therapy,
Multidimensional Family Therapy, Aggression Replacement Training, Assisted Outpatient
Treatment, and Coping Power Program, CBT for Trauma in Schools, and Good Behavior
Game.
o Case Management - Supporting youth and their families in identifying and accessing resources.
Individuals at risk for involvement in street-level violence can be difficult to engage in
services. Case management approaches that actively engage youth and families (i.e., active
reaching out, meeting youth/families in the home, community engagement) are more effective
at long-term client retention and developing trust than more passive case management
approaches, such as requiring youth/families to meet in office locations.
o Youth Development - Engaging young people to develop their emotional, physical, social and
intellectual selves. Program provides opportunities for youth to practice conflict resolution and
prosocial life skills.

Staff recommends designating a maximum of $7,691,850 in SFY20 funds to support the CBVIP
program. If an appropriation is different from the anticipated amount, designations will be pro-rated
accordingly and ICJIA staff will inform the Budget Committee of the adjusted amounts. Further details
are provided in the attached Grant Recommendation Form.

drug overdose incidences and death, reduce criminal offending and recidivism, and help prevent arrest
and conviction records from destabilizing health, families, and opportunities from community,
citizenship, and self-sufficiency.

response to family violence in communities. Annually, thousands of professionals from across Illinois
participate in council trainings and projects. These include family violence training and education of
criminal justice and community professionals; development of criminal justice procedures, protocols,
and services related to family violence; and the facilitation of coordinated community response to family
violence in local areas. Local councils provide opportunities for communication between criminal
justice professionals and community service providers and encourage information sharing and resources
to develop a network of safety and assistance for family violence victims.
Funds are used to support a part-time local council coordinator for each council and coordination of
committee work, training, travel, and other related activities as determined by the local council
planning/steering committees. The planning/steering committee and local council coordinator establish
the goals and objectives for the upcoming year. All local council activities are approved by the IFVCC.

Program Description
Safer Foundation has a record of effectively combatting recidivism and crime reduction by providing
employment opportunities to individuals who are at risk of engaging in unlawful activities, becoming the
victims and/or perpetrators of violence, or falling into the ranks of the long-term unemployed. Safer Foundation
has a robust network of resources to support workforce and human capital development leading to employment
and economic stability for people with arrest and conviction records. In collaboration with its community,
employer, and training partners, Safer will recruit, screen, and prepare program participants for sustainable
employment. Job placement strategies will include transitional jobs, on-the-job training, and permanent
placements.
The Working 4 Peace program incorporates “earn and learn” educational strategies and credential skills training
to prepare young adults (primarily 18-26 years of age) experiencing or at risk for violence and those with
criminal records for careers. The goal is to position participants with the interpersonal skills, competencies, and
tools to overcome barriers to employment. Clients participating in this higher level of credentialed and job
training are prepared for anticipated placement in auto mechanics, food service/culinary arts, carpentry and /or
electrical trades, automotive mechanics, construction, or media.
In addition, Safer will partner with Mount Sinai Hospital’s Sinai Urban Health Institute (SUHI) as it seeks to
better understand the issues connected to gun violence in Chicago’s west side communities. The rippling effect
of gun violence has both social and economic impacts including lost wages and taxes, medical bills, high law
enforcement and corrections costs, and community disinvestment. Safer Foundation and key partners: Sinai
Urban Health Institute, ALSO-Chicago (Alliance of Local Service Organizations), and Safer Demand Skills
Collaborative (SDSC) skills training partners will deliver a holistic workforce and human capital development
program. As a referral partner, SUHI seeks to work with Safer to build their previous study of non-fatal gun
violence victims who are treated and discharged quickly. The goal is to refer such persons for Safer services and
to identify their social needs, gaps, resources and barriers to employment and workforce development
comparing those with and those without arrest/conviction records. This partnership leverages the expertise of
both organizations and employs new strategies in addressing violence reduction. This program element would
provide needed staffing to conduct assessments of non-fatal gun violence victims with superficial injuries in the
emergency department and to link those with arrest or conviction records to Safer workforce development
services in high demand/skill areas. This program is structured around coordinated partners who are focused on
changing the trajectory of life outcomes for participants. Core elements utilize operational excellence, fidelity to
proven practices. Moreover, this program will empower participants to make positive life choices, support

Note: During the preparation of this document, the grantee anticipated serving the same number of clients in
FY20 as in FY19. The reason for not increasing the numbers was that SFY19 programming reflected greater
concentration of services than is normally provided. The plan for FY20 was to go back to their normal service
provision process. However, we anticipate a revised Budget Committee Recommendation Report will be
provided at the meeting to that reflects the actual appropriated amount of $1,000,000.

Agency Budget:

Line Item Appropriation

Program Description
In 2016, in response to the gun violence in Chicago, Metropolitan Family Services (MFS) leadership was part
of a citywide task group of high level public officials, criminal justice stakeholders, private funders, leading
social service agencies, and community-based agencies leading city efforts in conducting violence intervention
work in Chicago. This group worked to strategize a response to the increasing high levels of gun violence in
Chicago. The resulting framework, Communities Partnering 4 Peace (CP4P), focuses on a community-driven
model that was built upon research and best-practices that could be adapted based on the identifying needs,
community-assets, and strategic partnerships that are uniquely Chicago. As the coordinating body of CP4P,
MFS is responsible for managing, funding, and monitoring sub-award grantees who are implementing
intervention strategies under the CP4P model. This appropriation will provide sub-awards to agencies for
outreach services, mediate and intervene with conflicts, and provide other supports to reduce the shooting and
homicide incidents in high need communities.
For the first six months of services (July 1, 209 – December 31, 2019), MFS will execute sub-grants to continue
the CeaseFire model in communities that received funds administered by the University of Illinois at Chicago in
SFY19. This will prevent service interruption during the critical summer months, which is when peak periods of
violence occur. During this time MFS will release a competitive notice of funding opportunity for the CP4P
program model, with planned program implementation during the remaining months of the fiscal year (January
1, 2020, to June 30, 2020). Funds will be prioritized for the highest need communities in the state based on the
number of shootings and number of homicides.
CP4P provides a targeted and holistic multi-tiered approach to confront gun violence in the highest risk
neighborhoods of Chicago, implementing multiple interventions that work directly with both perpetrators and
the victims of gun violence. This comprehensive response collaborates with local agencies who are skilled in
peace, trauma, victim services, wraparound supports and have capable outreach workers who live and work
within these communities. The partner agencies of CP4P are fully integrated within their neighborhoods
allowing them to establish authentic relationships within their communities so they can be responsive to
incidences of gun violence, and to the needs of victims impacted by this violence.

Program Activities
Street Intervention
This work revolves around the efforts of hospital responders, violence interrupters, case managers and outreach
workers who are professionally-trained and streetwise individuals who are familiar with street violence in the
communities where community partners are active. Hospital responders (at local trauma centers) and violence
interrupters (on the streets) interact with individuals involved in violence at critical moments to prevent
retaliations and influence behavior change. Both roles coordinate referrals to case management staff, case
managers in the hospital setting, and outreach workers in the community setting. Case managers and outreach
workers help with on-the-spot problem solving and exploring nonviolent means to address problems while
simultaneously connecting participants with resources and supports (employment, continued education, social
service, healthcare or housing resources, etc.). In addition to work focused on individuals, staff also conduct
group level events, such as focus groups and peace summits. Focus groups are small events that provide
opportunities for participants from a range of communities to have deeper conversations about issues connected
with violence while peace summits are larger events in which the planning stage is the main force for
community-level behavior change
CP4P
Community Mobilization – Grantees must hire and support a program manager who will work a minimum of 50
percent on the Partnership for a Safer Chicago program, to broaden and strengthen community relationships.
Public Education – Grantees must distribute public education materials within the community to provide
information and resources on the following: community resources, positive alternatives to violence,
consequences of violent behavior, and laws pertaining to violent crimes. Subcontractors are required to use
MFS-approved Partnership for a Safer Chicago messaging. All public education material must be pre-approved
prior to implementation.
Outreach – Grantees must hire and support a minimum of three outreach workers, plus a lead worker or field
supervisor, to mediate and intervene with conflicts and provide other support to individuals who, because of
their backgrounds and present situations, are involved in or likely become involved in shootings.
In addition, MFS CP4P coordinates a cross-agency effort that brings together community-based organizations to
deliver a comprehensive community outreach and engagement infrastructure in the highest risk communities.
Each partner agency is recognized as a Neighborhood Safety Team and delivers the following components:
1. Deliver ongoing street outreach services to high risk individuals and situations.
2. Deliver proactive, prevention services to individuals who are not currently at imminent risk, considered high
risk.
3. Deliver re-entry services to individuals going through re-entry – including family and community
reunification support.
4. Deliver Summer Safety Strategy in Safe Spaces for Light in the Nights.
5. Implementation of the Metro Peace Academy: The training academy:
a. Provides ongoing professional development of outreach workers to promote best practices
b. Ensures consistent standards in how outreach workers deliver services

c. Establishes a city-wide network of outreach workers to ensure the highest probability of success in
achieving the dual goal of cross city/multi-neighborhood outreach work and professionalization of
street outreach
Goals
Goal 1: Reduce the number of shootings and homicides in targeted areas by 10 percent compared to SFY19.


Reduce the number of shootings in targeted areas by engaging highest-risk individuals to interrupt and
change violent behavior compared to FY2019 and the three-year average for shootings in the target area
during timeframes when community-based sites are up and running. Chicago Police Department’s City
Portal website will be accessed to monitor shooting data in Chicago.



Reduce the number of homicides in targeted areas by engaging highest-risk individuals to interrupt and
change violent behavior compared to FY2019 and the three-year average for homicides in the target area
during timeframes when community-based sites are up and running. Chicago Police Department’s City
Portal website will be accessed to monitor homicide data in Chicago.



Decrease the number of shootings and homicides within a 1 block radius of Light in the Night event
locations by 10 percent as compared to FY2019 for the time period of July 1st through September 30th
.and, separately, for the entire year compared to FY2019. (This goal is for the CP4P program.) 

Goal 2: Change group and community norms associated with violent behavior as measured by conflicts
between factions in the communities served and by increases in prosocial behavior in the areas of: health,
education, employment, community engagement, social support, and feelings of neighborhood safety. 
Goal 3: Increase by 10 percent the number of average direct service hours received and connections to services
for each participant served by Street Intervention and CP4P. (This goal is for the CP4P program.) 
CP4P’s collaboration identifies individuals at the highest risk of being perpetrators or victims of violence by
building authentic and trusting relationships within communities. CP4P aims to reach and connect them to
resources provided by community-based organizations participating in the CP4P collaboration. CP4P values
include a hyperlocal approach to service delivery, trauma-informed interventions, nonviolence, and restorative
justice practices.
Priorities
In 2012, ICJIA’s enabling statute was expanded to include additional responsibilities related to violence
prevention. These responsibilities include distributing grants to community and statewide organizations, other
units of local and state government, and public-school districts that address violence prevention in a
comprehensive and collaborative manner. The program described in this recommendation will provide subawards to agencies for outreach services, to mediate and intervene with conflicts, and provide other supports to
reduce the shooting and homicide incidents in high need communities.

Program Description
Community violence includes a wide range of crimes, such as murder, gun violence, interpersonal and domestic
violence, sexual violence, robbery, and aggravated or simple assault and battery. Violence is important to
address because experiencing or witnessing this type of violence can increase fear and distrust among
community members, and often leads to a feeling that communities are unsafe. It can also result in posttraumatic stress disorder and other short- and long-term negative outcomes for individuals and communities.
Each Community-Based Violence Intervention and Prevention grantee must:





Convene or expand an existing community coalition to engage service providers, governmental
agencies (local and/or statewide agencies), law enforcement, faith-based, and general community
members to ensure that service providers and all potential participants are aware of violence
prevention resources available in community; develop collaborative partnerships to ensure that
clients’ immediate needs are met; and provide pro-social activities for the community.
Educate the public about program services through wide distribution and various types of program
materials, public presentations and awareness events.
Provide at least one of the four following direct services:
o Street Intervention/Interruption-Active Outreach and Engagement – These programs provide
crisis intervention and de-escalation of high stress situations to at-risk youth and young
adults.
o Counseling and Therapy – These developmentally and culturally appropriate therapeutic
services are provided by a mental health professional.
o Case Management – Case management approaches that are more effective at long-term client
retention and developing trust between agency and youth/families require actively engaging
participants (i.e., active reaching out, meeting youth/families in the home, community
engagement).
o Youth Development – Engaging young people to develop their emotional, physical, social,
and intellectual selves provides opportunities for youth to practice conflict resolution and
prosocial life skills.

Bright Star Community

$690,921.00
Bright Star will provide case management through the Truancy Education and Mentoring (TEAM) program,
which serves youth ages 13 to 18 that are chronically truant, suspended, or expelled from school, or are at
especially high risk for violent behavior or victimization. TEAM provides a safe, productive environment for
youth to receive help completing assignments missed during their suspensions and counseling services aimed
at addressing issues that resulted in suspension or expulsion. TEAM is intended to improve student attendance,
increase academic performance, strengthen families, and reduce truancy. Counseling will also be provided to
high-risk and justice-involved youth. The GREAT Schools and Families program was developed for middle
school youth and their families to decrease violence by promoting youth academic and social competence and
improve parental skills, support, and involvement with the schools. The program includes 16 sessions and is
delivered through multiple family groups (4-6 families per group). The intervention was found to have positive
effects for participating youth and families, and a positive ecological effect on school-level aggression because
the decreasing aggressive behavior among youth participating in the program had an impact on the behavior of
other students in the same grade. Multisystemic therapy (MST) is offered to youth ages 12-17 who exhibit
criminal and non-criminal violent, delinquent, and antisocial behaviors. MST provides services, delivered by
therapists to youth and their families to restructure the home, school, and community environments. The aim
of MST is to decrease problem youth behaviors and promote the development and utilization of productive and
prosocial youth behaviors. Randomized controlled trial results show MST reduces short- and long-term
criminal behaviors and out-of-home placements for serious juvenile offenders.
The target population is chronically truant, suspended, or expelled youth in middle and high school and their
families.

involvement, youth who are disconnected from school and work, and youth who are coping with symptoms of
trauma. This program will provide trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy to help them manage their
symptoms of trauma and pro-social learning to help them fully participate in school and out of school
activities. They also need help resolving crises and persistent support to engage with school, so this program

Heartland Alliance will implement a program that offers street outreach and engagement, transitional jobs, and
cognitive behavior therapy program targeting young adults at highest risk of being victims or perpetrators of
gun violence. Participants will meet with coaches for employment and life coaching, family/child relationship
support, education goal setting, job search assistance, and to identify and address ongoing needs and
challenges. Once engaged, participants can receive up to two years of intensive CBT and other supportive
services - including 18 months in a subsidized transitional job – plus six months of follow-up support to
promote more lasting pro-social behavior, attachment to the workforce, and access to opportunity. Continued
support is critical to sustaining behavior changes, offering support during difficult experiences, and helping
participants transition and stabilize in unsubsidized employment. Additional group sessions will focus on
career pathing, parenting, asset building, and conflict management, among others. Lastly, a clinician and a
READI coach or outreach worker will co-facilitate group CBT sessions using the University of Cincinnati’s
CBT-IMT curriculum and Seeking Safety.

Springfield Urban League will apply the Cure Violence model. The model prevents violence through a 3-prong
approach: (1) Interrupt Transmission – early detection of an individual’s potential for violence; (2) Identify
and change the thinking of the highest potential transmitters; and (3) Change the group norms. Violence
Interrupters will implement the following strategies:






Engage high-risk youth and young adults in the public places where they congregate, build a rapport
with them, and recruit them to participate in the program.
Refer participants for case management, youth development, and supportive services.
Identify potential violent incidents.
Facilitate conflict mediation.
Contribute to changing group norms related to violence.

Three types of events will be offered: community block parties, designed to build relationships with the target
population, recruit participants, interrupt violent street activity, substitute peaceful activities for the duration of
the event, and facilitate relationship-building among neighbors who seldom interact due to fear and
resentment; Safe Haven monthly events that occur during late-night hours when violence is most prevalent and
offer an opportunity to meet representatives from social service agencies, gather information about the services
they provide, sign-up for on-site sessions about a variety of topics such as anger management, conflict
resolution, employment, education, and/or substance use; and Peace Summits, where members of rival groups,
emerging gang factions, and gang leaders are invited to focus groups and small group sessions. Outreach
workers will provide case management services to assess the baseline needs and strengths of individuals
referred to the program and engage participants using Motivational Interviewing, an evidence-based, clientcentered counseling style that has been shown to be effective in eliciting behavior change by helping
individuals explore and resolve ambivalence. Outreach workers will also refer participants to supportive
services within the agency and/or at other agencies. Participants in the street intervention program will have
the opportunity to participate in the following youth development activities: Educational (tutoring, homework
assistance, academic enrichment, alternative school, GED preparation); Restorative Justice/Community
Service/Service-Learning projects; Workforce Development (occupational skills training leading to a
credential, workforce readiness classes, job coaching, employment placement); Personal Development
(financial literacy classes, healthy relationships classes, goal-setting, communication skills, leadership skills,

consists of six components: 1) time commitment; 2) pro-social behavior; 3) communicating effectively; 4)
conflict resolution 5) family engagement; and 6) job training. Mentors will also help their mentees practice
impulse control and emotional self-regulation.
The target population is youth and young adults ages 14 to 26 who have a history of violent behavior,
substance abuse, and/or gang involvement.

service may vary depending upon the youths’ individual characteristics. When feasible, group services will be
offered and may focus on shared learning with TF-CBT, psychoeducation on their mental health needs, and
prosocial skill development. Case management services will meet youth where they are, emotionally,
developmentally and physically. After a formal assessment, a youth-driven case plan will be developed that
identify goals and action steps related to education, employment, housing and justice system involvement. These
action steps are assigned to the youth, case manager, or youth’s support system (family, friends, teachers,
mentors, etc.). Additional goals may include record expungement, accessing medical resources, obtaining
identification, finding child-care and building family connections.
The target population is youth and young adults ages 14 to 26 who are involved in the juvenile justice system.

South Shore Drill Team will provide twice-weekly performing arts training, a core curriculum of discussion
groups and special speakers, and counseling. South Shore Drill Team instructors help young people direct their
ambition towards developing short-term and long-term goals for performing and beyond. The core curriculum
includes empirically-tested elements (communication skills, actively listening, decision making) and traditional
team discussion topics (teamwork, conflict resolution, goal-setting, self-discipline, self-esteem, and overcoming
adversity.) Team instructors use a repeating 12-month curriculum which is both age-appropriate and genderbased to facilitate discussions at rehearsals and when the group travels. Mentors build on the core curriculum with
additional activities and one-on-one mentoring. If necessary, the community outreach director or social worker
will consult with school authorities at the participant’s school and link youth to tutoring services. Using the Think
First curriculum, participants will receive cognitive behavior therapy to increase self-awareness and increase
social and emotional skills. The counseling sessions should lead to participants having an improved view of
themselves as active agents in personal achievement.
The target population is youth ages 8 to 18 who are at risk for involvement in gangs, drugs, and violence.

* Note on current performance: While this grantee has demonstrated quality services, ICJIA has identified two
issues of note. First, this grantee often does not adhere to established or requested due dates. In addition, the
ICJIA Office of Fiscal Management (OFM) conducted an audit of the program. Because the grantee didn’t submit
the audit questionnaire, ICJIA wasn’t able to confirm grant administration functions and adherence to their
process. However, the audit revealed no instances of misappropriated funds or funds used for purposes outside of
the grant budget. ICJIA will perform another audit during FY20.

Universal Family Connections will provide a variety of services to reduce gang membership and connect at-risk
children, youth, and young adults to positive opportunities. Street-level intervention will incorporate the Boston
Community Centers' Streetworkers Program along with education and supportive services treatment. The Boston
Program provides advocacy for gang members in the courts (when appropriate), helps the probation department
with supervision, mediates disputes and gang truces, and refers gang members and their families to existing
government and community programs.
The program will use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) evidence-based programming and the TraumaFocused Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress (SPARCS) to help reduce
negative emotional and behavioral acts born from experiencing traumatic events and train parents to cope with
the family’s emotional distress and develop skills that support their children utilizing the SPARCS (Structured
Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress) Program. Case management will be provided to
assist individuals to gain access to needed care and services, maintain and preserve independence, and to promote
optimum social, psychological and physical development and functioning. Youth development services will
reduce verbal/physical aggression, fighting, and delinquency though providing trainings and workshops about
bullying, domestic violence, conflict resolution, etc. Youth will also attend monthly
employment/educational/vocational workshops and trainings.
The target population is youth and young adults aged 6 to 24 who have been traumatized by violence in their
homes or community.

Note on current performance: Case management services are lower than anticipated due to two of their subgrantees having issues with participant follow-up. Follow-up appointments have been increasing, but not at the
rate needed to make the projections by the end of Q4. Participants receiving street intervention services have been
hesitant to sign the form documenting service provision. The grantee is working on a way to address the concerns
of these participants so that their service provision can be counted.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Community – Law Enforcement Partnership for Deflection and Substance Use
Disorder Treatment

Program Agency DUNS:

See Designation Chart Below

Funding Source:

Anticipated Appropriation, SFY20: $500,000

Agency Budget:

See Designation Chart Below

Request Type:

Community – Law Enforcement Partnerships: NOFO #1705-572

Program Description
Law enforcement agencies have recognized that overreliance on arrest and subsequent prosecution of low-level
offenders with substance use disorders does not enhance community safety or effectively reduce demand.
Individuals repeatedly cycle through the criminal justice system without adequate treatment and support to
address their disorders. In response, law enforcement agencies have crafted new models to reduce demand by
deflecting individuals with substance use disorders from involvement in the criminal justice to treatment and
services. These models are built on police partnerships with community health and substance use disorder
treatment organizations. The goal of this solicitation is to increase public safety by reducing the significant
social and economic cost of drug misuse by emphasizing the use of treatment over criminal justice involvement.
Program Activities
CLEP provides law enforcement officers critical funding to facilitate connections to community-based
behavioral health interventions that provide substance use treatment, help reduce drug usage, reduce drug
overdose incidences and death, reduce criminal offending and recidivism, and help prevent arrest and
conviction records from destabilizing health, families, and opportunities from community, citizenship, and selfsufficiency.
Goals
The goal for all CLEP Models is to increase public safety and reduce the large social and economic cost of
drugs use through treatment and service referrals. Programs must:







Hire Program Coordinator by the first month of the program.
Develop and adopt protocols for deflection program by second month of the program.
Develop and execute referral and treatment placement MOUs with substance use disorder treatment
providers by second month of the program.
Train officers on the deflection program and substance use disorders by third month of the program.
Train dispatch/911 staff on deflection program and substance use disorders by third month of the
program.
Implement public information initiative(s) by the third month of the program.

Program Description
The Safe from the Start (SFS) grant program is designed to assist in the development, implementation, and
evaluation of comprehensive and coordinated community-based models to identify, assess, and serve children,
ages 0 to 5 who have been exposed to violence in their home and/or community.
Program Activities
Program activities include:
1: Providing assessment, direct services, and evaluation to children and their families who have been
exposed to violence in their home and/or communities.
2: Ensuring social service and community engagement in the SFS program through collaboration and
training.
3: Providing public awareness regarding children exposed to violence via presentations and
community events.
Goals
SFS goals consist of three major components: coalition and collaboration building, direct services, and public
awareness. SFS programs focus on collaborating with state and community agencies to provide individual,
family, and community level supports. SFS is a unique, multi-disciplinary, research-driven, and targeted
intervention that reaches urban, suburban, and rural Illinois families.
Priorities
The financial burden of children’s exposure to violence on other public systems, including child welfare, social
services, law enforcement, juvenile justice, and education is staggering when combined with the loss of
productivity over children’s lifetimes.1 Without intervention, young children exposed to violence are at risk for
cognitive delays and emotional and social difficulties that can lead to additional victimization and later juvenile
justice involvement.

programming. Any future designation recommendations for this program will be pursuant to staff analysis of
program performance and will depend on fund availability.
Past Performance
Matched pre- and post-intervention assessment data from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) show a
significant decrease in symptoms post-SFS intervention. Pre-intervention, 44 percent of SFS child clients scored
in the borderline or clinical range of problem behaviors on the CBCL. Only 28 percent of the children scored in
the borderline or clinical range post-intervention, representing a 36-percent CBCL score improvement.
Following services, the percentage of caregivers scoring at or above the borderline-clinical range on the total
stress subscale of the Parental Stress Inventory (PSI) dropped from 43 percent to 33 percent, representing a 23percent improvement on PSI scores.
As of March 31, 2019, SFS provided a total of 4,989 direct service hours on case management, collaboration,
therapy, crisis intervention, and group services. Numbers of direct services clients are shown in the chart below:

Program Description
The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council comprises 12 local family violence coordinating councils
that offer local forums to share and discuss information promoting a coordinated response to family violence in
communities. Illinois is one of the few states that has a systematically organized, statewide infrastructure that
operates at both the state and local levels. Since the 1970s, a comprehensive, coordinated approach to
preventing family violence has been promoted as the most efficient and effective way to penetrate systems and
mobilize them for the greatest change.
Program Activities
Established in 1993, The councils engage in prevention, education, and the coordination of intervention and
services for victims and perpetrators of domestic abuse, child abuse, teen dating violence, and abuse against
people with disabilities and older adults.
Annually, professionals from across Illinois participate in council trainings and projects. These include family
violence training and education of criminal justice and community professionals; development of criminal
justice procedures, protocols, and services related to family violence; and the facilitation of coordinated
community response to family violence in local areas. Local councils provide opportunities for communication
between criminal justice professionals and community service providers and encourage information sharing and
resources to develop a network of safety and assistance for family violence victims.
Funds are used to support a part-time local council coordinator for each council and coordination of committee
work, training, travel, and other related activities as determined by the local council planning/steering
committees. The planning/steering committee and local council coordinator establish the goals and objectives
for the upcoming year. All local council activities are approved by the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating
Council.
Goals
The purpose of the Family Violence Coordinating Councils, at both the state and local/circuit level, is to
establish a forum to improve the institutional, professional and community response to family violence
including domestic abuse, child abuse, teen dating violence, and abuse against people with disabilities and older

adults; to engage in education and prevention; the coordination of intervention and services for victims and
perpetrators; and to contribute to the improvement of the legal system and the administration of justice.
Priorities
ICJIA prioritizes bringing together key leaders from the justice system and the public to identify critical issues
facing the criminal justice system in Illinois, and proposing and evaluating policies, programs, and legislation
that address those issues. The agency also works to ensure the criminal justice system in Illinois is efficient and
effective.
Funding Prospectus
This designation would support 12 months of funding from state funds, representing Year 1 of a possible three
years of programming. Any future designation recommendations for this program will be pursuant to staff
analysis of program performance and will depend on fund availability.
Past Performance
The numbers of active and funded local councils decreased from 23 to 15 during the state budget impasse. The
program director is working with inactive local councils to reinstate programming for SFY20. The following
table shows performance for SFY19:

violence. Two victims’ advocates will support youth and families in the aftermath of violence, connecting them
to essential services, such as emergency medical care; assistance applying for benefits; childcare, employment,
economic, education and transportation assistance; emergency financial assistance and relocation and housing
advocacy. Community ambassadors also will provide in-field support, including organizing community
wellness and healing activities, such as candlelight vigils and balloon releases, and coordinating peer support
groups for parents who have lost children to community violence. Finally, two community counselors, one
social worker, and one art therapist will provide individual and group therapy, psychoeducational groups, and

RE:

FFY18 Violence Against Women Act Notice of Funding Opportunity

VAWA FFY18 INTRODUCTION
The Grant Accountability and Transparency Act requires grants to be initiated through a
competitive process unless an adequate justification is presented for sole source funding in a
particular case. To comply with this requirement, ICJIA will issue a FFY18 Violence Against
Women Act (VAWA) Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) in the 3rd quarter of 2019 to
solicit applications from culturally specific organizations. Funds will support efforts to develop
and strengthen effective responses to sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and
stalking.
The S.T.O.P. VAWA Formula Grant Program enhances the capacity of local communities to
develop and strengthen effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent
crimes against women and to develop and strengthen victim services in cases involving violent
crimes against women.
The FFY18 VAWA award to Illinois, less the administrative portion, is $4,738,048. The amount
granted will be allocated as follows: 25 percent for law enforcement, 25 percent for prosecutors,
30 percent for victim services (of which at least 10 percent will be distributed to culturally
specific community-based organizations), 5 percent to state and local courts, and the remaining
amount for discretionary purposes. The notice will detail federal VAWA requirements and
purpose areas of the grant.
Notice of Funding Opportunity Recommendation
ICJIA plans to issue a competitive NOFO to organizations that:
• Focus primarily on domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking;
• Has established a specialized culturally specific program that addresses domestic
violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking;
• Has a primary focus on underserved populations;
• Is primarily directed toward racial and ethnic minority groups;
• Is providing services tailored to the unique needs of that population.
75

 VAWA FFY18
June 20, 2019
Page 2 of 2

An organization will qualify to meet this culturally specific set aside for funding if its primary
mission is to address the needs of racial and ethnic minority groups or if it has developed a
special expertise regarding a particular racial and ethnic minority group.
Staff requests a designation of $300,000 in available FFY18 VAWA funds to issue a competitive
NOFO in the third quarter of 2019. Designation recommendations resulting from this funding
opportunity will be presented at the December 12, 2019, Budget Committee meeting.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

FFY18 Violence Against Women Act Plan Introduction

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
The S.T.O.P. Violence Against Women Act Formula Grant Program (VAWA) enhances the capacity of
local communities to develop and strengthen effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies to
combat violent crimes against women and to develop and strengthen victim services in cases involving
violent crimes against women.
VAWA FFY18 INTRODUCTION
The FFY18 VAWA award to Illinois was $5,264,498 and expires June 30, 2020. After setting aside 10
percent of the award for administrative purposes ($526,450), the remaining $4,738,048 available for
program purposes and must be distributed as follows:






25 percent to law enforcement.
25 percent to prosecutors.
30 percent to victim services (of which at least 10 percent must be distributed to culturally
specific community-based organizations).
5 percent to state and local courts.
15 percent to discretionary distribution.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
The designations recommended in this memo are consistent with the priorities set forth in the VAWA
FFY17- FFY20 Multi-Year Implementation Plan.
Historically, ICJIA has designated all of each federal fiscal year’s allocated VAWA funds to the Illinois
Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) and Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA)

in equal amounts. These funds were then subcontracted by them to their program agencies for services
to underserved areas or victim groups.
Staff recommends continuing to designate VAWA funds in this manner, with designations in the
amounts of $710,705 for both ICASA and ICADV.

Program Description
The goal of the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation (CAASE) program is to provide sexual assault
and sex trafficking victims in Cook County with comprehensive legal services, including civil legal services and
victims’ rights representation.
Program Activities
Victim Rights’ Enforcement
A typical sexual assault case for CAASE staff attorneys often begins by seeking a quality investigation from the
Chicago Police Department and Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office and at times requires in-court advocacy
to protect victim’s rights. The specific tasks undertaken by CAASE attorneys for victims’ rights enforcement
include:








Assisting survivors in filing police reports, including requesting officers to meet with survivors at CAASE
offices, where the client may feel more comfortable.
Attending law enforcement and prosecutor interviews and meetings with clients to provide confidential and
privileged legal advice and ensure that their rights as crime victims are respected as they seek to have their
perpetrator charged.
Advocating for additional review of a victims’ case if an investigation is not completed or charges are
denied.
Attending every court date if the perpetrator is criminally charged, to ensure the victim has a voice and
presence throughout the process.
Utilizing the enforcement mechanism in the Crime Victims’ Bill of Rights (also known as Marsy’s Law) to
address and correct violations of victims’ rights for clients during criminal cases against their perpetrators,
through petitions with and arguments to the criminal court.
Advising clients on plea deals offered by prosecutors to defendants.
Assisting clients in completing Victim Impact Statements during the sentencing phase of a criminal case.

Civil Legal Assistance
CAASE representation also involves civil representation simultaneous with or subsequent to criminal justice
engagement in a variety of forums. The laws employed by CAASE attorneys include, but are not limited to, the
Illinois Civil No Contact Order Act (to secure protective orders against rapists); the Illinois Safe Homes Act (to
remedy post-rape housing problems); the Illinois Victim's Employment Safety and Security Act, the Illinois
Human Rights Act, Title VII (to protect employment rights); Title IX, and the Illinois Preventing Sexual
Violence in Higher Education Act (to ensure continued educational access). Survivors of sex trafficking and
prostitution also are served through representation in vacating prostitution-related convictions under the Justice
for Victims of Sex Trafficking Crimes Act.
CAASE has a long history of collaborating with the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) and
local organizations that provide social services to victims of sexual assault. In 2015, CAASE specifically
entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with ICASA and four individual rape crisis centers that serve
victims of sexual assault in the Chicagoland area. These MOUs were designed to ensure rape victims served by
CAASE and the four agencies (Mujeres Latinas en Accion, the YWCA of Metropolitan Chicago, Rape Victim
Advocates, and Northwest CASA) receive comprehensive and collaborative services, including comprehensive
legal representation through CAASE. These agencies have a long history of collaboration and mutual support.
They refer victims to one another to ensure the best match of victims and agency (geography, culture, language,
etc.) and consult one another daily regarding victim needs, services, and the intricacies of the civil and criminal
justice systems in Cook County. This partnership will continue under the final year of this grant, assuring that
all CAASE clients have access to a qualified attorney and a victim advocate provided by a partner rape crisis
center. CAASE also partners with pro bono attorneys in Chicago to train members of the private bar to take or
co-counsel on cases with CAASE attorneys.

Priorities

Needs, Core Services, More Advocates, More Places, And Underserved Populations.
Program Funding Detail
This designation would support 12 months of funding, representing Year 3, or months 25 through 36 of
programming. Any future designation recommendations for this program will be pursuant to a new Notice of
Funding Opportunity, staff analysis of past program performance, and will depend on fund availability.
Past Performance
By the end of the third quarter of Year Two of this program CAASE continued to meet or exceed objectives in a
number of categories, including providing victims with legal assistance related to the number of clients
receiving assistance with exercising victim rights other than victim impact statements; the number of clients
receiving assistance related to plenary protective orders; interventions with schools/colleges needing to address
the consequences of victimization; and vacation/expungement of criminal records for victims of sex trafficking.
In addition, CAASE anticipates that during the fourth quarter of the grant funded year, CAASE will be able to
achieve or exceed its goals related to the overall number of adult clients provided with comprehensive legal
assistance services; the number of clients receiving assistance with completing a victim impact statement; the
number of clients receiving assistance related to campus protective orders; and the number of clients who
accessed services to complete crime victims’ compensation request.

CAASE is meeting most of its objectives, both based on the quantitative measures that it sets and tracks and
based on historical data of referral trends, which generally increases during spring and summer. They continue
to see a high demand for CAASE’s representation particularly for survivors interacting with criminal justice
system and for survivors seeking educational advocacy. This demand shows the success of CAASE’s efforts to
make referral partners and survivors aware of the representation they offer that is distinct and unique from other
providers of legal services for survivors of sexual violence.
The only significant gap between the objective laid out for Year Two and the projected total was in the area of
employment representation. For a significant part of the grant period, a CAASE Senior Staff Attorney, who is
the main provider of employment representation, has been out on maternity leave. Other CAASE attorneys
handled her client caseload while she was out, but overall, CAASE has had decreased legal capacity to offer
employment-related advocacy. As this staff attorney will be returning prior to the start of Year Three, they
expect to increase capacity to provide employment representation again and do not anticipate difficulty meeting
this objective during the final grant year.

Program Description
Domestic Violence Legal Clinic (DVLC) seeks support for continued delivery of a complete continuum of civil
legal services to survivors of domestic violence, including family law, immigration services and legal assistance
related employment, and consumer and housing issues. Domestic Violence Legal Clinic provides all services
with the help of a client support coordinator and in accordance with the principles of trauma-informed care.
Program Activities
With Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grant support, DVLC created an Extended Services Division, adding two
family law attorneys, an immigration attorney, and a generalist attorney who handles employment, consumer,
and housing matters arising out of clients’ victimization. The generalist attorney also assists clients in accessing
the Crime Victims Compensation Fund. Additionally, the division houses a client support coordinator
(advocate) and an intake specialist. These services have ensured that hundreds more survivors of domestic
violence receive the services and support they require to make a permanent end to the cycle of violence, attain
financial independence, and begin safe, sustainable lives for themselves and their children. DVLC seeks VOCA
support to sustain these activities and its ongoing work on hundreds of open domestic violence cases.

case management. The hire of this staff member has increased numbers in employment assistance and
consequences of victimization.

● Filing a motion to vacate or expunge a victim’s conviction, or similar action, based on his/her status of
being a victim, where permitted under Illinois law
Goals
With continued support from ICJIA, Erie Neighborhood House proposes to serve at least 60 victims of sexual
assault or domestic violence in FY20 through legal consultation or representation in immigration benefits.
Priorities
The 2017 Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee priorities fulfilled under this program include Fundamental
Needs, Core Services, More Advocates, More Places, and Underserved Populations.
Funding Prospectus
ICJIA staff expects to fund this program for the final year of a three-year NOFO. Staff will continue analyze the
program to ensure it is meeting its goals and objectives.
Past Performance
This fiscal year, Erie House is on track to meet or exceed most of its performance measures. During quarters 1
through 3, legal staff provided 43 victims of domestic violence or sexual assault with immigration legal
services. These 43 individuals also were offered counseling and case management services to help support them
throughout their immigration application, and a total of 12 individuals took advantage of these services.
Counseling services were provided by the victim advocate/bilingual social worker who offered socio-emotional
support to clients. The victim advocate and immigration attorneys developed a referral process that eased
immigration legal service client access to counseling services. Roughly half of individuals served had limited
English proficiency and accessed translation services. Finally, 15 individuals were represented in their U-visa
cases and are currently in the process of receiving residency.

Request Type:

NOFO #1395-217

Program Description
The mission of the Highland Park-Highwood Legal Aid Clinic (HPHLAC) is to provide legal services for lowincome individuals that live or work in Highland Park or Highwood. It was created in response to a needs study
in 2013 that found that those most vulnerable in our community had no access to justice in the areas of Housing,
Immigration and Domestic Violence.
According to our case statistics, the vast majority of our cases to date are people who live in Highland Park,
Highwood, and other towns in Southern Lake County with only 6% from Cook County. While there are other
low- or no-cost legal service providers in Lake and Cook Counties, they are, at a minimum, 20 minutes away by
car, and even further by public transportation. The distance is far enough to be burdensome to our client
population.
Program Activities
To provide civil legal assistance to individuals for a variety of services including:
Emergency Legal Assistance
 Filing for emergency restraining or protective orders
 Obtaining emergency custody orders and visitation rights
Victims’ Rights Enforcement
 Assisting victims in asserting their rights as victims or otherwise protecting their safety, privacy, or
other interests as victims, in a criminal proceeding directly related to the victimization
Civil Legal Assistance
 Proceedings for protective/restraining orders /stay-away orders
 Family, custody, support, respite care, or dependency matters
 Contract, housing, or employment matters
 Immigration assistance
 Intervention with creditors, law enforcement (e.g., to obtain police reports), and other entities

Past Performance
For Year Two, the grantee is on their way to achieving, if not exceeding, all of their goals. As of May 9, 2019,
they had already served 144 clients, exceeding their stated goal for all of Year Two for 140. The number of
adult client requesting services nearly doubled from Quarter Two to Quarter Three, as did those receiving
assistance with plenary orders, and the number who received assistance with emergency orders of protection
more than doubled. They have increased their outreach efforts and are in the process of strengthening
partnership within the community and with other grantees (i.e. CAASE).
Their biggest challenge is having more potential clients than they can take on. One way they have met this
challenge is by thoroughly preparing clients for hearings that they cannot attend.
This grantee has moved locations once already due to growth, and mentioned in their site visit that they may
have to move again in another year.

Program Description
LAF provides comprehensive legal services to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking,
financial exploitation, and elder abuse. It partners with eight other domestic violence social service providers in
suburban Cook County in addition to its own referrals and services for clients. LAF provides comprehensive
legal screenings of victims and then legal services for the victims. This includes assistance with emergency
protective orders, visitation rights, plenary protective orders, assistance related to non-emergency family law
matters, immigration matters, consumer creditor and financial fraud, and crime victim compensation.
Program Activities
Emergency Legal Assistance: LAF provides emergency legal services by assisting with emergency orders of
protection (EOPs), civil no contact orders (CNCOs), and stalking no contact orders (SNCOs). It also handles
emergency motions in extended litigation cases, including visitation and support issues, or as otherwise needed.
Civil Legal Assistance: The vast majority of LAF’s cases fall under the civil legal assistance category. The
agency represents victims on all civil legal issues resulting from victimization including housing, immigration,
family/domestic relations, consumer, employment, public benefits, and crime victims’ compensation. Each of
these areas relates to short and long-term safety, economic stability, and helps victims get back on their feet
after experiencing trauma.
Domestic Violence/Sexual Violence Victims: LAF assists with EOPs, CNCOs, and SNCOs and screen for and
provide legal services to address other matters, including divorce, custody, visitation, child support, protecting
victim’s employment, housing, immigration status, consumer rights, and income supports.
Human Trafficked Victims: LAF addresses the legal matters human trafficking victims experience including
their immigration status and employment issues. When necessary, the agency connects victims to specialized
trafficking service providers.
Elderly Victims/Financial Exploitation: LAF assists elderly victims with cases related to financial exploitation.
Elderly individuals are highly susceptible to financial abuse at home and fraud in the marketplace and they
often have difficulty navigating the administrative application process.

Program Description
Land of Lincoln is the sole provider of the full range of civil legal services for low-income persons in 65
counties in central and southern Illinois, offering services in five regional offices, three satellite offices, and a
centralized intake, advice, and referral center. The service area is comprised of over 32,500 square miles
covering approximately 60 percent of the state. Demand for order of protection assistance, family law cases,
and other areas of civil law on behalf of victims is extremely high. After an order of protection is entered,
litigation over custody, child support, visitation, and property issues is often protracted as abusers use the legal
system in one last attempt to control their victims. Advocacy on legal issues that promote safety and stability,
including public benefits, housing, and consumer issues may be necessary to ensure the protection and wellbeing of the victim and the victim’s family.
Program Activities
Land of Lincoln Legal Aid staff will continue to engage in advice, representation, advocacy, community
education, and collaboration to serve victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Agency
attorneys provide advice, brief services, and court representation in interim and plenary order of protection
cases, civil no contact orders, dissolution of marriage, custody, visitation, child support, and maintenance. In
order of protection cases, they also advocate for exclusive possession of the marital home and temporary
custody, and, in dissolution cases, they advocate for custody, child support, maintenance, and favorable division
of marital property and debt.
In addition to providing direct legal assistance, Land of Lincoln creates and distributes brochures with legal
information and general service information, as well as issues involving victims of violence. Staff members also
engage in regular outreach at local domestic violence agencies and shelters, where they provide community
legal education on victims’ rights and the court process involved in obtaining orders of protection. Staff VOCA
attorneys meet quarterly with local domestic violence agencies to discuss victims’ challenges and to evaluate
the streamlined referral process between agencies to ensure seamless provision of services.
In Year 3, Land of Lincoln will continue its partnership with Illinois Legal Aid Online (ILAO) and Prairie State
Legal Services to enhance online contact and referral of victims outside the Chicago metropolitan area. The
agency has worked with ILAO to develop and implement a Victims of Crime Portal, accessible through ILAO’s
website. Victims can choose to complete an online intake for our services or call the local regional office

serving the victim’s county. During Year 3, ILAO plans to continue improving and developing additional
content for the portal, which may include: ongoing updates of available resources for advocates; an advocate
manual for attorneys assisting clients who are victims of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault; and an
online referral portal for social service and other agencies to electronically refer clients to Land of Lincoln and
Prairie State.
Additionally, staff will attend and conduct trainings to improve services to victims. They will plan and ensure
compliance with VOCA domestic violence and family law training requirements, including trauma-informed
response training.

Program Funding Detail
This designation would support 12 months of funding representing Year 3, or months 25 through 36 of 36
months of programming.
Past Performance
During Year 1, the grantee met or exceeded all objectives. They projected that they would provide services to
645 victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault regarding orders of protection, no contact orders,
dissolutions of marriage, and other family matters, including custody, visitation, and child support. They
provided services to 1,583 victims. They also exceeded projections they would assist 335 clients with plenary
orders of protection or civil no contact orders and 140 clients with other family matters, including divorce,
custody, child support, and maintenance. During Year 1, they assisted 405 clients with orders of protection and
no contact orders and 193 clients with other family matters. In addition, their VOCA-funded staff attended the
victims’ rights enforcement training conducted by ICJIA in Chicago and Springfield, as well as a local traumainformed response training.
For Year 2, the agency projected service provision to 1,100 victims. During the first three quarters of Year 2,
they provided services to 1,310 victims. Staff also projected they would assist 335 clients with plenary orders of
protection or civil no contact orders and assist 140 clients with other family matters, including divorce, custody,
child support, and maintenance. During the first three quarters, they assisted 278 clients with orders of
protection and no contact orders and 262 clients with other family matters. In addition, their VOCA-funded staff
attended a trauma-informed response training, as well as other substantive trainings on domestic violence and
family law.
This grantee has attended victims’ rights enforcement training conducted by ICJIA, trauma informed training,
domestic violence training, and family law. They also have continued to cultivate their partnership with Prairie
State and LAF to help victims to ensure the victims’ needs are being met.

Program Description
Life Span will use FFY17 Victims of Crime Act funds to provide civil legal services in family law and
immigration and criminal court advocacy to victims of domestic and sexual violence in Chicago and the
Northern and Northwest suburbs. VOCA funds will enhance efforts to promote and direct clients to our services
with an emphasis on outreach to immigrants. The program will collaborate with agencies serving specific
populations such as KAN-WIN, Arab American Family Services, and Apna Ghar. Life Span will engage in
culturally and linguistically specific outreach in partnership with these agencies.
Program Activities
The attorneys will offer legal representation for orders of protections and then provide representation for divorce,
custody, visitation, and parentage cases. These litigation services have been crucial in offering clients a permanent
solution to the legal aspects of domestic violence. Battered women need skilled, specially trained civil lawyers to
deal with the issues of divorce, custody, and visitation. Attorneys also will represent victims of sexual assault for
civil no contact orders.
The immigration attorneys and a Board of Immigration Appeals Accredited Representative will represent
victims and their children in Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and U-Visa matters.
Advocates will provide advocacy relating to possible criminal charges and criminal procedures. Advocates
work with the attorney to ascertain the client’s collateral needs and refer them to other agencies for services the
organization does not provide. If a client is pressing criminal charges, an advocate will accompany the client to
criminal court and advocate for her.
All staff will help victims enforce their rights under the Illinois Domestic Violence Act, Illinois’ Victims
Economic Security and Safety Act, Title IX of the U.S. Civil Rights Act, VAWA and Illinois’ Safe Homes Act.

Program Funding Detail
This designation would support 12 months of funding representing Year 3, or months 25 through 36 of 36
months of programming.
Past Performance
Staff have no concerns about this program. The grantee hit or exceeded all goals except for three. This is due to
reporting changes in the 2nd quarter. Reporting changes captured new clients only and not the combination
between first year and second year. With cases taking longer than a year to complete, ICJIA found that numbers

Template Revision Date: 04/16/2019 

119

 VOCA FFY17

were a combination of previous clients still continuing services and new clients. The goals the grantee did not
meet include: Clients will receive assistance with transportation; Clients will receive assistance related to filing
a motion to vacate and/or expunge certain convictions based on their status of being victims; Clients will
receive assistance related to interventions with law enforcement and/or prosecutors for the purpose of obtaining
U-Visa certifications.
With the climate of immigration and the way Life Span receives referrals, most clients have either worked out
the transportation and eviction notices or they fear to apply due to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
being present at certain court houses.

Program Description
Through its Safe Families Program, Domestic Violence Team, and Victim Legal Assistance Network (no longer
exists under this name, but is now a part of the Individual Rights & Social Justice Practice Group), the Legal
Aid Society provides civil legal assistance to survivors of domestic violence and victims of crime.
Program Activities
1. Safe Families Program (SFP): SFP is a partnership with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office that
provides direct representation to victims of domestic violence in actions to obtain orders of protection
when the victim is a complaining witness in a criminal case against their abuser and the victim and the
abuser have children in common. SFP works to obtain child related remedies to ensure that their clients
maintain separation from their abuser and maintain stability. These child related remedies include, but
are not limited to, physical possession of the child(ren), child support, and a set parenting time schedule.
Additionally, SFP provides referrals regarding other legal issues, including but not limited to family law
and immigration. SFP further provides limited assistance with issues related to VESSA, Crime Victim’s
Compensation, and Safe Home Acts; if SFP cannot provide assistance, they provide direct referrals to
DVLC for extended representation on those matters. Finally, SFP provides referrals to counseling,
advocacy, and other social service programs.
2. Domestic Violence Team (DV Team): The DV Team represents victims of domestic violence in civil
orders of protection and domestic relations cases. Legal issues addressed by the DV Team include but
are not limited to custody, parenting time, child support, orders of protection, dissolution of marriage,
and division of property and debts in a dissolution action.
3. The Victim Legal Assistance Network (VLAN) (which has now ceased to exist under this name and is
instead part of the Individual Rights & Social Justice Practice Group): VLAN collaborates with legal aid
providers, advocates, and other agencies to ensure that crime victims receive integrated legal and social
services. Additionally, VLAN provides legal representation on immigration matters, including T and U
Visa applications and VAWA relief.

Past Performance
The grantee, in the past two years, has successfully established a relationship with the States Attorney’s Office
to promote Domestic Violence Representation. The grantee has missed a few goals because often, once they
receive their clients, the clients have already received services from other providers. The grantee has stated any

issue they have had is in relation to the number system changing in the clerk’s office. The grantee reported that,
due to referrals and judges understanding the grantee’s position in the courthouse, the relationship with the
State’s Attorney’s Office has flourished. The grantee has gained recognition such that they, potentially, will be
a joint speaker with the Cook County’s State Attorney Office at the End Violence Against Women International
conference.

Past Performance
The program did not meet majority of its goals due to change in collecting data. ICJIA asked about new clients
in each quarter and not clients overall. Grantee had an unclear explanation on how to record data quarterly.

After explanation was presented grantee, presented information on new clients each quarter instead of
combining first year data with current. In addition, the program was challenged by staff turnover, staff on
family and medical leave, and other vacancies within the agencies, including one to be filled by an immigration
attorney. Without an immigration attorney, fewer clients received immigration services. The grantee began
establishing a transportation service but the ramp up time was prohibitive. The grantee is unsure what is causing
the decrease with assisting clients with limited English proficiency. This might be due to the climate of
immigration.

English-speaking victims served. The grantee has served 707 of its projected 750 victims to date this fiscal year.
Staffing issues interfered with fulfillment of the grantee’s meeting objectives. A 65% FTE attorney in Ottawa
announced their retirement and reduced hours, which also impacted service delivery. Staff was hired in May to
provide some overlap in services for training and transfer of cases in a sustainable manner. A change in
reporting requirements to include only services provided in the quarter in which the case is opened also
impacted performance results.

In addition, because it is hard to estimate the amount of attorney resources any individual case will take, it can
be difficult to accurately project how many victims will be served. Project attorneys have continued in Year 2 to
provide quality holistic services to a large number of victims; the ability to provide quality services comes in
part from taking steps to limit services when it is necessary to maintain high-quality legal representation in
existing cases and avoid staff burnout.

Program Funding Detail
These designations would support 18 months of programming at each agency, representing a second 18-month
funding period (July 1, 2019, through December 31, 2020). These will be the final designations of the
programs’ 36 months of funding, as stipulated in the original notice of funding opportunity. Any future
designation recommendations for this program will be pursuant to a new Notice of Funding Opportunity, staff
analysis of past program performance, and will depend on fund availability.
Past Performance
With the exception of McHenry County CASA, all programs recommended by staff for continuation funding
have been successfully implemented.
ICJIA staff conducted a programmatic site visit and audit of McHenry County CASA to identify site issues.
Staff recommends a designation to support McHenry County CASA for another 12 months, during which time a
corrective action plan will be developed by staff and presented to the agency for completion. Staff will provide
technical assistance and continued monitoring of the program to ensure issues are addressed. Upon satisfactory
completion of the requirements of the corrective action plan, staff will make another recommendation to the
