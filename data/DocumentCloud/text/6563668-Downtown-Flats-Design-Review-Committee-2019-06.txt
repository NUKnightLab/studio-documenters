20, June 2019

DF2019-011

• Seeking Schematic Approval for the proposal.
• This project is for the proposed construction of new residential townhomes.
• This is the 3rd phase of the Avenue townhomes and the 2nd phase affiliated with
Knez Homes.
• The development consists of (27) townhomes.
• The townhomes will range in size from 1,900 Sf – 2,800 sf and be primarily (3)
stories with varying configurations of penthouses and roof decks.
• The proposed site config. Will complement the previous phases as well as the
surrounding environment and establish a strong presence on Superior Ave.

• Project will be presented to the Planning Commission for approval on 6/21

 PROJECT SUMMARY
The Avenue Townhomes – Knez Phase 2
The proposed Avenue Townhomes project is located on Superior Avenue between E. 14th St. and
E. 15th St. The project site is 0.849 acres. This is the third total phase of development for the
Avenue Townhomes, and the second phase affiliated with Knez Homes. The site is bordered to
the north by the original Avenue townhome development, consisting of two buildings containing
10 attached townhomes each. To the east is the Milton Townhouse development consisting of
16 townhome style apartments. The site is bordered to the south by commercial buildings and
a surface parking lot, and to the west by the first phase of Knez affiliated Avenue Townhomes, a
12-unit townhome building. The property and all adjacent properties are zoned Semi-Industry.
The proposed development includes 27 townhomes. There are a variety of townhome sizes and
configurations to provide diversity in pricing and lifestyle. The townhome sizes will range from
approximately 1,900 SF – 2,800 SF. The townhomes will be three stories, with varying
configurations of penthouses and roofdecks. All units will incorporate attached garages. Private
services will be managed by a homeowners’ association including landscape maintenance and
snow removal. At this level of development all finishes and materials have not yet been
determined. As such, an estimated base home price is not currently available. Units will be
market rate, fee simple townhomes.
The proposed site configuration will complement the previous phases of development as well as
the neighboring apartments. It will establish a strong street presence on Superior Ave. with a
clear delineation between public and private areas. This type of development promotes a
walkable urban neighborhood and will provide more inventory of a sought-after housing type in
Downtown Cleveland. The development fits within the RA-3 zoning standards. No zoning
variances are anticipated for this project.
Knez Homes is a leader locally and nationally in sustainable development and the building and
selling of homes. All Knez homes meet or exceed the Enterprise Green Building Standards and
Energy Star Guidelines. Knez designed communities and products are award winning and desired
by customers at a variety of price points. Knez has a proven track record of performance and
success within Cleveland Neighborhoods and looks forward to the opportunity to extend that
success with the Avenue Townhomes community.
