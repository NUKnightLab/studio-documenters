BLACK BOTTOM

This street was once part of Black
Bottom, a residential community that
was largely African American during
the first half of the twentieth century.
Due to segregation, the neighborhood
was mostly socially and economically
independent. Black-owned enterprises,
such as grocery stores, restaurants and
shops, occupied its street corners and
the business district along Hastings
Street. Churches and schools provided
residents with social spaces and a
sense of belonging. In the 19503-603,
the Detroit government razed most of
Black Bottom as part of its urban
renewal and ?slum clearance? plan.
Lafayette Park and Freeway
(1-3 75) replaced the community. Many
families were displaced and given no
resources for relocation. They retained
their connections to each other through
several Black Bottom churches that
endured into the twenty??rst century.

BLACK BOTTOM

p?L

Named for its dark marsh soils, Black
Bottom was a neighborhood roughly
bound by Gratiot Avenue, St. Aubin
Street, Larned Street and Brush Street.
European immigrants settled here in
the mid-nineteenth century. Between
World Wars I and II it became home to
thousands of African Americans who
migrated from the South in search of a



better future offered by factory work.
11 Housing discrimination forced them
12 into neighborhoods like Black Bottom.
13 They paid overpriced rent and often
14 packed multiple families into single
15 homes as they built a new community.
16 Those who grew up in Black Bottom
17 included Coleman Young, Detroit?s
18 ?rst black mayor; Joe Louis, the world
19 heavyweight boxing champion from
20 1937 to 1949; and Ralph Bunche, the
21 first black recipient of the Nobel Peace
22 Prize, honored in 1950 for his role as a
23 mediator with the United Nations.
