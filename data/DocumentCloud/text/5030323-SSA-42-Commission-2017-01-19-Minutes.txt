4. Sharon Lewis gave a recap of the holiday pop up project. Though there

were not as many visitors as hoped or expected some valuable lessons
were learned. The project needs the full support of the chamber, there is
a need for more focused planning and planning for the project should
begin in May or June to give proper time to execute plan elements,
select vendors and raise public awareness.

5. We received four responses to the RFP for an event planner. Staff felt
the proposal from Relevant Marketing was the strongest, but since the
responses were received shortly before the meeting, the commissioners
wanted an opportunity to review the proposals before making a decision.
Staff is to get copies to the commissioners, who will make a decision at
the February meeting.

6. The terms of three commissioners (Karim, Hurt and Jackson) are
expiring is April. Staff will get the applications to the three and hand
deliver the paperwork to City Hall in order to expedite the renewal
process. Commissioner Small reminded everyone that he is soon leaving
town and his seat will need to be filled. At present we have five
vacancies.

7. Allpoints reported that bad weather and a stronger police presence has
put a mils damper on incidents of illegal behavior. They have not yet met
with the District Commander. Alderman Hairston will make sure that this
meeting will take place. The Cleanstreet year-end summary was read. It
was noted that Clean Slate will perform landscaping duties in 2017.

8. The Executive director presented the year ?end report. The SSA made
significant steps last year, but there are some open ends. CPD needs to
better patrol the 76th Street Jewel parking lot, a move that will require
coordination of the three affected wards. The SSA website needs to get
up and running. We need to establish a schedule to get local vendors to
individually attend commissioner meetings.

9. Our 2017 budget currently stands at $597,470, not including a $39,000
carryover from 2016. The Executive Director proposed that the budget
be amended to distribute the $39,000 as follows; $20,000 added to
Special Events, $5,000 added to Holiday Decorations, and $14,000
added to Landscaping. Further, she recommended that the Banners
budget be reduced by $5,000. No action will be taken until February. The
Alderman requested that the budget accurately reflect the operational
expenses of the SSA and the chamber. Also, she suggested that the legal
status of the chamber (name and officials) be updated.

10. The financials were reviewed. There was no action required.

11. There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned.
