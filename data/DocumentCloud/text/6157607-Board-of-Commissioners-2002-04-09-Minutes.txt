MORATORIUM ON NEW HEARINGS FOR THE VARIANCES FOR CELLULAR
TOWERS TO BE LOCATED WITHIN RESIDENTIALLY ZONED DISTRICTS IN
UNINCOPORA TED COOK COUNTY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by Herbert T. Schumann and William R. Moran, County
Comm issioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution:
PROPOSED RESOLUT ION
Whereas, the regulation and zoni ng control of Cellular Radio Facilities, commonly referred to
as Cellular Towers, in the unincorporated areas of Cook County was adopted in 1995; and
Whereas, the Ordinance allows for permits to be issued for Cellular Towers in residentially
zoned districts where the height of the tower is limited to fifty feet, and, however, where a
variance in height to exceed the limit is permissible if granted by the Cook County Zoning
Board of Appeals; and
Whereas, the variances as to the height of these towers are not limited by the Ordinance; and
Whereas, one result of the granting of the height variances has been an increase in the number
of applications for the location of Cellular Towers withi n residential districts throughout
unincorporated Cook County; and
Whereas, residents throughout unincorporated Cook County have made various attempts to
oppose the towers in their residential neighborhoods on the basis of the inappropriateness and
incompatibility as commercial structures placed within residential areas, among other
considerations; and
Whereas, the Zoning Board of Appeals has been placed in the untenable position of having to
adjudicate these variances by having to weigh between the business purposes of the
telecommunications industry and the peaceful well being of residential neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the ongoing issuance of building permits and/or zoning relief under the existing
ordinance undermines the ability of Cook County to effectively regulate the proliferation of
Cellular Towers within residentially zoned districts throughout the unincorporated areas of
Cook County.
Now, therefore be it resolved as follows:
From the date of the adoption of this Resolution and until a complete review of the pertinent
Article(s) and Section(s) of Building and Zoning Ordinances of Cook County has been
completed, there shall be a moratorium on new hearings for the variances for Cellular Towers
to be located within residentially zoned districts at the Cook County Zoning Board of Appeals.
The Commissioner of Building and Zoning shall take appropriate measures to inform the
Zoning Administrator and the Zoning Board of Appeals of this moratorium.
If, upon the expiration of six months from the date of adoption of this moratorium, the review
of the pertinent Articles and Sections of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance has not been
concluded, the moratorium hereby imposed shall be reviewed and the County Board shall
determine whether basis exists to extend the moratorium for a further period of time.

LEGISLATION REGARDING ANNEXATION AND THE FUTURE USE OF LAND
LOCATED WITHIN COOK COUNTY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by William R. Moran, Cook County
Commissioner:
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, accord ing to Illinois Statute (65 ILCS 5/7-1-47), when a municipality annexes an
area of land the territory is automatically zoned as the highest restrictive zoning classification
providing principally for residential use under the municipal ity's zoning ordinance; and
WH EREAS, this land can be rezoned when it is annexed by the municipality and is
automati cally changed if the municipality' s zoning ordinance does not match the County's
current zoning classification for the property; and
WHEREAS, the current process of zoning does not consider the best use of the land within
the County as set by the County zoning classification; and
WH EREAS, the County puts forth a great deal of effort in order to set the zoning
classifications for county land, however once this land is annexed by a municipality the
County's zoning ordinance and classification is ignored; and
WHEREAS, the County zoning classification should be respected and considered by the
annexing municipality in deciding the possible use of the land; and
WHEREAS, at the very least notification should be provided to a County when a portion of
that County's land is being annexed;
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
urges the lllinois General Assembly to review the current legislation regarding annexation
and the future use of land located within Cook County taking special care to include the
issues mentioned in this Resolution.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be sent to The
Honorable George H. Ryan, Governor, and the honorable Members of the Illinoi s General
Assembly.

Commissioner Moran moved that the Proposed Resolution be approved and adopted. The motion
died for lack of a second.

250616

REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT CLASS IFICAT ION ORDINANCE (PROPOSED
ORDfNANCE AMENDMENT). Transmitting a Communication, dated March 18, 2002
from James M. Houlihan, Cook County Assessor:
I am presenting to you for the consideration of the County Board of Commissioners,
proposed language amending the Cook County Classification Ordinance relating to C lass 9,
Section 8 building units, reduction of the assessment level for C lass 3 properties, and
expand ing Class L (Landmark) designation.
The language relating to C lass 9, Section 8 will help to prevent the displacement of critical
Section 8 units that, witho ut this assistance, might otherwi se be converted to condominiums.
It applies to multi-family buildings where at least 20% of the units are Section 8 and is
applicable only to units in those buildings that are Section 8.
The supply of Cook County multi-family rental housing has diminished by over 5,000 units
in the last I 0 years and no market rate; non-subsidized affordable rental housing is currently
being developed. In o rder to maintain housing options for middle class fami lies and to
attempt to reverse the 32% decline in C lass 3 multi-family parcels, it is recommended that the
assessment level for these properties be 30 % in tax year 2003 and 26% in tax year 2004,
these amounts reflecting the recalibration during the next assessment cycle .
Lastly, because it is desirable to encourage not only the preservation and rehabi litation of
individually designated commercial and industrial historically and architecturally significant
buildings, but also multi-family and not-for-profit buildings and the contributing buildings
within landmark distri cts; the definition of landmark properties has been expanded to
included such parcels.

amended to read as follows:
The Cook County Board of Commissioners finds and declares:
( I)

that in certain areas of Cook County there is a lack of viable industrial and commercial bui ldings,
which is contributing to substantial unemployment in such areas;

(2)

that if existing industrial and commercial structures were improved and utili zed fu lly, and if new
industrial and commercial structures were developed, the County's economic well-being would be
improved by an increase in the level of economic activity, by increased employment opportunities
and by a growth in the real property tax base;

(3)

that because of the blighted or depressed condi tion of the areas where such development is
needed~ the ordinary una ided operation of private enterprise cannot accompl ish the necessary
modernization, rehabi litation and development, therefore provision must be made for public
assistance and encouragement of such private enterprises;

(4)

that the creation of new property tax classifications for (a) new deve lopment of industrial
structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing industrial structures, for
the County as a whole as well as fo r specific areas of special need, and (b) new development of
commercial structures, or the substantia l rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing commercial
structures in areas that are depressed, blighted or threatened w ith blight, is an appropriate and
necessary method of providing such assistance and encouragement, and wi ll result in increasing
the tax base in such areas and for the entire County; and
that the creation of a new property tax classification for the rehabilitation and new construction of
certain multifamily rental housing wi ll increase and improve the stock of decent, safe and
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households in Cook County, and wi ll remove
the blight or potential blight of deteriorating housing stock while a lso increasing the tax base of
the County.

(5)

(6)

that the amendment of real estate assessment classifi cations for the purpose of lowering the
assessment level for certain retention and deve lopment of the most affordable permanent housing
available to homeless and very low income individual s.

(7)

that the creation of a new property tax c lassification, to faci litate commercial and industrial
development through remediation of property, contam ination of which is not attributable to the
owner, is an appropriate and necessary method of providing assistance and encouragement to
achieve remediation and utilization of such property, which will result in increasing employment
opportunities as well as the tax base in the areas in which such sites are located and in the entire
County.

1447

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2002

(8)

that the C lass L creatioA of a Rew property tax classification, te will encourage the preservation
and rehabilitation of historically and architecturally significant commercial aAd iRdustrial
buildings, wi ll enhance the general character of real estate in the County and contribute to the
economic well-being of the County by increasing the level of economic activity, increas ing
employment opportunities and contributing to the long-term growth of the real property tax base.

(9)

that the creation of a new property tax classification to encourage the preservation and retention
of existing affordable rental housing units is necessary and beneficial to the population of Cook
County.

and health requirements and codes and (3) the Assessor determines that a ll application
qualifications, except the major rehabilitation or new construction req uirement, were
maintained during the incentive period.
When the Class 9 classification is due to expire or is terminated by action of the owner or

Class S

Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this ordinance, consisting of
land and existing buildings and structures, which is subject to a Section 8 contract that
has been renewed under the "Mark Up To Market" option, as defined herein. The portion
of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the
number of Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. Said proportion shall be
applied only to property used for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property,
if any, used for commercial purposes.
Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed
under the Mark Up To Market option, pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
I.

2.

HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the Mark Up to Market
option, after finding that:
A.

The property has recei ved a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an
ins pection by HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the
property is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected
Exigent Health and Safety (EHS) violations; and

B.

The property does not have a low-and-moderate-income use restriction that
cannot be eliminated by un ilateral action by the owner. If. however, the
current rent is lower than the use restriction, HUD may use the Mark Up To
Market option to increase the rents to the use restriction level, which would
be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and

C.

A Rent Comparability Study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that
comparable market rents are above 100% of the HUD Fai r Market Rent.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for 5 years of the Section 8 contract under its
discretionary authority relating to the Mark Up To Market option, after finding that
the property meets at least one of the required criteria:
A.

A vulnerable population is affected, or

B.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, wh ich would make tenant based
assistance difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

1464

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2002

C.

The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a
contribution of State or local funds to the property.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
I.

At least 20% of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low and
moderate-income persons.

2.

The owner(s) must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for
at least 5 years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

3.

For the duration of the Class S class ification period, applicant must file annually with
the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement
verifying continuous compliance with the Class S provisions of this Ordinance.

4.

Applicant must agree to notizy the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is
terminated prior to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor' s
office a copy of any Notice of Default or Notice of Abatement received from HUD.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal under the Mark Up To Market
Option, no less than I 20 days prior to the expiration of the contract, the applicant shall
notify the Assessor's Office of the application, on a form provided by that office. Upon
receiving approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the applicant shall file an
application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by that
office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter approving the
contract renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.
Any property which, as of the effective date of this Amendment to the Classification
Ordinance, has an existing Section 8 contract with a Mark Up To Market option may
apply for Class S class ification for the any portion of the 2001 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term,
including any renewals approved w ith the Mark Up To M arket option.
The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8
contract.
T he incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under the "Mark
Up To Market" option. Upon filing an application with H UD, no less than 120 days prior
to termination of the contract, for renewal of the Section 8 contract under the Mark Up
To Market option, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the Assessor's Office of its

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2002

Additionally, to qualify a Landmark building or Contributing Building for C lass L
classification, an e ligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year
prior to the commencement of Substantial Rehabilitation. After the Substantial
Rehabilitation has been com pleted, the Preservation Comm ission shall review the project
to determine that it is eligible hereunder. The applicant must supplement the eligibility

if the real estate is located in a n unincorporated area, and;
2. the municipality in w hich the real estate is located or the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County, if the real estate is located in an uninco rporated
area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local econo my, and supports and consents to
renewal of the C lass L, and
3.

a copy of that resolutio n and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.

assessment level is hig her than 16%, that taxpayer may apply fo r renewal as outlined
above and rece ive a 16% assessment level fo r the prescribed period beginning after the
filing and approva l of the resolutio n and renewal app lication. However, if as of the
effecti ve date, the tax payer' s assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no red uction of the current assessment
level based on renewal of the incentive wil l be g ranted. If no renewal is obtained, the
incenti ve sha ll be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 3 below. After

Section 4.
(A)

To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the
project be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(I)

(2)

the area is, or has been within the last I 0 years, designated by federa l, state or local
agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a
rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal
Consolidation Act of 1961 , as amended, or the Commercial Renewal Re-development
Areas Act of I 967, as amended, or that the area is located in a federal Empowerment
Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May I 8, 1994, or the
Commercial District Deve lopment Commi ssion Ordinance of the City of Chicago or
designation(s) of like effect adopted under any similar statute or ordinance; and
real estate taxes within said area, during the last six years, have declined, remained
stagnant or potential real estate taxes are not being fully real ized due to the depressed
condition of the area; and

(3)

there is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation
of the commercial development project is viable and Iikely to go forward on a reasonably
timely basis if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the
economic enhancement of the area; and

(4)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will
materially assist development, re-development or rehabilitation of the area and the
commercial development project would not go forward without the fu ll incentive offered
under Class 7a or 7b; and

(5)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities within the area.

Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibi li ty app li cation with the Assessor, an app li cant must obtain
from the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County ifthe real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that factors ( I)
through (5) are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports
and consents to the Class 7a or 7b app lication to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance
or resolution shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the time of filing the
application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted,
will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the secretary of the Board of Commissioners for
distribution to the Commissioners from the affected districts. The application shall include any
other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
commercial development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classifi cation and shall bear the
expense of doing so.

1469

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2002

Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of
Cook County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to lim it the
expense of such applications, the Assessor shall li berally construe the requirements of factors ( 1)
through (5) for Class 7a applications.
The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the appl ication
and supporting data.
Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient
size if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive
offered" as provided in factor (4) above, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of futu re profits with the
appropriate taxing districts.
For C lass 7a applications, where the Assessor find s that factors (1) through (5) exist, he shall,
within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data, certify the
commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Ordinance
Jn order to determi ne Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee
of Cook County. The Committee shall within thirty days return the app lication to the Assessor
with a finding stating whether factors (I) through (5) are present. Upon receipt of a written
request from the Committee no later than seven days prior to the expiration of the thirty day
period, the Assessor may extend for a period not to exceed an additional thirty days the time for
return of the application with the Committee's finding. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, fi ndings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds
factors ( 1) through (5) exist, he shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee' s findings,
certi fy the commercia l development project eligible fo r C lass 7b treatment under this Ordinance.
Class 7a and 7b certifications sha ll lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new
construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of
the commercial development proj ect has commenced prior to its expiration.
(8)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8
classification it is necessary: ( I) that the municipality in which the area is located or, if an
unincorporated area, the County determine by lawful resolution that the area is in a state of
economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish
the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public
assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import; (2) that the municipality or,
if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the area as one
in need of substantial_revita lization; (3) that, upon receiving an application to certify an area as in
need of_substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and
other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the severity of the economic conditions of
the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial revitalization_" requirement is met,
the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to the fact that an area is
located in a federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by
the Cook County Board of Comm issioners on J une 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May
18, 1994.

1470

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 9, 2002

Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this Ordinance, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area.
In making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the
specific area for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the
City of Chicago shall be the "community area" as defined herein; for all other areas in the County
it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.

(C)

If a municipality within an Enterpri se Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18,
1994, determines by municipal resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and
that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for C lass 8
certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this ordinance. However, each
property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file their application in a
timely manner.
"Effective January 1, 2001 , any Class 6a incentive that is sti ll active can be renewed. The Class
6a incentive is defined in the Cook County Real Property Classification Ordinance adopted and

thereto, and all rules promulgated by the Assessor hereunder, shall be submitted by the Cook County
Assessor to the President and Board of Cook County Comm issioners annually on or before December 1.
