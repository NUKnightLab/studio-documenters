SSA Commissioners? Statements

Snow Removal

Allstar Towing Snowplowing has been the snow removal contractor for the past three
winters. For the past two winters, the contract has been set a flat rate of $30,000 for the
season- Jim offered to design a contract where the chamber will receive a discount if
Allstar makes less than five service calls during the winter, but the chamber will pay a
premium for more than twenty service calls in one season. Following intense
discussion, Jim agreed to offer the same terms for the 2014-2015 season as was
offered in 2013?2014.

Mike motioned to renew the snow removal contract for 2014-2015 for the flat rate of
$30,000 per year or $85,000 for a three-year contact- Gina seconded the motion, and
the motion was approved unanimously.

were not comparable so they were unable to approve any of the submittals.

Since it has been two years since the last t?shirt order, employee shirt sizes are being
determined so a new order may be submitted.
