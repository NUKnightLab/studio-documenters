RECOMMENDATION TO ACCEPT AN INCREASED GRANT AWARD FROM THE
CITY OF CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY AND SUPPORT SERVICES AND
INCREASE THE COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET FOR THE SUMMER YOUTH
ENIPLOYMENT PROGRAM

To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:

RE MMENDATION

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (?Board?) authorize the Chief Executive
Of?cer or his designee to accept an award and increase the grant agreement with the City of
Chicago Department of Family and Support Services in the amount of $313,200 for
the DFSS Summer Youth Employment Program and to increase the FY 2012
comprehensive budget by the same amount. This additional grant award from DFSS can only be
utilized to pay stipends for 500 additional youth workers. The additional award increases the
DFSS grant amount to $1,113,200 to provide stipends for a total of 1,780 youth workers.

FUNDING SUMMARY
Grant Funds and General Fund
Original DFSS Grant Award (1,280 Youth Worker Stipends): 800,000
Increase to DFSS Grant Award (500 Additional Youth Stipends): 5 313,209
Total DFSS Grant Award (1,780 Youth Worker Stipends): 51,1 13,200


In May 2012, the Board authorized CHA to accept a grant in the amount of $800,000 from DFSS
to provide stipends for 1,280 youth and young adults ages 14-24 to participate in the SYEP.
Following the Board?s approval, CHA received noti?cation from DFSS that CHA would be
awarded an additional $313,200 to provide stipends for 500 more youth workers, increasing the
total grant award to $1,113,200 to provide stipends for a total of 1,780 youth and young adults to
participate in the SYEP. The DFSS award stipulates that the grant funds may only be used for
youth worker stipends. Accordingly, CHA will utilize Centers for New Horizons, Employment
and Employer Services, Heartland Human Care Services, Metropolitan Family Services, Near
West Side CDC and Uhlich Children?s Advantage Network (UCAN), as previously authorized
by the Board in May 2012 to implement the SYEP. These contractors will be assigned
additional youth worker participants based upon capacity and the distribution of the previously
approved administrative fees.

The SYEP is a youth summer training, skill development and employment opportunity for 14 
24 year olds. The intention of the SYEP is to provide Chicago youth and young adults with safe,
meaningful summer experiences, while learning valuable and transferable skills that connect life
lessons and academic preparation, ultimately enhancing participants? long-term employment
prospects. Participants will be engaged up-to 20 hours per week for 6-weeks. The anticipated
term for the program is July 9, 2012 through August 17, 2012. Youth participants will receive a
stipend up to $600 (based on attendance) for successfully completing the program and young
adult supervisors will receive up to $1,000 (based on attendance).

Conclusion

Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Of?cer or his designee to accept an award and increase the grant agreement with the City of
Chicago Department of Family and Support Services in the amount of $313,200 for
the DFSS Summer Youth Employment Program and to increase the FY 2012
comprehensive budget by the same amount. This additional grant award from DFSS can only be
utilized to pay stipends for 500 additional youth workers. The additional award increases the
DFSS not-to-exceed grant amount to $1,113,200 to provide stipends for 1,780 youth workers.

Board Letter dated June 13, 2012, entitled TO ACCEPT

DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY AND SUPPORT SERVICES AND INCREASE
THE COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET FOR THE SUMMER YOUTH
