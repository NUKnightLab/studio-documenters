Recommendation *

Completed

In Process

The project area is Level 3 of the NOACA Freight Network, meaning
relatively high truck counts. Design should consider their turning
movements mainly at the shopping center.
Include high-visibility crosswalks and pedestrian countdown heads with
the new signal at Portz Parkway. Include pedestrian crossing for Aurora
Road.
* Recommendations have been forwarded to the project sponsor for consideration and coordination.

The Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory Council (BPAC) Recommendations *

Completed

Consider providing less width to the vehicular lanes and more width to the
bike lane and/or create a buffer between the bike lane. However, the Safety
and Operations Council cautioned not to reduce the eastbound travel lane as
some cyclists may still choose to use the road rather than the side path.
Consider a shared use path on both sides of the road in lieu of the bike lane
(allocate the 5 feet to creating a path,10 feet wide, rather than a path, 5 feet
wide and a bike lane, 5 feet wide).
BPAC strongly recommends signing and or centerline striping on the new
multi-use path. Since the existing sidewalk on the south side is being
widened to serve as a multi-use path, BPAC recommends measures that will
identify that the facility has changed and cyclists are permitted on the path.
* Recommendations have been forwarded to the project sponsor for consideration and coordination.
