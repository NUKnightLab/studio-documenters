CHAIRMAN DALEY:

3

Commissioners, we are

4

going to have the Bureau of Economic Development.

5

Hopefully, Commissioner Gainer, we may be able to do

6

Technology and Human Resources before noon.

7

we will have one of the departments come back next

8

week.
The Bureau of Economic Development,

If not,

Herman Brewer.
MR. BREWER:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Today you will hear in detail the

12
13

important work of our team in the Bureau of Economic

14

Development over 2013 and our expectations for 2014.

15

Our work to date has been highly recognized for our

16

reinventions of how we are approaching economic

17

development in northern Illinois, and Cook County in

18

particular.

19

We have worked to restore the trust of

20

corporate, nonprofit, municipal, and civic partners.

21

By, one, creating an advisory council for this

22

President, reconstituting dormant advisory groups

23

and staff, and we have moved from being an entity on

24

a Federal watch list, with the Federal Government,
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 3

1

to being an award-winning body for the very same

2

work.

We have moved from troubled to clean audits.
We have been aggressive in pursuit of

3
4

proposals, both to Washington and to local

5

philanthropy, which has led to new resources,

6

revenues, and having been secured to do creative

7

work on behalf of our partners, our valued partners

8

and our most vulnerable municipalities and

9

populations.

All of this with many fewer FTEs,

10

significantly reduced annual Federal allocations and

11

County corporate funds.
I would like to begin by introducing

12
13

our team -- our Director of Planning and

14

Development, to the left, over here, talking with

15

glasses -- Mike Jasso.

16

Planning, John Cooke.

17

Ashcraft.

Building and Zoning, Tim Bleuher -- no

18

relation.

Still on his way over here is Andy

19

Przybylo, Secretary of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

20

We also have joining us Karen Norington-Reeves from

21

the Workforce Partnership, formerly Cook County

22

Works, and formerly a part of the Bureau of Economic

23

Development.

24

Our head of Capital
The head of Real Estate, Anna

I will begin by saying, Mr. Chairman,
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 4

1

that at the bureau level we have begun significant

2

staff reductions, and commensurate salaries, dating

3

back to 2011 up to today.

4

significant staff reductions in various departments.

5

We are increasing staff in other areas, particularly

6

in our Capital Planning area.

Overall, we have begun

7

But, more importantly, we are again

8

trying to drive new revenues for this County, and

9

seeing net increases in dollars coming to this

10

County, both from grants and sources based on

11

creative work of our team.
We will begin with a summary of our

12
13

work from the Real Estate area.

14

Ashcraft.

15
16
17

MS. ASHCRAFT:

I am asking Anna

Good morning, Commissioners.

Anna Ashcraft, Director of Real Estate Management.
The Real Estate Management Division's

18

mission is to manage the use and occupancy of all

19

real estate -- owned and leased real estate in the

20

County in order to ensure that the elected officials

21

and departments have space in which to efficiently

22

carry out their governmental functions.

23
24

In 2013 we have had several -- many
accomplishments.

The major accomplishment is the

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 5

1

completion of the real estate assessment that we

2

have been working on with US Equities for quite some

3

time.

4

accumulated a very essential database of information

5

on space use countywide, as well as floor plans;

6

which has provided us with the information that we

7

need in order to analyze space use and become more

8

efficient in space use, and deal with space requests

9

from the departments from time to time.

In the course of that project, we have

We have also identified top priorities

10
11

per implementation of that real estate assessment,

12

which will start in 2014, and it will enable us,

13

over time, to save significant sums of money on our

14

space use.
Our highlights for 2014 are the

15
16

implementation steps that we will be taking.

We

17

will begin consolidating our downtown office space

18

to achieve a more efficient space use ratio for our

19

administrative departments.

22

year or more.

1

in footprints that we hope to achieve; also

2

developing a plan to consolidate the Oak Forest

3

campus health uses and begin repurposing those

4

properties.
Our second focus is related; which is

5
6

to continue the efforts of the Space Allocation

7

Committee to evaluate the space requests by

8

department, and, over time, to consolidate those

9

uses.

We have worked hard to try to begin to

10

cultivate a culture where people, departments are

11

aware of the value of their space, which has been

12

frankly viewed as free in the past.

13

to achieve some of that.

14

department offer up space this year in 69 West

15

Washington that they were not using any more.

16

will be coming to the Board in the next couple of

17

months with a lease for that space.

We actually had a

Thank you.

With that, I will step aside and

We are starting

MR. JASSO:

Are there any questions?

Good morning, Commissioners.

My name is Michael Jasso, the Director of the
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

1

Department of Planning and Development.
Briefly, the mission of the department

2
3

is to foster economic opportunities and business

4

development; promote the retention and development

5

of affordable housing throughout the County; support

6

social services; and significantly leverage local

7

resources, public and private, that reflect local

8

priorities.
In 2013 the Department encouragingly

9
10

had a number of accomplishments.

11

Department and the County were awarded a $30 million

12

Section 108 loan guarantee, coming from HUD, which

13

is a loan guarantee program which supports the BUILT

14

in Cook program that we will be launching in 2014.

15

It successfully expended approximately $35 million

16

in Federal NSP dollars, which supported the

17

development of eighty-one home ownership units; 168

18

rental units; forty-two unit demolitions; and one

19

public facility across twenty suburban communities.

20

Some of these projects still remain in progress, but

21

these were significant projects in their respective

22

communities.

23
24

Significantly, the

We successfully expended over $15
million in Federal CDBG funds.

What is significant

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

1

about this -- this includes $6 million that

2

previously had been at risk due to the inability of

3

the County to successfully deploy those dollars in

4

previous years.

5

that HUD considers important in terms of the

6

expenditure.

7

funding from CDBG, but, hopefully, if opportunities

8

ever arise, for expanded funding.

9

So, in fact, we achieved measures

They ensured not only continued

We also committed $27.1 million of

10

previously undeployed Federal HOME dollars.

11

are Federal HOME Investment Partnerships Program

12

dollars that dated back to 2008 for the production

13

of affordable housing in ten eligible projects

14

across ten communities.

15

These

Realizing that in order to be

16

productive the Department, which is principally

17

federally-funded in terms of grant funds -- we

18

encouraged three northwest municipalities to join

19

the HOME consortium for HOME dollars.

20

the County to leverage larger dollars based on the

21

allocation funding mechanism that HUD utilizes.

22

This allows

The Department also manages and

23

administers a number of tax incentives.

Through

24

these incentives, we have encouraged $150 million in
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 9

1

private investment.

These, we believe, will result

2

in 1900 jobs, 600 retained, and provided assistance

3

to forty-eight businesses in twenty-two

4

municipalities.
Finally, in 2013, we saw the

5
6

reconstitution of the Economic Development Advisory

7

Committee -- EDAC -- whose role is to advise on

8

property tax incentives, such as the Class 7b, but

9

also to help in terms of advising on incentives,

10

policies, and strategies for investment.
As we move forward in 2014, the

11
12

Department, which is funded, as I mentioned, through

13

the Federal grants, we continue to see a challenging

14

environment.

15

context, the CDBG funding declined by thirteen

16

percent in that same period.

17

mention is for the affordable housing, declined by

18

thirty-six percent.

19

Between 2010 and 2013, to put this in

HOME funding, which I

The Department was awarded

20

approximately $14.5 million for 2014, in terms of

21

CDBG, ESG, and HOME funds, which, I believe, will

22

support twenty-nine capital improvement projects,

23

more than fifty social service agencies, and six

24

affordable housing projects, resulting in 485 units.
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 10

1

We continue to leverage resources for

2

outside grant opportunities, such as the successful

3

submission of a HUD choice neighborhoods planning

4

grant.

5

We continue to look at the expansion

6

of the HOME Consortium, as well as the CDBG Urban

7

County, all of which are ways to leverage more

8

Federal dollars.

9

We will be launching the

10

implementation of the BUILT in Cook loan fund, which

11

is supported through the $30 million Section 108

12

loan guarantee program.

13

We continue collaboration with sister

14

agencies and other entities, including the launching

15

of the Cook County Land Bank Authority, which will

16

be a critical player in the developing of

17

opportunities that exist throughout the County.

18

We also will be doing new things,

19

which we began this year, which is to leverage

20

private activity bonds, which is the first time in

21

over a decade that the County has done that.

22

is an opportunity to use access to tax-exempt

23

financing markets to promote both the affordable

24

housing, but also industrial-related projects.

This

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 11

Finally, we will be launching a five-

1
2

year strategic planning process that is required

3

both by the Department of Commerce for a

4

comprehensive economic development strategy, which

5

is CEDS, which basically places the priorities in

6

terms of economic development throughout the County.

7

But also a five-year consolidated plan which seeks,

8

through the usage of the CDBG funds and other

9

Federal HUD grants, dollars for the 2015 to the 2019

10

period.
Your final slide is the Department's

11
12

presentation which speaks to a number of metrics;

13

most notably, as I have mentioned, which is the

14

rental housing production which you will see in the

15

metric highlight.

16

the sponsorship of County programs, and we look

17

forward to continuing that.
With that, I will be ready for

18
19

It continues to increase under

questions.

20

CHAIRMAN DALEY:

21

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

22

Commissioner Fritchey.
Thank you.

How are you today?

23

MR. JASSO:

Good morning.

24

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

Thank you.

I was back in my

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 12

1

office, but I heard some of the earlier parts of

2

your statement.

3

are actually heightened a little bit by what you

4

stated.

5

I have a couple of questions that

When it comes to the community

6

development block grants -- when I look at the

7

numbers in the book, it looks as if only

8

approximately fifteen percent of what was

9

appropriated was actually given out.

I am looking

10

at the appropriations of $9.3 million and $1.4

11

million were distributed.

12

MR. JASSO:

I am joined by Dominick Tocci,

13

who is the program manager for CDBG.

14

some of that specifically.

He can address

15

If I could make a general comment with

16

respect to award lag; the funding utilization versus

17

the award lag.

18

the June cycle of any given year.

19

begins on October.

20

service agencies can begin at that point.

21

typically on a quarterly drawdown basis.

22

Typically, the awards are made in
The program year

Funding of any of the social
That is

The capital improvement projects

23

typically begin the following spring, simply because

24

of the construction cycle.

So there often is a lag

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 13

1

between what is shown as the award, which is the

2

appropriation, and the actual drawdown of funds.

3

am sure Dominick can elaborate on some of that.
COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

4

I

If there is a lag

5

in a drawdown, that drawdown would be reflected here

6

from the previous year.

7

is a discrepancy between what was appropriated and

8

what was actually given out.

9

MR. JASSO:

10

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

15
16
17

Welcome, Dominick.

You have been put on the block
MR. TOCCI:

13
14

I would ask Dominick to address

that.

11
12

One way or the other, there

Good morning.

Delighted to be

here.
I am Dominick Tocci, T-O-C-C-I, Deputy
Director of Community Development.
I guess I want to start, just to get

18

clarification -- can you tell me where you are

19

seeing this $1.4?

20

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

I am looking at

21

what was designated, on page M-1 in the budget book.

22

It is under the Bureau of Economic Development,

23

summary of appropriations.

24

restricted funds, line 942 is the community

When I look into the

development block grants.

2

appropriation -- $9,318,863.

3

through September 27 was $1,426,000.

4

math says that out of the $9.3 million that was

5

appropriated only about fifteen and a half percent

6

of that was actually distributed.

I am not familiar with that

That the expenditure

It says the 2013 adjusted

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

Of the $9.3 million,

What do you think

the correct number would be, approximately?
MR. TOCCI:

I think we expended probably

about seventy-five percent of that funding by now.
COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

You are saying that

this number is off probably by $5 million?
MR. TOCCI:

Yes.

I think that is a fair

statement.
MS. GIBSON:

If I may interject -- these

numbers are from the central financial system with

5

other expenditures that are in the pipeline that

wouldn't have been reflected in the final --

Mike Jasso mentioned that there is

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

This is
We can

Let me jump in for

8

one second.

Forgive me, but obviously you can

9

understand the issue though; that that money has got

10

to be somewhere.

Excuse me for one second.

I don't

11

want to take you down the road unnecessarily; I just

12

want to make sure that I am understanding something.
If over $9 million was appropriated,

13
14

and the numbers that we were given, the only numbers

15

that we were given is showing that $1.4 million were

16

distributed -- I understand what you are saying,

17

that maybe there is money in the pipeline.

18

the money in the pipeline going to be shown?

19

got to be accounted for somewhere to make all of

20

these numbers balance out.

21

MS. GIBSON:

Where is
It's

Yes, and I will be happy to

22

look at it.

I don't know the detail offhand, but

23

this is drawn down from our financial system.

24

will be happy to get back to you on that.

I

I think

1

this is a question maybe more for -- we can work

2

together, certainly, but it sounds like it is more

3

of a question for the Budget Office.
MR. TOCCI:

4

The one comment I was going to

5

make -- again, not knowing the exact number you are

6

talking about.

7

be the administrative portion of our expenditures.

The thought I had is that that could

8

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

9

want to say the administrative portion of

10

I don't think you

distributing $1.4 million was about $5 million.
MR. BREWER:

11

Commissioner, I will

12

reiterate.

In fact, this is a budget accounting

13

issue.

14

is reported in the book and where our expenditures

15

are to date.

16

information relative to our grants, which we can

17

provide, will show upwards of over seventy percent

18

of those monies having been put out.

There is a significant time lag between what

I can assure you that the updated

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

19

That makes sense.

20

I have little to no qualm of taking you at your

21

word.

22

fall on you or Dominick.

23
24

I guess my follow-up question, then, doesn't

Andrea, it's out of frustration as
much as confusion.

Here is this one line item where

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

there is approximately $5 million unaccounted for.

If this is the only information that we get, we have

3

nothing else to base this on.

4

5

know, and candidly CDBG doesn't really affect my

6

City District.

7

the issue is trying to get grants, and they are

8

saying that money is not available.

9

here, eighty-five percent of the money hasn't been

Nobody would have

I have talked to my colleagues, and

Then you look

11

that hasn't -- you are saying that the number, as

12

Dominick said, is closer to seventy percent.

13

still means that there is a few million that we

14

didn't use that was appropriated.
MS. GIBSON:

MS. GIBSON:

I apologize.

There is a lot

20

of information I have off the top of my head, but

21

this is one I have to look into.

22

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

There may be a

second one -- hold on -- in this same area.

We can't keep putting millions of

I will be happy to follow up with you

COMMISSIONER FRITCHEY:

Should there be something in that expenditure, even

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

11

With every

Thank you, Mr.

Chairman.
Herman, I don't know if my question is

12
13

to you or somebody else.

Mine is with regards to

14

the change in the CDBG program.

15

nineteen and a half years.

16

changed from what it used to be in the past.

17

past, CDBG was strictly used for infrastructure for

18

the different communities.

19

now you are funding social service agencies, which

20

was not something that we have ever done in the

21

past.

22

end of Cook County -- I think you and I have

23

discussed this -- when I talked to my Mayors to find

24

out from them who got CDBG funding, only one of them

I have been here

Your focus has truly
In the

Now your focus, I see

I ask that question because at the southern

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 24

1

has gotten funding.
They have infrastructure problems.

2

I

3

see that the monies that we were using previously

4

for infrastructure is now going for social service.

5

The reason why you have this, where HUD was saying

6

you weren't spending your money from CDBG because

7

those programs were done in phases.

8

were done in phases, you would not have spent all of

9

your money.

Yes, if they

Because if we were only trying to

10

allocate all of the money to different communities,

11

and there wasn't enough to say:

Okay, we are going

12

to give it all to you this year.

We will do it in

13

phase one, two, and three.

14

complete the project because you are not giving me

15

enough this year.

16

Then they got next year's money and they expended it

17

for the first phase, and then they had to wait for

18

two or three other years in order to get to the

19

second phase.

20

They say:

We can't

I will wait until next year.

So, yes, when HUD looked at your

21

books, you did have money on the books.

Now you are

22

saying you are spending the money down that was from

23

the prior years.

24

social services, you left those communities with no

But when you are also tacking on

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 25

1

way of doing infrastructure projects.

2

that.
MR. BREWER:

3

Yes.

Help me with

A few points you are

4

making here.

I will try to point out how we have it

5

here to what is expected from the Federal

6

Government.

7

One, I will begin by saying we had a

8

fairly dramatic shift in poverty and the needs for

9

the social services that we have begun to fund in

10

portions of suburban Cook County.
We now have more dramatic poverty and

11
12

social service stats in suburban Cook County than we

13

do in the City.

14

been asked to try and help develop and work and fund

15

the agencies that are providing that sort of

16

assistance to this very needy population.

17

been working in collaboration with the local

18

philanthropies, United Way, and others to try to

19

fulfill that need.

It is a dramatic shift, and we have

We have

The other is we have percentage caps

20
21

for the categories of things that we can expend the

22

CDBG dollars for.

23

exceed a certain cap for infrastructure in a given

24

year.

There is an expectation to not

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 26

I am going to get to your point about

1
2

the different projects from year to year.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

3

You mentioned social

4

services.

I want to go back to that one.

5

concern is, and I understand the needs -- when we

6

had Karen Norington-Reeves -- what was that

7

department called?

8

money that we used for WIA and the money that we

9

share now with the City, those were dollars we used

It was social services.

10

for social service programs.

11

been rolled into CDBG.

The

But now those have

MR. BREWER:

13

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

14

MR. BREWER:

15

for job development programs.

16

mix and match those.

17

providing counseling for domestic abuse.

That is actually incorrect.
No, that is correct.

Those were WIA dollars used
We can't necessarily

We didn't have agencies

18

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

19

was under that particular department.

20

I voted on it.

21

My

Oh, yes, we did.

That

I was here.

I know we did.

MR. BREWER:

Let me try and address the

22

issue you raised about public infrastructural work

23

and the annual allocations going to projects.

24

We have had a number of municipalities
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 27

1

who had unspent allocations for projects that we had

2

never started or not completed.

3

consideration.

4

Federal Government.

That was taken into

We were asked to address that by the

We have now begun to coordinate with

5
6

those municipalities to work with other dollars that

7

they have leveraged, along with the CDBG allocation,

8

like their local MFT funds and things of that

9

nature.

10

That is so our dollars are not allocated to

projects that have standalone dollars.
Along with the fact that we have a

11
12

significant reduction in those dollars, we have over

13

a twenty percent reduction, if not more, of those

14

dollars.

15

around.

16

very painful decisions.

17

guided by and advised by the Department of Housing

18

and Urban Development.

19

So there is many, many fewer dollars to go
We have had to make some very difficult and

No, we can't.

We can't tell

We can suggest and we have to stay within our

5

MR. BREWER:

I assure you that we cannot

6

continue the practice that has been underway here

7

prior to 2011-2010.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

8
9

I am not talking about

the practice that you had underway.

Herman, you

10

have lived in the south suburbs.

11

infrastructure needs in the south suburbs, and there

12

is no money to do those, where do you think those

13

communities are going to get those dollars from?

14

They relied on Cook County to get those dollars to

15

do that.

16

MR. BREWER:

When you have

17

our CDBG infrastructure dollars are being spent in

MR. JASSO:

reiterating Herman's comment, which is eighty-five

23

percent of the dollars are in infrastructure.

24

vast majority of that is in south suburban.

an infrastructure project that should have been

MR. JASSO:

But we can give

Once again, without knowing the

10

details of that project, I am happy to look at that

11

with staff as to why it wasn't funded.

12

instance, I don't know if CDBG in and of itself was

13

sufficient to actually ensure the completion of the

14

project.

15

look into that.

Those are all of the factors.

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

16

For

We will

My question, and I have

17

asked you this before, Herman:

18

coming to you, if it needs to be done in phases, you

19

no longer do phase projects?
MR. BREWER:

20

If a project is

It is not consistent now with

21

how the Federal Government wants to see dollars

22

expended.

23

some sort of phase approach, that is where we look

24

for leveraging other resources to see the complete

thing.

4

resources, and what other resources can be brought

5

together on behalf of those projects.

6

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

We want to be able to plan and leverage our

If there is nobody that

7

is going to help leverage those dollars, and you

8

have a municipality that says:

9

are talking about a Robbins or Ford Heights, where

I need this.

If you

10

they have no money, but they are trying to draw

11

businesses or they are trying to get some economic

12

development going, they are not interested in more

13

or less how the housing project is right now.

14

may be interested in doing infrastructure projects.

15

Are we talking to them?

16
17

They

Or are we

making those decisions here?
MR. BREWER:

We are talking to the

18

communities that you have mentioned practically on a

19

daily, if not weekly, basis.

20

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Your conversations with

21

them and my conversations with them are totally

22

different.

23
24

MR. BREWER:

Let me try to be clear.

This

goes far beyond the desires of a municipality and
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 31

1

our desire to fund the deals.

It goes into whether

2

or not we have got proper engineering.

3

whether or not you can successfully complete a

4

project.

It goes into

There a number of things.
We have, again, dollars awarded to

5

projects in communities that have not started, that

7

have languished for a time.

8

9

provided consultants to work with those communities.

We have gone in and
We have

10

Again, we are trying to keep from having funds

11

languish unspent, to try to apply them to work that

12

can get done.
That is so we can continue to move

13
14

forward.

15

of both time and dollars in the communities that you

16

mentioned for a host of those very needed projects.

17

We can give you a very detailed report.

18

But we have spent an extraordinary amount

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

I would like to see the

19

infrastructure projects and I think this Board would

20

like to see the infrastructure projects that have

21

been done.

22

MR. BREWER:

23

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

24

No problem.
Because what I have

been told by my Mayors, and my municipalities, is
________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 32

1

that none of them got any CDBG funding, only one.
MR. JASSO:

2
3

We will be happy to provide

that to you.

I have a similar

problem with funding of these social services.

8

donations.

9

They get money.

10

They

They get private

They get money from the government.
So us doing that with the CDBG

block grant I don't think is a good idea.
I don't know if you need a petition

11
12

from this Board to HUD.

What has to be done?

That

13

money should be used in the various municipalities

14

for infrastructure and for building.

15

three folks in my District that were awarded CDBG

16

block grant funds.

17

the money was coming, and that was reversed.

then after the fact they were telling them no it was

not going to be granted this year.

they said that there will be money for them next

Why that would

It was

We have other areas in our budget

where we are giving money to all of these social

services.

4

that have traditionally been used for infrastructure

for buildings, for working in the municipalities for

6

things they consider they need, I think to change

7

that at this date when the need is greater is not a

8

good thing.

To come out of the CDBG block grant funds

9

How do we go about talking to whoever

10

we need to talk to about getting this changed back?

Is there a law now that we must give to social

services?

Once again, I won't speak to

enough to speak to the past.

traditionally there is traditional use of CDBG in

to that -- but in terms of CDBG nationally.

The vast preponderance has to be

8

highway dollars are utilized for infrastructure.

9

Yet it reached the limitation where local dollars

10

IDE/CDBG have to be utilized to help create some

11

catalyst development.

12

We

We are trying to do that.

We have to think much more

13

holistically about our investments in

14

infrastructure.

15

do know that there is lots of needs out there for

public dollars, both for infrastructure and for

social services and community development.

trying to balance that.

at in terms of doing this.

20

from the need and the very unmet need of

infrastructure that exists far beyond the means of

So it is very much in the norm.

I also want to point out --

the decisions that are brought for funding went

through our Community Advisory Development

basis surrounding the allocations.

several south suburban Mayors who sit on that board,

who have overseen and directed around this award

allocation.

There are

This has gone through a fairly robust

10

review, both with the elected officials and citizens

11

in all parts of suburban Cook County.
Also I should point out that there was

12
13

a statement made:

Does this have anything to do

with the City?

15

with the City of Chicago in our decision-making

to small business enterprises throughout the County.

21

That will allow them to do business-related things,

such as equipment purchases, etcetera, which would

create jobs and add jobs.

to give us, in this County, money as they do in

I need to ask this

question before I forget.
Are you guaranteeing the loan or are
you providing the loan?
MR. JASSO:

It is a loan guarantee that is

provided typically through a third party.

But it is

what you are doing is huge.

9

you have so many parts to it.

I know

It is so diverse and
It is confusing

10

because we don't really know what is happening and

why certain things are happening.

I know there is going to be an

grants that they were told they were going to get,

accommodation for them next year.

There will be some

I think keeping us informed so that

when we get the phone calls we can give an answer to

our constituents, that this is why it happened --

and I did, after talking to Herman -- thank you very

21

much -- I did have a reason for them, and then they

are not as angry and upset as they were when they

COMMISSIONER STEELE:

Commissioner Steele.
Herman, with some of

6

the recent changes in staffing in the department,

7

how are we going to be able to meet some of the

8

needs we have in the program areas that we have lost

9

the staff, in some of the CDBG areas that you had on

10

board?
MR. BREWER:

11

Sure.

We have had significant

12

reduction in staff, particularly in our Planning and

13

Development area.

14

have looked to target more dollars to go out the

That has -- in some respects, we

We have underwriting spreadsheets.

We have staff

that has been trained on how to more efficiently and

effectively handle the process, both allocations and

grants and loan monitoring.

staff, but we have a higher skill set being applied

24

to the work.

We have got many fewer

________________________________________________
ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

 43

COMMISSIONER STEELE:

1

So even with the

2

higher skill set, and with the implementation of the

3

grants that we have talked about today, about the

4

lag in time, is that going to be able to keep us on

5

track with the loss of that staff?
MR. BREWER:

6

Yes.

In fact, with the

7

reductions that we have had -- when I came on board,

8

we had seventy-five FTEs in that one department.

9

are down to somewhere around thirty-five or forty.

10

We have quadrupled our production in

COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

Thank you, Mr.

Mr. Brewer, earlier this year we used

8
9

Commissioner Suffredin:

some of our revenue bond tax caps to issue some

10

bonds.

It was the first time we have done it in a

11

number of years.

12

Do you see that as a tool that we will

13

be able to use to help businesses and not-for-profit

14

ventures who don't have access to some of the

15

financial markets?

16

MR. BREWER:

Absolutely -- you are speaking

17

to the private activity bond.

18

million worth of that for Cook County for this year.

19

That is the first time we have secured that since

20

2002, I believe.

21

roughly that amount each succeeding year.

22

go after it as aggressively as we did this year.

23

The first deal we did, that the Board voted on

24

recently, was the $4.5 million deal.

We did secure $10

available to us for supportive housing, housing for

3

people with disabilities, the elderly, and the like.
COMMISSIONER SUFFREDIN:

4

One of the things

5

that we have been hearing a little bit here.

I

6

don't want to get into the regional distribution.

7

Various tools have greater impact in certain parts

8

of the County than others.

9

with some of the communities that I especially

I think sitting down

10

represent, and talking about if there are ways to do

11

joint ventures and to use the bond program; that may

12

be a way for us to get involved in homeless shelters

13

and affordable housing issues that are a little bit

14

different in the northern end of the County than

15

they are in the southern end.

16

I think there is probably

17

receptiveness from the governments, even though they

18

are all home rule governments, so we don't get into

19

the CDBG money.

20

to them.

21

we need to show is that we are reaching out and

22

there is a distribution of issues.

keep that in the back of your mind.

As we look at the 6Bs and

ANTHONY W. LISANTI - (312) 405-1383

appreciate the question.
We are really working hard to sort of

2
3

try and reduce, if not eliminate, that sort of zero-

4

sum game that is applied.

5

sort of games being played when I worked at the

6

local municipal level, where we had firms shopping

7

bids back and forth between municipalities.
There are, as you mentioned in the

8

I recall seeing those

beginning, some eligibility issues relative to

10

census tract and demographic numbers with grant

11

dollars and the like; the sort of distribution of

12

resources.

13

I think we are very fortunate here in

14

the discussions that we have been having with

15

municipalities all across the County -- south, west,

16

and northwest, in particular, which has led to us

17

expanding, for example, the home consortium to

18

include a number of the other municipalities, the

northwest, and southwest.

said to Commissioner Steele, in terms of the skill

set and experience in looking at these kinds of

requests.
We can look in more detail as to where

5

they are coming from, whether they are expanding to

another site as opposed to leaving one site for the

other, and whether there is a net gain.
We have been aided with this sort of

review by EDAC, the Economic Development Advisory

Committee, which is a cross-section of private

12

sector folks, municipal leaders, civic leaders, and

13

others to help advise staff around these kinds of

things.

Herman, in the vein of some of the

15

questions raised by previous speakers related to

CDBG funding, to what degree has the shrinking pot

of Federal dollars flowing to the County made it

more challenging for you to choose between

infrastructure, hard projects, so to speak, and

human services-related types of funding?

COMMISSIONER GARCIA:

With the reality of a

11

shrinking Federal pot of money from CDBG sources, a

12

part of what we have got to do in Cook County,

13

particularly in the south suburbs, and possibly in

14

the western suburbs, perhaps to a lesser degree, is

15

to partner with business and with industry.

16

To that degree, one of the great

17

promises for the Southland is the development of the

18

CNN rail yard as a hub and an economic development

19

engine for the region.

20

Can you talk a little bit about how we

21

are looking to help that move forward and connect

many of the suburban communities there to that

potential economic engine as it relates to the

I think the point that Commissioner

Suffredin brought up a bit earlier about people

11

moving from one site to another, within their very

near locale, is a big concern.

13

situation is also a little more complex because all

of these people are going to tell you that if they

15

don't get this, they are going to move out of the

County where there would be a net loss.

17

that's one of their arguments for saying they are

moving here -- if you don't give me this, I am going

to move out of the County.

helped to expand the 6B and come up with a couple of

new proposals in the County to create a more level

MR. BREWER:

Eight.

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

Eight of them -- the

grant that they were funded under no longer exists;

is that what you are saying?
MR. BREWER:

One of no longer exists.

That

was the Neighborhood Stabilization program which is

gone.

mentioned the significant reduction in the community

And reductions in the HOME funds.

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

MR. BREWER:

They are revenue funds, not

grant-related.

The new people that you

are hiring will strictly be corporate?

We also

Not grant-related?

I

guess that answers that question.
My other question is -- did you know

16
17

that you don't have to use your fifteen percent for

18

social services?

19

CDBG?
MR. BREWER:

20
21

That you could use it all for

It is all CDBG funds as the

source.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

22

You can use it for

23

infrastructure as opposed to using it for social

24

services.

You don't have to use up the fifteen

That is correct.

In some cases, we have in

how that was done to each of the Commissioners.

18

Our staff deployed a fairly robust set

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

We will

Here is what I would

19

like for you guys to do.

Leave the CDBG dollars

20

strictly for infrastructure and find another path

21

for social service agencies so that you have

look for more grants to move that part out of I

past.
MR. BREWER:

Then in moving forward they would

I will take that under

consideration.
COMMISSIONER SIMS:

7

I mean, really take it

8

under consideration; not just tell me that because I

9

am sitting here.
MR. BREWER:

10

I will have the staff float

11

your idea with the Federal Government

12

representatives.

13

COMMISSIONER SIMS:

14

Washington, so I know you can do it.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

15

I just called

Commissioner, those

agencies that will be funded, are you suggesting

that they not be funded; the social agencies?

Where would they find the

We are going after more grants.

But until we get those

No.

I just wanted us

to look for more dollars someplace else.
CHAIRMAN DALEY:

10

But they are Federal cuts.

11

They are cutting at the Federal level.

12

when you attend the various meetings, and they

at some other options.
