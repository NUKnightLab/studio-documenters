RE: DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES FLOW OF FUNDS
I am assigning LPD to work with DEGC to provide the report requested below.

Over the last four decades, the City of Detroit has approved numerous tax abatements and
development incentives. City Council on several instances has been questioned by the
community and Detroit Public Schools Community District on how these
incentives impact the ?nancial position of and Detroit Public Schools (DPS old).
A non-inclusive list of development incentives that capture these millages are:

PA 376 of 1996 Renaissance Zone

PA 146 of 2000 OPRA

PA 210 of 2005 Commercial Rehabilitation
Etc.



Staff has continued to indicate, as per state law, that and DPS are made whole
and not adversely impacted by the capture of operating and debt millages. Despite these
assurances continues to express its concern about the ?nancial harm caused by
the capture of these mills. Please provide a chart that identi?es the ?ow of funds from
the capture of the mills at the municipal level to the reimbursement of lost mills to
at the state level. In addition, provide proof of reimbursement to and
DPS from all mills captured.

Please provide this response by 15 November 2018. If you have any questions please do
not hesitate to contact my of?ce at, 313?224-1198.
