The Secretary called upon the following registered public speakers:
1. George Blakemore
2. Lonnell Saffold

Concerned Citizen
Director of Institutional Services, SEIU Local 1

Board Chairman Carvalho noted that when issues are brought forth during the provision of public testimony that
ought to be addressed, the usual practice is that someone in the administration provides a response as soon as the
matter has been investigated or reviewed. During his testimony, Mr. Saffold described an issue in which he alleged
that a current vendor has been non-compliant with its contractual obligations. Mr. Saffold testified at the August
9th Board Meeting on the same issue; Board Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the administration had completed
their review of the matter. Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, responded that the administration is aware of
the matter and they are addressing it; a response will be provided when review of the matter is completed1.

III. Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Committee’s
consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
With regard to the suggestions made at the August 9th Board Meeting for possible revisions to the transmittal
template, in order to include additional information and data, Ms. Besenhofer stated that a small committee
will be set up to work on this matter; she anticipates that the work should be completed in time for the October
meeting.
During the Committee’s review of the requests, discussion took place regarding nurse staffing, in relation to
request number 1 (request for commercial nurse agency services). Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief
Nursing Officer provided further information. She stated that there were a significant number of retirements in
December of last year; the administration was unable at that time to fully staff the nursing units, so some of the
nursing units were closed as a result. As new employees have been hired, the administration has also
supplemented with agency personnel, especially in hard-to-fill specialty positions. Ms. Russell stated that
recruiting efforts continue, but it has been challenging. In January, seventy-seven (77) critical nursing
positions were identified; recruiting and hiring for those positions is now being concluded. She added that the
System is losing approximately two (2) nursing staff every week, so those positions will need to be filled, as
well. With regard to the reason for the contract increase, Ms. Russell stated that the contract increase is
directly tied to the vacancy rate.
With regard to request number 4, Director Michael noted that this is a revenue generating contract; however,
he inquired whether there was a cost to the System associated with the contract. Ms. Besenhofer responded
affirmatively; she stated that, depending on the type of the request, it could be $3.00 or $5.00 per record.
Director Velasquez, seconded by Director Michael, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 4, under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
LaVerne Hall, Director of the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance, provided a report (Attachment #2)
regarding the review by Contract Compliance of the four contractual requests. The Committee reviewed the
information.

C. Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items
There were no Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items for the Committee to consider.
D. Approval of Transfer of Funds requests
There were no Transfer of Funds requests for the Committee to consider.

E. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Notification of Emergency Purchases (Attachment #3)
The Secretary indicated that a Notification of Emergency Purchase was received that morning. Electronic
copies of this Notification will be sent to the Committee Members following this meeting, and will be included
in the record.

B. Financial Reports through June July 2012 (Attachment #4)
Dorothy Loving, System Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports through July 2012.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Michael, seconded by Director Golden, moved to accept the Financial Reports
through July 2012. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Introduction of CCHHS FY2013 Preliminary Budget (Attachment #5)
Chairman O’Donnell indicated that the Committee will review and discuss the budget materials at this time;
the CCHHS FY2013 Preliminary Budget is expected to be considered for approval at the System Board
Meeting on September 5th.
Public hearings will be held on the Preliminary Budget by the Finance Committee. Dates, times and locations
of the public hearings are as follows:
Tuesday, August 28, 2012 at 7:30 A.M.

1900 W. Polk Street, 2nd Floor Conference Room
Chicago, Illinois

Thursday, August 30, 2012 at 6:00 P.M.

1900 W. Polk Street, 2nd Floor Conference Room
Chicago, Illinois

Tuesday, September 4, 2012 at 9:00 A.M.

118 North Clark Street, Room 567
Cook County Building
Chicago, Illinois

In addition to providing a mechanism on the System’s website allowing the public to view the budget materials
and register in advance to provide testimony at a public hearing, the System’s website will also provide a
mechanism for the public to electronically provide their testimony directly to the Board, via the Secretary.
This mechanism will provide a convenient method for those members of the public who cannot attend a
hearing to share their comments on the Preliminary Budget with the System Board.
Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, and John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, introduced the
CCHHS FY2013 Preliminary Budget and related materials. Dr. Raju provided an overview of the materials.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Committee discussed the subject of the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver. Dr. Raju noted that this budget
begins December 1; a decision or approval of the Waiver by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) could take place prior to or after December 1, which affects the projected revenue estimates for the
budget.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
C. Introduction of CCHHS FY2013 Preliminary Budget (continued)
The Committee discussed the following subjects: payer mix; expedited hiring process for Section 1115
Medicaid Waiver positions; chargeback of expenses associated with the Waiver population; and budgeting for
expenses related to productivity, communication and tracking of patients within the Waiver population.
Board Chairman Carvalho provided an overview of the process used last year in budgeting and funding vacant
positions. A large number of vacant positions were funded at twenty percent (20%); at the time, it was thought
to be an easier process and would provide more flexibility in filling vacancies, rather than using the process of
taking a smaller pool and reclassifying a position in order to transform that vacancy into a different vacancy.
He stated that, now that the System has a better rapport with County processes, it was determined that the
System would budget for the positions that are needed, with 100% funding. If a need arises, staff can process a
reclassification to get a job title closer to what is needed.
Following the Committee’s discussion, Chairman O’Donnell requested that the Committee receive regular
updates at each meeting on the implementation schedule and timeline for critical projects that impact the
budget; these projects include the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver; the implementation of the GHX contract
management/electronic data exchange system in Supply Chain Management; and Meaningful Use2.
Board Chairman Carvalho reminded the Committee members that at the August 9th Board Meeting, a request
was made for an update to be provided to the Finance Committee sometime in the near future on Information
Technology operations and impact of the Shared Services amendment that was approved by the Cook County
Board during their FY2012 Budget deliberations3.
Additionally, Chairman O’Donnell requested that a Board/Committee Education presentation with an
overview on the subject of how the County is financed be provided at a Finance Committee Meeting in the
near future4.

As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman O’Donnell declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended July 31, 2012. This discussion focuses on
the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month. It
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide primary,
intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to
pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy
activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the eight months with overall
revenue of $561,778 and overall expenses was $617,174.
Net Patient revenue for the eight months was $360,377.
5
Page 27 of 95

 Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $4,358. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2011, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
July-2012 remained the same at 154 days. The 7 day increase in this figure, as compared
to June-2012 figure, is due largely to the one-time or first-time occurrence of the
following factors:




Movement of accounts with undeliverable addresses to the collection agency;
Correction of pharmacy charging issues; and
Transition of patients previously covered under the LOL program to the Carelink
program.

Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $4.797M (1.4%) as compared to the November-2011
balance, but fell by $10.662M (2.9%) as compared to the prior month’s balance. The
decrease in this balance continues the six (6) month trend of this figure’s decline. This
indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the collection process.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.
6
Page 28 of 95

 Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of July-2012 decreased by
$6.058M (28.6%) as compared the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is greater
than the previous month’s balance by $1.591M (11.8%) as well. This indicates that less
inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual cash
collections.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of July-2012 increased by $2.264M (1.2%). This
amount is less than the previous month’s balance by $3.320M (1.7%). This decrease also
decreased CCHHS’ days in revenue outstanding.
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that accounts are being removed from active
accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad debt
write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $2.954M (13.2%) by the end of
July-2012, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2011. This
month’s balance increased by $3.805M (17.7%). Fewer outpatient accounts are moving
to a “Billed” status, as compared to the November-2011, and there was a growth in the
outpatient unbilled accounts during the month of July-2012. The reduction of internal
bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a decline in the unbilled accounts
receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts

7
Page 29 of 95

 The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of July-2012 rose by $2.533M (1.6%)
over the balance as of November 30, 2011. This figure is smaller than the previous
month’s balance by $7.342M (4.3%).
The reduction in this figure, as compared to the prior month’s balance, indicates a greater
number of Out-Patient accounts had their collection and write-off related activities
completed.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.
Carelink Program Activities (Charity Care)

Operating Expenses at the end of eight months was $617.174M broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $317.225M
Benefits - $95.305M
Supplies - $65.388M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $89.302M
Depreciation - $22.422M
Utilities - $6.580M
Insurance - $20.953M
Nonoperating Revenue was $197.043M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
sales tax in the amount of $82.352M and property tax in the amount of $53.285M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois 8
Page 30 of 95

 Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

OFHC had negative Medicare revenue for the month due to a Medicare RAC audit.
The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 06/20/2012 - 07/11/2012 .
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" total is a payment to the state for supplemental workers
hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Upper Payment Limit Revision is spread over 11 months, beginning Jan-2012, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received.
The "Medicaid Retroactive Payment" was budgeted all at SHCC.
Please see the notes re: the FY2012 budget, located on the final budget tab.
