The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 948-954 W. Fulton Market
27th Ward
Proposed Fulton-Randolph Market District
Proposed one-story rooftop addition, outdoor deck, cabanas and metal screen.
Action:

Approved unanimously (vote was 3-0 with Commissioner Wong recusing)
with the following conditions:

1. The location, scale, size, design and materials of the proposed rooftop addition
approved as shown on plans dated December 12, 2014. As proposed, the
color of the various materials should be generally uniform; and,
2. As proposed, plantings shall be low growth with no tall shrubs or trees.
2. 830 – 1200 West Fulton Market Streetscape
27th Ward
Proposed Fulton-Randolph Market District
Proposed geometric (grading, sidewalk elevations, etc.) changes to Fulton Market
Street from Green Street to Racine Street.
Action:

The Committee adopted unanimously (vote was 3-0 with Commissioner
Wong recusing) the following findings:

 I. Preliminarily adopted, for the purposes of permit review, the ‘Streetscape’
section of the Fulton-Randolph Market District Design Guidelines (draft dated
November 21, 2014);
II. Found that the conceptual modifications to street geometry, grading and the
ground plane for Fulton Market Street within the boundary of the proposed
district, with the following conditions, meet the criteria set forth in the
Commission’s Rules and Regulations, the Commission’s Guidelines for
Alterations to Historic Buildings and New Construction, the U.S. Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings, and the draft
Fulton-Randolph Market District Guidelines and therefore, the project will
not have an adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural
features of the proposed landmark district and approved the project with the
following conditions:
1. As proposed, the raised sidewalk loading docks in all existing
locations shall be maintained, repaired or rebuilt to current elevations
but modified as needed to provide accessibility. Enlarged plans of all
individual raised sidewalk locations with proposed modifications as
well as key elevations showing railings, which should maintain an
industrial aesthetic that is transparent and minimal in design to allow
for views to the adjacent building façade, shall be submitted for
Committee review and approval as part of the next submittal and prior
to installation;
2. Enlarged plans and elevations of all proposed bumpout locations,
including proposed paving materials, should be submitted for
Committee review and approval as part of the next submittal and prior
to installation;
3. Enlarged plans and sections of the four raised intersections, including
proposed materials, should be submitted for Committee review and
approval as part of the next submittal and prior to installation;
4. Paving patterns and colors have a significant impact on the historic
character of the proposed district and should be compatible with the
historic district. Historically, Belgian-block paving was prevalent
throughout the area (currently it is visible in certain sections of alleys)
and paving of a pattern and color consistent with the historic block
paving is recommended. Further details and material samples should
be provided for the Committee review and approval as part of the next
submittal and prior to installation;
5. The existing significant features (sidewalks, reduced-height streetlevel sidewalks, raised sidewalk loading docks, etc.) on side streets, to
the extent that they will be included in the streetscape scope of work,
shall be maintained. Proposed plans showing modifications to side
street geometry, grading and the ground plane as well as enlarged
plans and key elevations of proposed raised sidewalk loading dock
conditions shall be submitted for Committee review and approval as
part of the next submittal and prior to installation;
6. As proposed and as the project develops, additional elements of the
streetscape, including elements such as railings, bollards/vertical
identifiers/signs, street lighting, and landscaping, etc., will be

 presented to the Committee for review and a decision at a future
meeting; and,
7. The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the
Department of Planning and Development, shall reach out to and meet
with all property owners impacted by the streetscape project prior to
the next project presentation to the Committee.
3. 410 W. Webster
43rd Ward
Mid-North District
Proposed new 1-story rear addition for 1-car garage, stair, and rooftop deck to
existing 2-story townhouse.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. As proposed, the common brick proposed for the rear addition shall match the
common brick of the west façade of the townhouse in size, profile, color, and
texture and the new mortar shall match the mortar of the townhouse in color
and joint profile;
2. The downspout, proposed to be installed on the west façade of the historic
building, shall be relocated to be attached to the rear addition instead;
3. Cut-sheets of the garage door, proposed to incorporate recessed paneling, and
the man door shall be provided as part of the permit application; and,
4. The project as proposed would require a zoning adjustment/variation to reduce
the side yard setback. The Commission takes no position regarding any
requested variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code requirements.

4. 4858 S. Kenwood (The Blossom House)
4th Ward
Kenwood District
Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation of single-family residence including
repair and reconstruction of deteriorated porches, a new 1-story rear addition, a new
fence in the rear yard, and repairs to the carriage house.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

Main House:
1. As proposed, the two deteriorated historic open porches may be dismantled
and rebuilt to match the historic design. Any columns and railings that can be
salvaged shall be reused and those that are beyond repair shall be replicated
in-kind as proposed;
2. Areas of spot in-kind replacement of the wood siding shall be confirmed by
Historic Preservation staff prior to work occurring;
3. The top of the new fence proposed in the rear yard may be no taller than 6’
from grade and may be constructed of painted or stained wood or open metal.
The fence shall not be attached to the house or carriage house and a gap of at
least 2” shall be provided. Elevation drawings shall be included in the permit
plans;
4. The new rear 1-story addition and raised deck is approved as proposed;

 Carriage House:
5. The new overhead sectional, motorized garage door shall replicate the original
carriage doors in design as proposed. Enlarged details shall be included in the
permit plans;
6. Replacement roofing and framing may be installed as necessary and new
gutters and downspouts shall match the historic profiles and shapes. Enlarged
details shall be included in the permit plans; and,
Sample Review:
7. All new mortar shall match historic mortar in size, profile, texture, and
type/strength. Any new bricks shall match the historic roman bricks in size,
color, texture, and finish. Any new limestone shall match the historic
