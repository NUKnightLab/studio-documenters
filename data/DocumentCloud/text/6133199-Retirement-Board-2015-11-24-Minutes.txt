Heather Jackson from the law form of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister appeared before the Board on a
proposed settlement agreement between the City of Chicago, Policemen’s Annuity & Benefit Fund
and the Department of Justice. The proposed agreement is in furtherance of a settlement that is
anticipated in a case that challenged the police department's hiring, the residency requirement that was in
place until 2011. As part of the settlement, eight class members will be hired and the settlement also
provides for retroactive seniority to those hired class members, both in terms of pension benefits and in
terms of pay. Specifically, those eight class members can elect a seniority date between July 1st, 2008,
and their actual date of hire. The City would agree to fund the employer's side of the pension obligation
as well as the interest, and the hired individual would have the obligation to pay the employee's side. The
member, once hired, would have the lesser of five years or his or her retirement date to fund his or her
retroactive seniority date.
It was requested of the Fund to approve the settlement as presented, awarding a back-pay award, sonority
and pension credit. The Board provided direction to the Fund’s staff to sign the settlement.
All business concluded for this date, it was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Hamburger
that this meeting be adjourned.
