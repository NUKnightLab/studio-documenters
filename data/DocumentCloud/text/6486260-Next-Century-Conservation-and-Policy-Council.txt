Commissioner Stanley Moore, Maria Pesqueira and Shelley Spencer did not attend.
Commissioner Donna Miller and Michelle Harris from her staff attended. Cicely Fleming and Michelle Jordan from
Commissioner Suffredin’s office attended. Representatives from the Chicago Botanic Garden, the Chicago
Zoological Society, Friends of the Forest Preserve, Openlands, the Forest Preserves Foundation, and the
Metropolitan Planning Council also attended.

Call to order and welcome. Wendy Paulson called the meeting to order at 8:45 a.m. and introduced Forest
Preserves Board Commissioner Donna Miller. Commissioner Miller welcomed the Council to Camp Sullivan and
thanked the Council, advocates, and staff for their work to promote the Forest Preserves. Commissioner Miller is
also promoting the preserves throughout her district. She recently hosted 30 women for a cookout and camping
at Camp Sullivan to introduce them to the Forest Preserves.
Wendy explained that the purpose of the retreat is to discuss the position papers the Council is working on.
“Everybody on the Council has put a lot of time in on this. Staff has put a lot of time in and we have a number of
partners who have been helping us. We welcome all of you today. These sessions are designed to be an
opportunity for very frank feedback. I know there have been frustrations and some confusion. We shouldn’t get
ourselves too strung out about these papers. We have imposed deadlines but if we need more time, we will take
more time.”
Wendy explained that the discussions have surfaced tensions and disagreements; adding that this is okay and the
Council really wants to address these issues. The Council hopes the position papers will be thoughtful and express
as well as possible a unanimous or nearly unanimous view.

Public Comment. Shelley Davis from the FP Foundation invited all participants to attend the Foundation’s Spring
Forum on June 14. Laurel Ross attended last year and said it was a fantastic event.

 Approval of minutes. A motion was made by Mark Templeton, seconded by Laurel Ross, to approve minutes
from the meeting of April 15, 2019. The minutes were approved.

Stories. Beti Guevara from the Union League Boys and Girls Club explained that many residents from Chicago’s
Humboldt Park community have never visited the forest preserves and are uncomfortable out in nature. Beti’s
mission is to bring these families to the Forest Preserves and show them how to enjoy nature. She also believes
that the increasing diversity at the Forest Preserves is making her community feel more welcome. She explained,
“I am making sure that Humboldt park comes here because I see a change. There are so many people from
different backgrounds. This is tremendous what they have done.”
Amy Boerman-Cornell teaches fourth grade at Calvin Christian School, just a few miles from Camp Sullivan. She
takes her fourth graders and their families to Camp Sullivan. “I want them to see the outdoors as enjoyable—not
scary,” she explained. To make camping an easy and affordable option for the students and their families, Amy
uses FPCC’s gear library. Amy explains that “by taking away the need for them to have to bring all their own
supplies, camping becomes a real option for them.” Amy ended with the following “wish list”:
▪

Would love to have night
hikes on more Friday nights.

▪

Would love to stay 2 days.

▪

Want more moms to use the
climbing wall. (They almost
never do.)

▪

Expand climbing wall times.

▪

More camping locations.

Breakout Sessions 1 and 2.

The first breakout session focused on scaling up volunteers, and land
acquisition/disposition.
The second breakout sessions focused on compatible recreation and land
acquisition/disposition. Summaries of all breakout sessions are presented in Attachment B.

Updates from Superintendent Arnold Randall and Delio Calzolari, Director of Legislative Affairs. Delio
and Arnold presented the following updates.
▪

State Capital Bill. Delio presented an overview of the capital bill recently approved by the state legislature.
The bill includes $33B for transportation projects, $3.5B for education, $4.3B for state facilities, $1.9B for
economic/community development, $1B for healthcare/human services/broadband, and $1.2B for
environmental and conservation projects. The FPCC, the Zoo and the Garden worked together to seek funding
within the capital bill for urgent capital needs; unfortunately, these efforts were mostly unsuccessful. (FPCC
did receive $225K for the Burnham golf course and repairs of Swallow Cliff stairs; the Garden received $100K
for capital improvements.) However, we will be able to apply for grants from IDNR, DCEO, and other state
agencies that will receive funding from the capital bill. Chip O’Leary added that John Rogers, the former chair
of Chicago Wilderness, will be the new Deputy Director at IDNR and John is a huge supporter of the forest
preserves.

▪

Referendum. Delio explained that the FPCC, Zoo and Garden are working with the Friends of the Forest
Preserves and Openlands to pursue a referendum in March 2020 or November 2020. The Trust for Public
Lands is initiating a new round of polling to test likely voter support for additional revenue for the FPCC, Zoo
and Garden.

Council members and participants discussed the following:
▪

What will it cost to run a campaign? If the polling shows high support, little campaigning is needed. If a full
campaign is needed, it could cost $1 million.

2

 ▪

How would the money be spent? How will we find the funding? We know we need to build the community
of support to understand what the preserves are. What we have done is great, but it is just the tip of the
iceberg.

▪

We will also have to explore what happens if we do not get more revenue. We will be developing scenarios
for where we cut programs and services. People need to understand what they will lose if we do nothing, but
we also need to talk about it in a way that doesn’t create fear and chaos. This will be a delicate message to
balance.

▪

What amounts are being considered? Several scenarios are being explored—including a 20-year capital bond
and an increase above the current property limiting rate. For the various options being explored, the cost to
the average homeowner ranged from $4 per year to $20+ per year.

▪

Arnold explained that efforts are gearing up and key partners are at the table. There is a path forward; it may
not be an easy path, but we feel strongly we need to make the effort.

▪

The primary is shockingly close. Can we be ready? Because the governor is asking voters to approve a
graduated income tax during the general election, it may (or may not) be better to run a referendum during
the primary.

▪

We must be ready to mobilize.

▪

What’s going on with Quentin Road? Arnold explained that the Department of County Highways is completing
its analysis. We are not ready to make a recommendation to the President and Board, but expect to do so by
end of year.

Breakout Session 3. The final breakout session focused on racial equity. (Compatible recreation did not convene
a breakout group in the afternoon.) Summaries of all breakout sessions are presented in Attachment B.

Wrap-up & Next Steps. Mark Templeton explained that the position paper committees are at different places
along the journey. All groups will take the feedback from this workshop, assess where they are, and decide how
long they need to complete their draft papers. Mark reiterated that it is important to get this right and we should
take the time we need to do that. Once the drafts are completed, we will need a process to get the full Council
to adopt the position papers.
The next step will be to take the papers to the President and Commissioners and ask them to adopt the position
papers. Mark asked the Council to think about any other actions they will ask the board to take (such as adopting
ordinances, etc.) to ensure the papers get implemented.
Mark asked participants to provide feedback on the day; participants offered the following comments:
▪

For breakout groups, it would be good to write down ideas and tell participants, “We want your feedback and
we will incorporate it.” (Note: Flip charts were available for each breakout session and a note-taker attended
each session to document input. The summaries are presented in Attachment B.)

▪

If we want to drive a specific result—more funding to achieve goals—it would be great to adjust the workshop
agenda and format to have a laser focus on the outcome we are trying to achieve.

3

 ▪

I came today to see if this resonated with the discussions of the position paper working groups. What I found
was the conversation enriched our work. It ended up not being just a “check-off” day; it was enormously rich.
That was a great outcome.

▪

It would be great to use some of the workshop time to talk about next year’s budget. And we should think
about how the input from today will impact the upcoming budget.

▪

I didn’t know that there was so much back-up data available from the NCCP planning process.

▪

I am not really sure what the FPCC should do next in terms of engaging the public. We may need a follow-up
session on community engagement.

▪

PRI used mixed-methods to get input for the Natural and Cultural Resources Master Plan. This is also a
resource that is out there.

▪

We need to make sure that REDI efforts are complementary and coordinated. We are talking about this in
lots of different ways.

▪

Before we finalize the papers, we need to make sure they are cohesive and consistent with existing policies.

▪

We don’t have a hard deadline; maybe we need to have one session of representative stakeholders that will
be impacted by these position papers to get their feedback on key findings.

Participants also offered comments related to logistics and scope, including:
▪

Check microphones prior to meeting.

▪

Provide a vegetarian option for lunch.

▪

Because the papers are limited to a few pages, we need a way to capture all this input so it doesn’t get lost.

▪

I wish I could have gone to the breakout discussions for all four position papers.

▪

We could all benefit from a deeper dive on REDI; we could have done ½ a day on REDI alone.

Mark reminded everyone that the final meeting for the year will be held on September 23. At that meeting, the
Council will review the status of implementation efforts, approve its annual report, and formulate its
recommendation on FPCC’s 2020 budget.

Adjournment. Emily moved to adjourn; Terry seconded the motion. The meeting was adjourned at 2:42 pm.

Proposed Position
Statement

 

  
   
  

The Forest Preserves of Cook County should
increase the amount of land protected in Cook
County both by acquiring more land and by
influencing protection by others, to realize the
people and Nature goals of the Next Century
Conservation Plan.

in alignment with its mission, it should prioritize
opportunities and expand existing strategies.
including taking a lead role on identifying locations
for collaboration.

The disposition of land should be considered only in

extreme instances.

Provide case studies and best practices that demonstrate successful strategies
Suggest specific actions to expand volunteer involvement and contribution, e.g. strategic partnerships
with groups that have successful volunteer programs
Are these the right goals? Where could we do better? What’s missing?

Resolving tensions
Our position states that: Volunteers should be integrated broadly throughout the Cook County Forest Preserves
organization. Forest Preserves staff is a critical audience affecting our efforts. While we are convinced that wider
volunteer involvement will help forge a stronger, more effective organization, as well as advance the Next Century
Conservation Plan. We also recognize that there may be internal reservations about some of the
recommendations. We want and need support from the staff for our proposals. What will help us attain unified
support for this position paper?
Council members most likely have had their own professional experiences dealing with tensions in their
workplaces over issues that needed unified support. Sharing those experiences with us – especially what
approaches to resolving tensions were tried, what worked, and what didn’t work – would help us.

 Attachment B – Breakout Session Discussion Summaries
Compatible Recreation (Breakout Session 2)
Terry Guen and Mike DeSantiago presented an overview of the committee’s preliminary recommendations. (See
Attachment A for full presentation.) Terry asked participants for feedback. The following issues were discussed:
•

•

Slide 1A: Definition:
o

Reminder of the 80/20 rule. Benjamin stated that the current breakdown is closer to 85%
undeveloped/15% developed.

o

The definition aligns with mission, scope, NCCP, etc.

o

Is there a strategy of inclusion? How are you defining impacted community? Mike responded that
inclusion is incorporated into the evaluation criteria.

o

How does climate resiliency play into this? How do you incorporate being welcoming and inclusive?

o

How do we encourage greater participation among people who do outdoor recreation? How do we
engage people who don’t come to the forest preserves and show them this serves their interests?

o

Once you acquire land, will you develop the appropriate recreational activities based on community
interests?

Other slides:
o

What is criteria for scoring and weighing? Is there a range of scores that indicate an option is
acceptable? Eileen Figel responded that the evaluation matrix focuses on the costs and benefits of
each option, then compares results of different options for each site. For example, what are the costs
and benefits to keep pool A open versus to close pool A and repurpose the site? Karen Vaughan added
that we need to make sure we have the right people in the room during this process—including those
from impacted communities so they have input into the evaluation process and help bring legitimacy
to the proposals. Carl Vogel warned that we cannot make this solely about numbers. We should be
clear with audiences that this is a good process for evaluation, but the score is not the end.

o

I am confused about the scoring of community impact. The language should be clearer in terms of
equity/inclusion. Does the weighing make sense?

o

How do the summary scores resulting from the preliminary analysis align with the definition of
compatible recreation? Did you assume all existing facilities are compatible because they exist?
Shouldn’t we ask first whether the FPCC should operate pools? Can you adjust the weighted attributes
to really assess whether a use is consistent with the definition of compatible recreation? Eileen
responded that the process does not assume existing uses are compatible. In fact, the existing process
recommends closing pools unless they can be positioned to complement FPCC programs or facilities
which are clearly aligned with its mission. (For example, Green Lake pool is being incorporated into a
nature campus as an amenity to the adjacent campground and nature center.)

o

A public engagement process will be important to Commissioners.

o

You need to listen to your customers, but you can’t allow community input to drive inappropriate
business decisions.

o

You also need to recognize that communities may come to this from very different perspectives. Their
priority may not be protecting nature.

23

 o

It is important to hold genuine public stakeholder meetings and sincerely seek input. Otherwise it is
a waste of the community’s time.

o

It is also important to have broad participation and to consider long-term impacts to a community.
For example, what if we close a pool in a community that may be in danger of losing other public pools
in the region? Will this be considered? Eileen responded that we will never be able to collect and
analyze every piece of data, so we have to figure out what is realistic.

Land Acquisition (Breakout Session 1)
Mark Templeton explained that the draft position paper answers both “Why” we should acquire more land, and
“How” we can acquire more land.
The committee recommends maintaining the goal to protect 21,000 acres through acquisition and/or
collaboration.
Mark provided an overview of the committee’s preliminary recommendations (see Attachment A) and asked
participants for feedback. The following issues were discussed:
Why acquire more land?
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Open space improves all our lives.
You might acquire land which has high ecological value OR you might acquire land that has high social
value.
We also have a need to expand upon our history; don’t use the existing lands as a constraint; see them as
a baseline.
Past advisory papers focused on fragmentation and the ability of the forest preserves to connect to a
system of trails and greenways.
There is economic value in having protected open space. Many communities embrace this.
Some might think about other ways to spend that money: safety, jobs, health, environment, education.
We need to show that this is also a solution to several of these issues—it generates jobs, it promotes
healthier lives AND it protects the environment.
Partnerships and collaborations are important and the FPCC is best positioned to drive this agenda—
whether just in Cook County and/ or in regional partnership with other forest preserves. You are in the
lead; you can drive this.

Land acquisition opportunities and challenges
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

There is land available in northwest, some in Palos, some south, and lots of acres in southeast.
This also can plug into bigger regional planning efforts such as the Millennium Reserve, Chicago’s
watershed plan, and the proposed Calumet Heritage corridor. Consider adding these overlays to this map.
There is a sliding scale from high ecological value to high social value. You may need to think about
acquiring high social value sites, even if they have low ecological value.
Need to be careful about how you present challenge #3, “remaining sites have low ecological value.” You
can restate it to say you can do great good for few dollars by focusing on connections and buffers.
We won’t be able to buy our way out of social challenges with land acquisition. How do we use programs
to connect all residents to nature?
A few well placed “Disney stores” in the city could go a long way.
People support acquisitions because they expect a new trail, a parking lot, etc. They will want these sites
to be developed so they can use them.
24

 Position Statement
•
•
•
•
•
•

Is there a way to use zoning or other regulations to strengthen “protection” of the land?
Just say “accomplish goals of NCCP”; it really accomplishes all four goals.
But some people have no idea what NCCP is so it may be important to explain why it is important to
protect nature and connect people to it.
Whether this is addressed in position statement or not, it has to be addressed in how we tell the story.
How do we ensure land protected via easements is restored to health? What happens if a partner agency
responsible for protecting land goes away?
Limit the FPCC’s role as advocate; they still need to focus on acquisition and restoration. In fact, the
enabling act clearly states FPCC’s mission is to acquire and restore. We are often asked to get involved in
broader policy statements to protect nature, but we have to look at what we are authorized to do.

Other goals and strategies
Mark stated that the committee is also considering how other goals relate to land acquisition, including goals to
protect nature, engage people, engage disadvantaged communities, and provide ecosystem services. There was
not enough time for participants to provide feedback on this section.
Selection criteria
Chris Slattery explained that the FPCC currently uses a range of selection criteria including high ecological value,
providing greenway connections/buffers, and serving a recreational need. FPCC also considers pragmatic factors
such as a willing seller and a reasonable price. And increasingly FPCC is looking at new opportunities through
grants, donations and leveraging limited funds. Assuming equal ecological value, the committee recommends
giving preference to sites which improve access for impacted communities.
Participants offered the following comments:
•

•

•

•

•
•

With no new revenue, this is all a pipe dream. And to get the resources, you have to address racial and
social equity issues. What is the biggest social need we can address? What will address the biggest barrier
to participation?
There are many things we need to do; which of these things does land acquisition address best? There is
a programming layer that doesn’t take $2B. As we think about how to allocate scarce resources, we need
to think about these other tools.
Do we buy more expensive land in Barrington versus less expensive land in Thornton Lansing? Which is
more threatened to be developed? Is this a consideration? Homes in Barrington are built on 5 acre lots;
could there be a policy to limit development to X% of site and protect the rest?
Think about people with different abilities. Do you have spaces for all abilities? Do you have land that
needs to be acquired to protect cultural assets? And then how do you use this land in a socially equitable
way?
Science should lead the way. The land we acquire has to take that into consideration . . . will it be able to
adapt as we become hotter?
Land acquisition is one tool to meet our goals; it may not be the best or most cost-effective tool. Think
about how Beti Guevara connects families from Humboldt Park to nature via our CLIC program. That is a
far more cost-effective way to connect these families to nature versus trying to buy land in or near
Humboldt Park.

25

 Non-traditional strategies
The plan attempts to connect opportunities and provide direction on where land acquisition efforts should focus.
There are many plans for this area: MWRD, Ford Heights, etc. The hope is to collaborate and make sure these
plans work together. There was not enough time for participants to provide feedback on this section.

Land Acquisition (Breakout Session 2)
Mark Templeton presented a set of slides to walk participants through the committee’s journey. Mark asked
participants for input on the general frame and structure, and relative weighing of criteria. Participants offered
the following comments:
Question: Why acquire more land
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

A suggestion was made not to use the word protect more land, maybe say: acquire land to save plants
and animals, prevent flooding, provide recreational opportunities etc.
Include health benefits, and environmental benefits such as clean air clean water; broaden people reasons
(health and recreation, quality of life, enhance interaction with the natural world, and balance inequities
that are related to open space).
Forest preserves provide space for pollinator species to thrive and they in turn pollinate crops.
Add more information about ecosystem services. Economic value to communities. Property Values
should be called out even if we don’t have specific data.
Disney Store idea - all kinds of collaboration opportunities with different tradeoffs.
Say something about safety, and jobs ….
The FP is in the best position to acquire more land – so we can’t wait for others to do so. String it together,
people feel better if we don’t do condemnations.
The FP is lagging peer agencies and we need more land to maintain our status as a leader.
Is it enough to just cover the WHY we need more land, without saying how we will do it? Maybe, yes.

Land Acquisition Opportunities
•
•

•
•

Suggestion to purchase land which is most vulnerable to development, and those are the properties to
the north.
If the goal is just to have more greenspace then go with the cheapest. If the goal is to conserve the
diversity of native plants and animals, then go with the most ecologically significant. Might be a
combination?
Need to think about all the other agencies that own land. MWRD, park districts, TNC, Municipalities,
Millennium Reserve.
The poor planning of municipalities near preserves does not mean the FP has to pick up their slack. It’s
not fair to the millions of Chicago residents who pay taxes toward the preserves.

Challenges
•

•

We don’t have the money, but even if we did, would we want the 21K. The available land is low ecological
value. General agreement that what we own is of the best quality. Should we consider potential future
ecological value of the parcel (ex. farmland)
Consider hiring someone whose job it is to acquire land via non-traditional methods.

26

 Position Statement
•
•
•
•

Should there be something in there about rates (increase the pace – acquire it before it’s gone) It’s a
function of capacity and funding, faster you do it the cheaper it is.
Should we say the FPCC should find the resources? It’s the 800-pound gorilla and needs to be pushed.
How do we influence protection without becoming an advocacy organization?
How do we protect existing land from uses that are not consistent with our mission? Should we suggest
more stringent ordinances?
All papers being created will raise awareness about the NCCP. There has to be a communication strategy
among all four papers.

Selection Criteria (additional considerations)
•
•
•
•
•
•

Cost for operations and development of purchased land.
Can someone else do it?
Overlap with a partner interest.
The first three on our list seem to be a screening lens and the bottom three meshes in some way. But not
a screening.
Popularity may also be a criterion. To get the votes – it may be counter to our mission.
Threshold criteria and Balancing Criteria. Public responsiveness.

Land Acquisition – Notes from Flip Charts (Breakout Sessions 1 & 2)
Why Acquire More?
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

Tie to 5 biggest issues for community (ex.- safety, jobs, health.. Rich Gamble); benefits of clear criteria to
persuade the public
o Enhance quality of life
o Buckets
▪ Ecological – address fragmentation, connect greenways, plants & animals (pollinators),
climate change, easier to manage
▪ Social – health benefits, recreation, open space more generally
▪ Economic – value for surrounding properties (ex. – Orland Grassland), flood
protection/ecosystems services
Best positioned to drive the agenda, maintain our leadership
Where we are is our base; where do we want to go? How? Collaboration needed (Vision issue - Terry G.)
People understand progress toward the goal (Benjamin Cox)
Leverage other resources
Natural growth vs. “NIMBY”
Why $ to acquisition vs restoration?

Challenges
•
•
•
•
•

Disney store/Disney land (presence & partnership opportunities)
“Tension” between ecological and social equity objectives
Do we publicize low ecological value? Different frame (even low ecological value can be valuable – ex.
buffers – Justin Pepper) Consider future eco value
How measure ecological value? Highest “return” on the investment?
Operating funds also needed for the 21,000 acres (more land means more $ needed for O & M)
27

 •
•
•

Get to restoration when we can
Current culture, understanding
Development expectation with people (more capital funds also needed to improve acquired land) – Chris

Racial Equity (Breakout Session 3)
Emily Harris, Tracy Bishop and Kendra Freeman presented an overview of the REDI committee’s preliminary
recommendations. These include:
We believe we should apply a racial equity lens to the work of the Forest Preserves because fundamentally it is
the right thing to do. In addition, if we want to build a community of support, we need the support of everyone
in Cook County.
We also know that equity starts from within. The work of the REDI committee is complemented by the work of
FPCC’s staff REDI team which is analyzing internal processes and policies and developing strategies to advance
racial equity and promote diversity and inclusion throughout the district. The staff REDI team is focusing its initial
efforts on: (a) HR/hiring process, (b) training and development, and (c) outreach.
The REDI committee has begun to explore best practices for authentic and meaningful community engagement.
Kendra Freeman shared lessons learned from various community engagement strategies. These include:
✓ Start by talking early-on to the people who are most impacted (as opposed to starting with proposals).
✓ Think about what you can give, not just what you need.
✓ Offer an event you can plan together as an activity to engage the community.
(The REDI committee’s full presentation is presented in Attachment A.)
Emily asked participants for feedback. The following issues were discussed:
•

•

•
•
•
•
•

How do we have an honest discussion about what is and is not realistic? What if the community wants
something we simply cannot afford? Kendra explained that if it is really a process of inquiry, it starts with
sharing data. She urged honesty and transparency. She suggests being frank. For example, tell the
community, “These are the assessments we did; this option is not financially feasible long-term,” and
provide an explanation of how we reached this conclusion. Let the community know that we don’t want
to identify options in a silo and we want them to understand the constraints.
The land acquisition committee added equity as one criterion to consider in selecting sites for acquisition.
How much do we focus on serving impacted communities through programs, versus buying land? Terry
Guen responded that the Compatible Recreation committee is working with CEP to explore this. Laurel
asked that the results be shared so they can help inform the land acquisition strategy.
I think we could buy land in Chicago if we decided that was important. But for what that would cost, are
there better and more cost-effective ways to achieve the objective of connecting people to nature?
How committed are we? If we are committed to racial diversity and we think programming is the way to
achieve it, do we set up an endowment to fund programs, instead of acquiring more land?
It is great to sit here and listen to different voices talk about what we need to do.
It has been educational and exciting to engage in this conversation. We come into it humbly, admitting
we have a lot to learn.
I think this subject is a little bit like the ocean. Sometimes we try to boil the ocean. It is important to
narrow our scope. We must be transparent about how decisions will get made and how those in need
29

 •

•
•

•

might rely on those who have access to resources. We must make sure the scope is achievable. There is
some low hanging fruit we should pick, celebrate some successes and use that to gain momentum. One
of the worst things you can do to an underserved community is to make another promise that can’t be
delivered on. Keep a record of positive impact. Remind the community that we said we were going to do
this and we did. This is an iterative process.
You don’t always have to start with a list. Sometimes you start by admitting you don’t have all the answers
and inviting the community into the process to help figure it out. It is about making that commitment and
living that commitment and figuring out together where the boundaries are.
FPCC is working with MPC to apply these lessons to a community engagement process at Beaubien Woods.
How do we make sure we have the right stakeholders at the table? This can be very hard. You start with
the “usual suspects” and tap them to connect to others. And you must provide multiple ways to engage
people. Not everyone can come to meetings, so MPC also uses on-line surveys. MPC also helps foster and
support social networks to help engage communities. And MPC includes a stipend to help community
organizations hire a student or other organizer to help with outreach.
It is important to talk about the collective efforts of FPCC, the Zoo, and the Garden. For example, more
than 50% of non-member guests at the Zoo are people of color; this has grown significantly. The Garden
has locations in Lawndale, Garfield Park, and other impacted communities. Thousands of people
participate in programs at these sites each year. NeighborSpace has gardens across the city. Youth
Outdoor Ambassadors connect to impacted communities across the County. The Garden has the Farm on
Ogden and other sites and programs serving impacted communities.

Scaling Up Volunteers (Breakout Session 1)
Wendy Paulson began the discussion by asking: Is the position paper clear? Does it have a declaration that’s
compelling? And she gave some background: volunteerism has been a component of the forest preserves since
its beginning. It became prominent in the 70’s and we want to make the case for why volunteerism is important
and that it’s a very intentional strategy for involving people at the nexus of nature and people. We want to provide
Commissioners, staff and the public a compelling case for a) continuing and b) scaling up the volunteer program.
Discussion points, suggestions, and questions posed included:
•
•

•
•

•
•
•
•
•

Is there buy-in throughout the agency? Can staff trust the skills of volunteer botanists for example?
Paths are unclear. Who will reach out to a school-group and plug them into the system that can ultimately
lead them to be involved in the volunteer system? Example: Laurel’s 15-year-old nephew is volunteering
at Trailside but he doesn’t get a volunteer badge, and isn’t clearly part of the larger VR system
There seems to be a communication gap between some departments and volunteer resources.
We need concrete strategies with outcomes – pick one thing – restoration, could be a focus to engage
communities in each part of the county. Figure out what success would look like. Need to know where
we are doing well and where we need help. Benchmarks are important.
Add something on the website - offer something – volunteer five times – get a free camping night.
Recognize that a lot of volunteers are ephemeral …. how can we sustain them or how do you cast a wide
enough net and allow people to come and go and still fell like part of the team.
Call out and amplify all the great things that already are happening and scale it up!
Focus on inclusivity, provide something for everyone and capitalize on different skill-sets.
Do we all agree that volunteers are important? An opportunity to merge CEP and Volunteer programs.
Is there a disconnect? CEP is already doing everything with volunteers: outreach, teaching, recreation.
30

 •

•

it takes seven touch points to go from learning about volunteering to volunteering. We have a stellar
volunteer opportunity, you cannot do what the volunteers do in Cook County anywhere else. Need more
signs – to invite volunteers
It’s a position paper so we are not going too far in the weeds – think about next level up.

•
•

Make sure volunteers have the appropriate coordination, the available resources, trainings etc.
Make sure that within the recommendations there are some subsets that would help get there. Very
robust to say the staff and volunteers working on this have a compass – that’s really helpful. Suggest a
committee to work across departments to make sure volunteers are integrated? Maybe let staff decide
how to coordinate communication (one level back)
• Don’t forget that another audience is commissioners and external partners …. In fact they are the primary
target, not internal staff.
• There will be a lot of supporting appendices. Zoo and Garden will add case studies.
• Pathway for Zoo volunteers to move to the Forest Preserves.
• REDI – how can we commit with a focus on underserved communities – maybe include a framework point,
underserved communities want to be active (health, economics, finance). Ex: Reach out to science teacher
in underserved communities
• Uncomfortable with the statement that we are focusing on underserved communities to volunteer - drop
it!
• Do we have enough information to identify barriers?
• WE can tell where people are from by zip code. Skews younger. Strategies change depending on where
you are in the county. Be careful not to pigeonhole people. Rules are outlined in the REDI paper. Helpful
to provide baseline data on volunteers. Include our map, too.
• Do a better job of recognizing volunteers – bring them all together.
• Some volunteers don’t enjoy recognition opportunities. Maybe do different events or things for different
regions. Maybe have a speaker come in.
• Consider having a volunteer and staff event/meeting.
• Add a call out box from the Tribune Article that describes the FPCC as having the Best Volunteer
Program anywhere.
• Involve volunteers in all programming – Volunteer Involvement in the Path to Stewardship (Case Study).
• Include volunteer opportunities in signage.
