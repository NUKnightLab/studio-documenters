WASHINGTON ENTERTAINMENT

 

 

 

Hello,

My name is Johnnie Washington. I am the producer of Rib?s RNB Music Festival which has
taken place at Hart Plaza in Downtown Detroit for the past 19 years. I?m proud to say we have
become Midwest largest Rib Fest and voted #1 BBQ festival in the Midwest 2016 by Everfest!
PeOple come from all over the State of Michigan and the great City of Detroit. They come from
near and far Atlanta, Florida, and Chicago just to name a few. Rib?s RNB Music Festival will
take place August 9-11 2019 at Hart Plaza. With the best BBQ this side of the ?Mississippi?
Great food, business vendors, shopping for the family from art to fashion and more. With acts
like DUR HILL KEITH WASHINGTON CHRISETT MICHELL 2018 Regina Belle, Con
Funk Son, Chante Moore, Temptation and so many more international and national artist that?s
performed over the year 2019 will be just as star studded and exciting. We will keep the same
outline as years past to help offset the high cost it takes to produce this world class event. Due to
a con?ict of interest in 2016 with another food event and close in name from our past events,
we?re asking that know food festival or with likeness of our name and brand current and past,

Ribs Soul Ribs Music Festival Should not be allowed to take place 45 day before our
said dates and 30 days after. This will help offset and avoid confusion in marketing from radio,
TV, new ads, and send a clear message on events at Hart Plaza.

Our event will remain free until 5pm on Friday and free Saturday and Sunday until 2:00 pm.
Bowl seating free all day Friday, free Saturday and Sunday until 5:00 pm. $5:00 to $10.00
depending on acts. We will also offer VIP seating on Saturday and Sunday near main stage for
$25.00 or $45.00 daily and $75.00 for full VIP weekend pass. Our commitment to world class
entertainment has not changed. We are also excited this will be our third year featuring our
Detroit Paradise Valley Stage! This stage will highlight Detroit?s best in gospel and jazz artists!
With our continued support from the great City of Detroit and Detroit Parks and Rec. 2019 will
be another banner year for our community.

Thank you.

Johnnie Washington

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

RESOLVED,

Today, millions of Americans engage in bicycling as an
environmentally friendly, sound?form of transportation, an excellent
form of exercise that provides quality family recreation; and

Many studies Show the bene?t to local economies from cyclists buying
local goods and services when communities support cycling
infrastructure; and

The Detroit City Council supports the efforts of the Detroit
Greenways Coalition, in their mission to promote biking, walking, and
trail development throughout Detroit, along with pedestrian safety
education programming, as they endeavor to reduce accidents, injuries
and fatalities to those participating in these activities; and

AS of April 2019, the City has installed more than 240 miles of bike
lanes, compared to 13 miles of bikes lanes offered in 2007, which
signi?es the city?s new commitment to neighborhood planning for
biking, in addition to providing a variety of amenities including
expanded sidewalks, bicycle lanes, improved lighting- all to revive the
City?s neighborhoods; and

City Council recognizes the social and economic value of bicycle and
pedestrian activity as a mechanism for improving the health and
enjoyment of its citizens and to transform Detroit into a more vibrant
place to live, work and visit; and

Through this legislative initiative, City Council continues to promote
and encourage strong bicycle-friendly activities, acknowledging that

BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES

RESOLUTION TO DECLARE MAY 2019 AS BRAIN TUMOR AWARENESS MONTH
IN THE CITY OF DETROIT

WHEREAS, Brain Tumors, speci?cally Glioblastoma, have become recognized in recent years
as one of the deadliest cancers; and

WHEREAS, There are an estimated 760 new diagnoses of brain tumors in Michigan in 2019,
and an estimated 600 Michigan residents will die from a brain tumor in 2019.
Brain tumors can be deadly and can severely impact the quality of life of those
fortunate enough to survive this disease. Brain cancer continues to be the leading
cause of cancer deaths among children and young adults; and

WHEREAS, Brain tumors have the highest per?patient initial cost of care for any cancer
group with an annualized mean net cost of care in 2010 US dollars at well over

$100,000; and

WHEREAS, More than any other cancer, brain tumors can have lasting and life-altering
physical, cognitive, and impacts on a patient?s life.

WHEREAS, The state of Michigan has attained national recognition as a leading center of
excellence in the ?eld of brain tumor treatment and research as a result of the
number of patients traveling to Michigan for clinical trial participation, grant
dollars locally used to create jobs, and professionals specializing in brain tumors
across the state; and

WHEREAS, Detroit is proud to be home to high level brain cancer centers such as the
Hermelin Brain Tumor Center, Children?s Hospital of Michigan and others. We
encourage Detroit residents to continue to be vigilant and proactive when it comes
to their healthcare; and

WHEREAS, Despite the numbers of brain tumors diagnosed annually, and their devastating
prognosis, there have only been four (4) FDA approved drugs and one device to
treat brain tumors in the past thirty years; and

WHEREAS, To date, there have been no drugs developed and approved speci?cally for
malignant pediatric brain tumors. The four FDA approved drugs for brain tumors
have provided only incremental improvements to patient survival, and mortality
rates have remained relatively unchanged over the past 30 years; NOW,
THEREFORE, BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council designates May 2019 as Brain Tumor
Awareness Month in the city of Detroit.
