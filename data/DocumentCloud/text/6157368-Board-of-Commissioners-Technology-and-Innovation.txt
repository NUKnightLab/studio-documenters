Summary: Currently, the Department of Animal and Rabies Control ("DARC") relies upon an aging
mainframe solution and isolated manual processes to manage documents and content related to its
departmental mandates. The proposed system aims to replace legacy operations with a robust Enterprise
Content Management ("ECM") platform that is scalable and will grow with DARC's business needs. The
ECM is also accompanied by a Responsive Design Web Portal that will render across mobile and desktop
devices and transform cumbersome manual processes into automated online services for customers.
The ECM will achieve additional efficiencies by adopting BOT's Hyland OnBase software standard,

Summary: CCRD seeks to replace its current lands record processing and transaction system with a
new technically advanced solution that enables CCRD to achieve its external and internal business goals.
The new solution will encompass all phase of the recording process and adapt to future advances in
technology and changes in CCRD business and operational needs that will enable CCRD to continually
improve it services to the public. The current application is more than 12 years old and has undergone
modest enhancement over time. The current system is limited and outdated in its reporting and
accounting schematics which impacts accuracy and efficiency. The system will enhance our overall
efficiency and bring economies of scale overall.

This is a Comparable Procurement pursuant to Section 34-140 of the Procurement Code. ACS
Enterprise Solutions, LLC. was previously awarded a contract by the Sacramento County, California,
through a Request for Proposals (RFP) process. Cook County wishes to leverage this procurement
effort.
