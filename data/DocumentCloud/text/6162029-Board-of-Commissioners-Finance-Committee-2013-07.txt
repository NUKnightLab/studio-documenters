Reason: Under this proposed extension, the Illinois Housing Development
Authority (IHDA) will continue to operate a toll-free housing counseling
helpline service and manage and administer housing counseling services
to residents in foreclosure. helpline provides critical information
to families facing foreclosure, assigns families to a HUD-certi?ed housing
counseling agency, and schedules housing counseling workshops and
appointments for the families. Housing counseling services are provided
county-wide by 12 HUD-certified subcontractors. Selected after a
rigorous application process, these agencies conduct housing counseling
workshops and provide families with housing counseling on a one-on-one
basis. They help families facing foreclosure apply for loan modi?cations
or develop other options to avoid foreclosure whenever possible. Over the
past year ended March 31, 2013, the IHDA contract assisted more than
32,000 families through the helpline, provided 5,000 families with free
one-on-one housing counseling sessions, and provided more than 3,000
families general housing counseling guidance at more than 100 housing
counseling workshops throughout Cook County. Each family receives an
average of four, one-on?one counseling sessions. As of March 31, 2013,
there were 75,533 mortgage foreclosures pending in the Circuit Court of
Cook County.

IHDA was originally selected to provide the program?s housing
counseling and helpline services in March 2010 with the initiation of the
program. A request for proposals (RFP) process was conducted that year,
but due to on-going and signi?cant program enhancements and
developments, the RFP did not yield satisfactory resultsreview with the Of?ce of the Chief Procurement Officer. This
extension will provide services while the RFP is completed.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $423,000. 00 (W
