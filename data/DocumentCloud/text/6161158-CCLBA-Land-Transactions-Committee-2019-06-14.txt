The following illustration is an average of the number of daily users visiting the CCLBA website over specific time periods. Superimposed
over the bar chart are significant CCLBA events that were promoted by the Land Bank. Over time, one can see an increase in daily users
based on each event as it transpired and how it was promoted. The chart accounts for the number of different users on the CCLBA’s website,
and does not account for people visiting the website more than once. It should also be noted that this chart includes weekend traffic as well,
which is much lower than traffic generated during the week.

 COMMUNITY WEALTH
The community wealth number generated by the Cook County Land Bank, up to the end of the 2018 Fiscal Year, is $42,385,072. This number
represents the difference in the CCLBA’s acquisition price and what the community developer ultimately sold the property. The significance
of this number is that the more community wealth dollars invested in a specific geography, the more dollars a certain geography is worth in
regards to real estate. The following is a breakdown of community wealth by suburban municipalities as well as neighborhoods in Chicago.

 TAX CERTIFICATE PROGRAM
The following is a general overview of the Land Bank’s Tax Certificate Program.
Over the 2015 & 2017 Cook County Scavenger Sales, the CCLBA picked up 17,331 tax
certificates. In destroying what was formerly a real estate speculation industry, the
CCLBA has been able to re-activate parcels that have been in limbo for an extended
period of time due to the outstanding taxes that make these parcels impossible to
redevelop. From a decision making process, the Land Bank has been dedicated to
taking over 32% of all tax certificates acquired at the 2015 Scavenger Sale. This
greatly exceeds the amount of parcels taken to deed by the private market, which is
less than 1%. In addition, over $7.5 million dollars have been returned to the
Cook County coffers due to this activity.
