4. 2014 Tactical Workplan and Budget Review
Commission reviewed 2014 tactical plan and budget. The commission asked for
clarification about cost allocation plan and budget specifically how the SSAs disburse
Rogers Park Business Alliance’s mortgage payment and personnel. Sandi Price,
Executive Director stepped in to explain that personnel is paid according to a formula
including space used by personnel and total budget allotted to each particular SSA (19,
24 and 54). The commission noted an increase in the line item for rent from 2012 and
2013. Ana will get clarification on this.
5. Program and Project Review
The commission discussed how they would continue to sponsor the following special
events and parking lot for 2014:
a. Parking Lot
Ana explained that the City of Chicago no longer allows SSAs to sign contracts
for parking facilities. The commission discussed how it would move forward
with its current contract with Mision Cristiana’s parking lot on the corner of
Morse and Ashland. The commission discussed the possibility of not renewing
the annual lease when it expires in May and paying until December of 2014.
Ana will get clarification from the City of Chicago’s policy since the 2014 budget
was approved the parking lot line item. Commission will decide which action to
take based on the information gathered by Ana at the next SSA meeting.
b. Glenwood Ave. Arts Festival
GAAF will continue to be sponsored by SSA 24 with $10,000.00
c. Glenwood Sunday Market
GSM’s sponsorship will be cut by 50% to $10,000.00. The commission feels
sponsoring the summer market is priority over sponsoring summer AND winter
markets.

 d. Celebrate Clark St. Festival
CCSF’s sponsorship will also be cut by 50% to $5,000.00. Commission discussed
ways in which to raise other sponsorships for festival.
Ana reported that she also cut spending in Mile of Murals project and
landscaping.
