TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS SIGNALS 

West Addison Street and North Lakewood Avenue; All Way Stop Sign, Stopping All
Approaches, NotRecommended. W. Addison Street is a major collector roadway with
significantly higher traffic volumes than N. Lakewood Avenue, a local roadway. Stop
signs on streets with higher volumes such as W. Addison Street tend to increase rear-
end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians
that every vehicle will stop. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an all-way stop at
this intersection (19-00099964) [Or2019?7]

PARKING METERS:

West Division Street (north and south sides) from North Wood Street to North Honore
Street, and West Division Street (north side) from North Marion Court to North Wolcott
Avenue, and West Division Street (north side) from North Wolcott Avenue to North
Damen Avenue, and West Division Street (south side) from North Wolcott Avenue to

WARD TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS SIGNALS:

16 South California Avenue at West Street; Two Way Stop Sign, Stopping north and

with significantly higher traffic volumes than W. 61st Street, a local roadway. Stop
signs on streets with higher volumes such as S. California Avenue tend to increase
rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for
pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an
all-way stop at this intersection (19-00098820) [Or2019-59]
