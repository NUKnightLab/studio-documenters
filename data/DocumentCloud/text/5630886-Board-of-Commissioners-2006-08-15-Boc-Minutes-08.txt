 Commissioner Young then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Resolutions for
Items A1 thru A7 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services
Committee.
(Item A1)
In September 2004, the Board approved a two-year contract with three one-year extension
options with the Spanish Coalition for Housing to operate three CHA Latino Site Offices and
provide intake, marketing, and outreach services to the Latino community on behalf of the CHA,
as required by the Latino Consent Decree. During the base contract term, Spanish Coalition
assisted close to 10,000 people by providing them with a variety of services related to CHA and
non-CHA assistance programs. The resolution for Item A1 approves the first option of Spanish
Coalition’s contract. Under the extension option, Spanish Coalition will continue to provide the
aforementioned services and will conduct outreach activities and homeownership preparedness
for affordable housing opportunities within the mixed-income developments, such as those that
will be built as a result of the Lathrop redevelopment. Since the CHA is currently considering
merging the services under this contract with some of the services that the Spanish Coalition for
Housing provides under contract with CHAC, the Authority is seeking to exercise the first
extension option for a period of only seven months.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-116
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated August 7,
2006, titled “Authorization to exercise the first option of Contract No. 0673 with
the Spanish Coalition for Housing for Marketing Outreach, and Intake Services to
the Latino Population for CHA Programs,”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into the first option of the Contract No. 0673 (“Contract”) with
the Spanish Coalition for Housing to provide marketing, outreach, and intake
services to the Latino population for the period of August 1, 2006 through
February 28, 2007, and to increase the Contract’s not-to-exceed compensation
amount by $297,966.00. The Contract’s aggregate not-to-exceed compensation
amount will be $1,275,362.00.

(Item A2)
In September 2005, the CHA entered into a contract with Acculingua International to provide
English-to-Spanish, as well as Spanish-to-English, translation and interpretation services, as
required by the Latino Consent Decree. Under the Contract, Acculingua International translates
key CHA documents and provides oral interpretation services at CHA public meetings, which
affect or are intended for CHA residents, applicants, and potential applicants. The Contract was
for a base term of one year with a not-to-exceed amount of $90,000. The option term is for oneyear and increases the not-to-exceed amount by $70,000. Acculingua International has met all of
its obligations as stipulated in the contract. Accordingly, the resolution for Item A2 approves
exercising the one-year option contract with Acculingua International.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-117
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated August 7,
2006, titled “Authorization to exercise the one-year option of Contract No. 5149
with Acculingua International, Inc. of IL D/B/A/ Inlingua for translation and
interpretation services,”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee to exercise the one (1) year extension option of Contract
No. 5149 (“Contract”) with Acculingua International, Inc. to provide translation
and interpretation services for the period of September 1, 2006 through August
31, 2007, and to increase the Contract’s not-to-exceed compensation amount by
$70,000.00. The Contract’s aggregate not-to-exceed compensation amount will be
$160,000.00.

(Item A3)

 In February 2002, the Board approved an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) between the CHA,
the Housing Authority of Cook County, the Lake County Housing Authority, the Illinois
Housing Development Authority and the Metropolitan Planning Council to establish the
Regional Housing Initiative (RHI). RHI was created in order to stimulate the supply of rental
housing across the metropolitan region for low-income families by pooling together Housing
Choice Vouchers to establish project-based developments. The goal of the RHI program is to
promote attractive mixed income housing development that meets community and regional
needs, with particular focus on locations near jobs and public transit, design to promote
efficiency, mixed income and strong management. The resolution for Item A3 approves a HAP
Contract with Hispanic Housing Development Corporation to provide ten Project-Based Housing
Choice Vouchers and approves the recommendation of the Regional Housing Initiative to
allocate six Project-Based vouchers to the North Avenue Redevelopment project. The North
Avenue Redevelopment project is located in the West Town Community of Chicago at 2634-54
West North Avenue in between Talman and Washtenaw. Located along one of Chicago’s major
thoroughfares a vacant building will be renovated while vacant land and two frame buildings will
be improved with new construction of a 5 story apartment building. A total of 77 new units of
affordable housing will be created. North Avenue Redevelopment Apartments will consist of
affordable rental units targeting household incomes of not greater than 80% of the area median
income. The development includes two distinct rental uses that will occur simultaneously; 24
units of family housing in a unique Lease-to-Own renovation and 53 units of “near elderly’
housing for those 55 and older in a newly constructed 5-story building. The renovation phase of
a vacant four story warehouse will result in a 24 unit apartment building for families with a mix
of 1, 2, and 3 bedroom units. Phase I is the adaptive reuse of two underutilized buildings into
rental housing. The buildings feature historic facades, high ceilings, and will include general
lay-outs. One bedroom units will average 855 square feet and will rent from $525-$1000 for 4080% of median income. Two bedroom units will average 1,126 square feet and will rent from
$825-$1050 for 60-80% of median income. Three bedroom units will average 1,409 square feet
and will rent from $925-$1200 for 60-80% of median income. The most important feature of
this first phase is the opportunity of Hispanic Housing Corporation, as a not-for-profit, to
purchase this property in the 15th year for “debt and exit taxes” and in turn sell these units to the
residents as condominium units.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-118
WHEREAS: the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board letter dated August 7, 2006
requesting authorization to enter into a housing assistance payment contract
(“HAP Contract”) with the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation to
provide ten (10) Project-Based Housing Choice Vouchers and approve the
recommendation of the Regional Housing Initiative to allocate six (6) ProjectBased vouchers to the North Avenue Redevelopment development, an affordable
housing development:
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT:

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a housing assistance payment contract (“HAP Contract”)
with Hispanic Housing Development Corporation to provide Project-Based
Housing Choice Voucher assistance for ten (10) units and approve the
recommendation of the Regional Housing Initiative to allocate six (6) ProjectBased vouchers in the North Avenue Redevelopment project, an affordable
housing development, for the maximum allowable term, subject to any necessary
HUD approvals.

THAT:

the Chief Executive Officer or his designee is further authorized to take all actions
and execute all documents necessary to implement the foregoing.

(Item A4)
In October 1999, the CHA embarked upon its Plan for Transformation. The Plan represents the
largest reconstruction of public housing in the United States. In addition to rebuilding housing,
the CHA has committed to provide access to opportunities for families impacted by the Plan to
promote self-sufficiency. Customized Job Training Programs (CJT) and Transitional Job
Training Programs (TJ) are considered best practices for individuals who have little or no work
experience or who are not as advanced educationally. Accordingly, the CHA released a Request
for Proposal in May 2006, to competitively solicit consulting services to provide comprehensive
6

 job training services set in a real work environment that will lead to unsubsidized employment
for CHA residents and relocatees. The solicitation was advertised in area newspapers in addition
to CHA’s website. Of the eight proposals received, it was determined that three firms were in
the competitive range. All three firms made oral presentations and submitted Best and Final
Offers after negotiations. After further evaluation and consideration of the Best and Final Offers,
the evaluation committee determined that Jobs for Youth/OAI, Inc., Career Advancement
Network and Heartland Human Care Services, Inc. had the best ability as well as providing the
best overall economic value to provide the required services. The resolution for Item A4
therefore approves award of contact to the three mentioned firms.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-119
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 7, 2006
entitled “Authorization to award three (3) contracts to provide Employment
Training and Placement Programs for CHA residents and relocatees”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute contracts, each for a two (2) year base term and two (2) oneyear option periods, with Jobs for Youth/OAI, Inc., in the amount of $140,000.00,
Career Advancement Network in the amount of $240,000.00 and Heartland
Human Care Services in the amount of $616,000.00 to provide employment
training and placement programs for CHA residents in an aggregate amount notto-exceed $996,000.00.

(Item A5)
The resolution for Item A5 approves a HAP Contract with the Davis Group to provide ProjectBased Housing Choice Voucher assistance for fifty units in the Cleveland Towers development,
a supportive housing development. As the Plan for Transformation and the City’s Plan to End
Homelessness progress, some families and individuals will have special needs that require more
services than are available in public housing and emergency or transitional shelters. The Davis
Group/Near West Side Community Development Corporation/Occam Capital Inc. will construct
an all masonry structure at 800 N. Cleveland Avenue in the Kingsbury Park neighborhood which
was formerly known as the Montgomery Ward corporate complex. The project consists of new
construction of 107 rental apartment units for senior citizens ages 55 years and older. Including
4,100 sq ft of retail on the ground floor, and community room and fitness center on the second
floor, the proposed development will be a 13-story, masonry structure located within a
developing area adjacent to the Cabrini-Green public housing development in Chicago’s Near
North Side Community Area. The building will be a mixed-income development that will
include 50 project-based voucher units for CHA residents, 32 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit
units reserved for households with income below 60% of the area median, and 25 market-rate
units that will be open to senior households without income-restrictions. . The total development
cost of the project is $13,689,163. The project is scheduled to start in October 2006 and
conclude in October 2007.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-120
WHEREAS: the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board letter dated August 7, 2006
requesting authorization to enter into a housing assistance payment contract
(“HAP Contract”) with the Davis Group to provide fifty (50) Project-Based
Housing Choice Vouchers to the Cleveland Towers development, a supportive
housing development for seniors:
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT:

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a housing assistance payment contract (“HAP Contract”)
with the Davis Group to provide Project-Based Housing Choice Voucher
assistance for fifty (50) units in the Cleveland Towers development, a supportive
housing development, for the maximum allowable term, subject to any necessary
HUD approvals.

THAT:

the Chief Executive Officer or his designee is further authorized to take all actions
and execute all documents necessary to implement the foregoing.

 (Item A6)
According to Federal regulations, the CHA is required to maintain the Administrative Plan for
Housing Choice Vouchers, Project-Based Vouchers and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs that
outlines the rules and procedures necessary to administer the voucher program. The
Administrative Plan is also used by the program administrator, CHAC, Inc., to ensure proper
administration of the voucher program according to the policies set forth by this Board of
Commissioners. The resolution for Item A6 approves revisions to the Administrative Plan
based on modifications to the administrative procedures to the Housing Choice Voucher
Program, and to bring the Administrative Plan into conformance with updates and amendments
to the Federal regulations.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006- CHA-121
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 7, 2006
entitled “Approval of the Administrative Plan for the Housing Choice Vouchers,
Project-Based Vouchers and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs.”

Exhibit A.

THAT,

the revised Administrative Plan for the Housing Choice Vouchers, Project-Based
Vouchers and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs dated July 17, 2006 shall be
effective August 15, 2006.

(Item A7)
The Neighborhood Technology Resource Center (NTRC) is using the existing facilities at the
Family Investment Center to develop, market and conduct programs and curricula that focuses
on preparing residents for employment in the information technology field. For the last two
years, NTRC has been assessing the occupational skills of interested public housing residents,
training residents in anticipation of job placement in information technology related employment
and assisting residents in job placement efforts. NTRC has also been upgrading and maintaining
the Authority’s The Right Moves Net web portal. To date, NTRC has provided the CHA with
outstanding service and has performed all tasks required. Accordingly, the resolution for Item
A7 approves contract amendment with NTRC for the period of November 1, 2006 through
October 31, 2007.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-122
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the

Commissioner Ivers then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of resolutions for
Items B1 and B2 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Operations &
Facilities Committee.
(Item B1)
The resolution for Item B1 approves award of three contracts for demolition of seven nondwelling structures throughout CHA. These structures no longer serve a useful purpose and their
demolition is needed as part of the ongoing Plan for Transformation. In May 2006, the Authority
advertised an IFB in local newspapers, on the CHA website and also faxed solicitations to fortynine firms, including ten MBE/WBE/DBE firms. The criteria for awarding contracts was based
on the lowest individual bid for each of the five Site packages from responsive and responsible
bidders. After reviewing the bids, the evaluation committee determined the lowest responsive
and responsible bidders to be Brandenburg Industrial Service Company for Sites No. 4 and 5,
Delta Demolition for Sites No. 1 and 2, and NF Demolition for Site No. 3.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-123
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated August 9, 2006
entitled “Authorization to execute contracts with Brandenburg Demolition, Delta
Demolition, and NF Demolition for Demolition of Non-Dwelling Building

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute contracts with Brandenburg Industrial Service Company in
the amount of $281,169.00 to demolish the single non-dwelling structure included
in the Site No. 4 package and the single non-dwelling structure included in the

(Item B2)
The resolution for Item B2 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City Department
of Planning and Development to utilize DPD for a TIF consultant to create a TIF Plan for the
LeClaire Courts community. The Plan for Transformation has identified the LeClaire Courts
and LeClaire Courts Extension as redevelopment areas. In order to effectively create a
commercial and residential community redevelopment plan, a TIF study of LeClaire Courts,
LeClaire Courts Extension, and community areas is necessary to determine the financial stability
and enhanced tax potential of the land. The study will also highlight the community’s land use,
needs and physical assessment. Once the TIF plan is complete, a master planning process will
follow, continuing the redevelopment progress for LeClaire Courts, LeClaire Courts Extension,
and the Cicero Avenue Corridor, north of Chicago’s Midway Airport. DPD’s solicitation for the
TIF Planners was established to address the need to perform research and generate TIF plans in a
timely and professional manner. The pool of planning consultants, expected to be approved by
the City shortly, was competitively procured and is qualified to provide the required services.
RESOLUTION NO. 2006-CHA-124
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated August 7, 2006,
requesting authorization to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the
City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development (DPD) to utilize DPD

designee to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago
Department of Planning and Development (DPD) to utilize DPD for a Tax

place to meet its managerial needs as well as federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The
CHA’s MAP Department works in conjunction with other CHA departments to provide policy
and procedure development and analysis to the CHA. These projects are often simultaneous and

exemplary service and has performed all tasks expected. Responsibilities have included training
and development in public housing policies and procedures, creating training curriculum and
delivery of training for the Senior Housing Designated Plan, as well as conducting training for
