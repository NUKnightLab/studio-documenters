Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to read the following letter from Thomas J. Glaser, Chief
Financial Officer and John F. Chambers, County Comptroller into the record:
February 20, 2004
The Honorable President and Members of the
Cook County Board of Commissioners
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The delay in the passage of the FY2004 budget to well into the first quarter of the current fiscal
year, has provided us the opportunity to refine our Estimates of Revenues and Available
Resources for Fiscal Year 2004, including revised estimates of the financial condition of the
several funds of Cook County at the close of Fiscal Year 2003.
Specifically, we are decreasing the FY2004 revenue estimates, originally presented on November
8, 2003, by $5,488,411 as follows:
Cigarette Tax – increasing the revenue estimate $32,375,000 to $69,375,000 to reflect the
proposed increase in cigarette taxes from 18 cents per pack to $1.00 per pack. (See page 51 of
the Revenue Estimate book).
Treasurer Indemnity Fund Escheatment – increasing the revenue estimate $6,000,000 to
$48,575,000 to reflect a change in estimate by the Treasurer. (See page 54 of the Revenue
Estimate book).
Unknown Heirs Legal Settlement – increasing the revenue estimate $14,136,589 to reflect the use
of these one-time revenues to close the budget deficit. (See page 58 of the Revenue Estimate
book).
Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax – decreasing the revenue estimate $47,000,000 to $0,
reflecting the withdrawal of this proposed tax. (See page 51 of the Revenue Estimate book).
County Sales Tax – decreasing the revenue estimate $11,000,000 to $273,000,000 reflecting the
withdrawal of the proposed 0.25% tax increase to 1.0%. The tax on general merchandise will
presently remain at ¾%. (See page 68 of the Revenue Estimate book).
With passage of the final budget and closing of our books for FY2003, we will report to this
Honorable Body, the revised and final figures.
If you have any questions, we are, as always, pleased to respond.
Sincerely,
THOMAS J. GLASER
Chief Financial Officer

JOHN F. CHAMBERS
County Comptroller
