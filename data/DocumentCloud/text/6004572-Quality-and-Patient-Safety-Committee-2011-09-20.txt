Report from System Interim Chief Medical Officer
Dr. Claudia Fegan, System Interim Chief Medical Officer, provided an update on wind-down activities at Oak
Forest Hospital. One of these activities is the orderly wind-down of medical staff; efforts are being made to
ensure that the physicians who were previously credentialed only at Oak Forest Hospital will be credentialed at
either Provident Hospital or Stroger Hospital.
Dr. Fegan noted the challenges that the System faces with regard to the budget this year. She stated that, as a
result, they will use this as an opportunity to review and re-engineer the framework for quality for the System.
By simplifying and streamlining the reporting process, she stated that they hope to improve and refine the
quality reporting.

Report from System Director of Quality and Patient Safety (Attachment #1)
A. System Quality and Safety Dashboard
i. Quality report from the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County
(Attachment #2)
Barbara Farrell, System Director of Quality and Patient Safety, reviewed the System Quality and Safety
Dashboard. Included in the information was an update on the Emergency Department transfers from Provident
Hospital to Stroger Hospital, and an update on the Emergency Department transfers from Oak Forest Hospital to
Stroger Hospital during the period of June through August 2011.
Chairman Ansell inquired whether the roll-up core measure score can be provided in the future. Ms Farrell
responded affirmatively; she stated that this will be included the next time this report is presented. Additionally,
the Committee discussed the subject of measures regarding pneumococcal vaccinations; it was noted that the
scores usually increase when the vaccine is administered at patient admission, rather than at discharge.
Chairman Ansell requested that an update be provided in the near future, on the System’s plans with regard to
the subject of meaningful use and the opportunity to tie government dollars to performance, by representatives
from Information Technology.
The following individuals presented the quality report from the Ambulatory and Community Health Network
(ACHN): Dr. Enrique Martinez, Irv Pikelny and Irene Marks. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.
Ms. Driscoll asked why Fantus Clinic and Stroger Hospital specialty clinics’ data was not included. Dr.
Martinez responded that they were not included because their metrics are a bit different from the other ACHN
clinics. Chairman Ansell requested that the Committee receive an update regarding Fantus Clinic and the
Stroger Hospital specialty clinics at the next meeting.
The Committee received and filed the report.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees (continued)
Dr. Anwer Hussain, President of the Executive Medical Staff of Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County,
presented an update on the transition activities related to Oak Forest Hospital. He stated that on September
1st, it has become an immediate care center; this means that, in an emergency, ATI (ambulance
transportation company with whom the System contracts) or 911 is called, depending on the situation. He
noted that every 911 phone call costs a patient approximately $1,100, so staff is very careful in determining
whether to call ATI or 911. Additionally, Dr. Hussain stated that there are other related issues; he indicated
that discussions are being held with the Village of Oak Forest, as the Village is currently not responsible for
911 services for the clinic areas.
Dr. Hussain thanked the System leaders for their support, feedback and guidance. Chairman Ansell thanked
Dr. Hussain for his leadership and ability to manage through this transition.
Following Dr. Hussain’s report, Chairman Ansell stated that there are metrics relating to the Oak Forest
transition that should be reported to the Committee on a regular basis. He asked Dr. Hussain to work with
Ms. Farrell to develop a report of these measures. Dr. Mason noted that the System is required to report
back to the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board on several issues. He requested that the
following be included in the metrics related to the Oak Forest transition: the number of patients who were
treated, discharged and transported back to Oak Forest from Stroger Hospital. Chairman Ansell also
requested that an update be provided, perhaps in November, on the Regional Outpatient Center.
Dr. David Goldberg, President of the Executive Medical Staff of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County, presented his report. He stated that, on some of the Medical/Surgical units, doctors and nurses are
starting to round together; they have designated times where they are starting to talk with one another about
patients that they share. Additionally, Dr. Goldberg noted that the first Schwartz Rounds were recently held
on-site.
