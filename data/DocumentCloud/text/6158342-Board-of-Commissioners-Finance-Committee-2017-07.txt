AN ORDINANCE PROVIDING FOR THE ISSUANCE OF GENERAL OBLIGATION
REFUNDING BONDS OF THE COUNTY OF COOK, ILLINOIS.
WHEREAS, Section 6(a) of Article VII of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that “a County
which has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of the County ... (is) a Home Rule Unit” and The
County of Cook, Illinois (the “County”), has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of the County and
is therefore a Home Rule Unit and may, under the power granted by said Section 6(a) of Article VII of the 1970
Constitution of the State of Illinois, as supplemented by the Local Government Debt Reform Act of the State of
Illinois, as amended (the “Debt Reform Act”), and the other Omnibus Bond Acts, as amended, exercise any power
and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs, including, but not limited to, the power to tax
and to incur debt; and
WHEREAS, the County has the power to incur debt payable from ad valorem property tax receipts or from any
other lawful source and maturing within 40 years from the time it is incurred without prior referendum approval;
and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the County (the “Corporate Authorities”) has not adopted any
ordinance, resolution, order or motion or provided any County Code provisions which restrict or limit the
exercise of the home rule powers of the County in the issuance of general obligation bonds without referendum
for corporate purposes or which provides any special rules or procedures for the exercise of such power; and
WHEREAS, the County has heretofore issued and there are now outstanding General Obligation Refunding
Bonds, Series 2006B (the “2006B Bonds” or the “Prior Bonds”); and
WHEREAS, the 2006B Bonds are now outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $129,860,000, mature
and are subject to optional redemption on the dates and as provided in the ordinances adopted by the Corporate
Authorities on the 19th day of September, 2002, and on the 5th day of January, 2005, authorizing the issuance of
the 2006B Bonds; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the County and its citizens and is necessary for the government and affairs
of the County to authorize the refunding (the “Refunding”) from time to time of all or a portion of the 2006B
Bonds, or of all or any portion of any installment of interest coming due thereon, all as may be advisable from
time to time in order to achieve debt service savings for the County or to restructure the debt service burden on
the County; and
WHEREAS, the aggregate costs of the Refunding, including consulting, financial advisory, legal services,
underwriters’ discount, trustee and other financial fees as shall be necessary, are less than the anticipated savings
to be generated from the Refunding; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities accordingly do hereby determine that it is advisable and in the best interests
Page 11 of 19

 of the County to borrow from time to time for the purpose of the Refunding, and to pay costs of issuance, and, in
evidence of such borrowing, to issue one or more series of full faith and credit bonds of the County as hereinafter
