III. Action Items (continued)
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Review of all of the requests by Contract Compliance has not yet been completed; it was respectfully requested
that the Committee conditionally approve these requests, pending the completion of review by Contract
Compliance.
Chairman Collens asked Mr. Elwell to provide an overview of any sole-source contractual requests; Mr. Elwell
reviewed the three (3) sole source contractual matters presented for the Committee’s consideration (request
numbers 11, 17 and 19).
With regard to request number 11, Chairman Collens inquired whether there is any way of knowing whether
the System is paying a comparable price for this kind of service. Mr. Elwell stated that the County is using the
same vendor for this service, with like pricing; it is difficult to determine because the time and attendance
system is an older system – in terms of trying to benchmark against other hospitals, most of those hospitals are
using significantly different systems.
With regard to request number 17, Mr. Elwell stated that the nitric oxide is used in the Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit; the delivery system is proprietary and is the only one that is considered safe for this group of patients.
With regard to request number 19, Mr. Elwell stated that Translogic is the company that installed the
pneumatic tube system; this contract is sole source because the pneumatic tube system utilizes proprietary
software and hardware that can only be upgraded and maintained by factory-trained technicians employed by
Translogic Corporation.
With regard to request number 2, questions were raised regarding the current Medicaid benefits allowed for
adult dental care. Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, indicated that he can provide the detail
of benefits; he noted that benefits were restored on July 1st, back to the full adult benefit level prior to the
SMART Act implementation.
Chairman Collens asked Mr. Elwell to provide additional information on the competitive selection
methodology used for request number 14. Mr. Elwell stated that, under the CCHHS Procurement Policy, if
another governmental agency has awarded a contract through a competitive method for the purchase of the
same or similar supplies, materials, equipment or services as those sought by the System, the System can
purchase from that vendor at a price or rate at least as favorable as that obtained by the other government
agency without engaging in a competitive procurement method; in this case, this vendor had a contract with
the State of Oregon.
This vendor is the broker for these services, and is a much larger organization of
transportation companies that will be able to keep up with the System’s needs. The total contract amount
includes the transportation services, which is the largest piece, and includes the vendor’s charge for being the
broker; with regard to a question pertaining to the vendor and the comparable government’s locations outside
of the State of Illinois and how that might affect pricing, Mr. Elwell stated that the broker’s fee is very similar
no matter where the transportation services are provided. He indicated that he will provide information on the
percentage that represents the broker’s fee.

III. Action Items
C. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 4, Director Wiese inquired as to the criteria used to evaluate these facilities.
Mr. Elwell stated that, on a weekly basis, personnel visit these patients to determine whether the care being
provided is appropriate, is of good quality, and is helping that patient progress to the next level. Staff are
developing the criteria for the new Request for Proposals (RFP) that will be released; he noted that the
administration plans to develop criteria around all of its post-acute business, in terms of what it takes to make a
good partner, what metrics will be met, and the consequences for not meeting those metrics.
Director Estrada noted that the common denominator of all three (3) sole source contracts is that the vendors
are all located outside of the State of Illinois. Although they do have proprietary or patented technology, he
stressed the importance of the philosophy to have additional contractors vetted who are located in the State of
Illinois. Additionally, he mentioned that two (2) of the requests are pending review by Contract Compliance;
he stated that he wants to make sure they are no longer pending review. Mr. Elwell stated that it is the practice
that the administration will not sign any contract until Contract Compliance has completed review; that is a
Board directive, and that directive is followed 100% of the time. He added that it is the System’s goal to not
only have contracts with vendors located within the State of Illinois, but more specifically to have them with
vendors located in Cook County.
Director Estrada, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 21, subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance where
appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Request number 14 was withdrawn from consideration at the May 29, 2015
CCHHS Board Meeting.
Additionally, at the May 29, 2015 CCHHS Board Meeting, request number 5 was
conditionally approved, pending being found responsive to the Minority- and WomenOwned Business Enterprise provisions in the Cook County Ordinance on Procurement
and Contracting, which provisions are included in the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System Procurement Policy.

IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (continued)
Mr. Elwell provided an update on an issue that impacts both detainee care and behavioral health opportunities
and challenges. The administration expects to bring the strategic plan around behavioral health to the Board
in June; work began on that approximately one (1) month ago, and the hope was to bring it to the Board in
July, but because things are changing so quickly it is better to bring it to the Board sooner. This plan will have
a significant influence on the System’s opportunities to care for its detainees, and will likely prevent many
individuals with behavioral health issues from becoming detainees in the first place. He noted that, by getting
in front of the issue, the administration would like to start moving towards the goal of having fewer than 600
people with behavioral health issues at any given time in the jail; this means a reduction to the number that are
currently in the jail today.
One of the areas that continues to be a challenge financially is the behavioral health community; Mr. Elwell
stated that this community suffered as a result of the Medicaid reductions imposed under the SMART Act this community has not totally recovered.
The Board is aware of the recent transaction relating to
Community Counseling Centers of Chicago (C4); at this point, the administration has only signed a provider
agreement with C4 – it does not currently have an ownership interest in C4, but it does have an interest in its
survival. If C4 were to completely close, the administration believes that the area providers, including the
System, will be affected by their demise in two ways: 1) additional patients will present to emergency
departments (EDs); and 2) many will end up at Cermak Health Services (Cermak). He stated that, when
looking at this population and those who have been in Cermak in the last three (3) years, there is a fairly strong
correlation; he reminded the Committee that detainees and those being treated in Cermak move into a no-pay
situation, even when they are eligible for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) when they are not a detainee and are
outside of Cermak.
Chairman Collens inquired whether services for the patients of C4 are being paid for by the State of Illinois.
Mr. Elwell responded that C4 has a number of contracts with the State that are paying for some of the people
they care for, but not for all patients. Additionally, some of the payments from the State do not cover the full
cost to provide the care to the individuals. Director Estrada provided information based on his experience, as
President and Chief Executive Officer of Metropolitan Family Services (MFS). He stated that a great majority
of MFS’ funding comes from the State of Illinois; money is privately raised to subsidize the care that is
needed. He believes that C4 has traditionally had less of a capacity to privately raise money, so they are more
dependent on State funding than MFS has been.
Mr. Elwell stated that C4 has a very large Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) team; that group is on-call
24 hours /7 days a week, and goes to wherever an individual is when they are in crisis. He noted that this is a
service that is not as available in the community as it should be.
Mr. Elwell stated that if C4 goes out of business tomorrow, the System would lose the pre-payment made, but
there is no other obligation. The System has not assumed nor guaranteed their debt; it wants to assist C4 so
they can be viable, which helps the System. Mr. Elwell noted that the administration is interested in
expanding what C4 is doing, by putting together a forensic ACT team, which again prevents admissions. The
System has a large risk exposure with children with special needs down at La Rabida; C4 had a clinic at La
Rabida and had to close it due to financial reasons. The administration would like to see that re-opened,
because that could mean a $2 million savings to the System’s bottom line. Additionally, there are certain areas
of the south suburban communities where there are virtually no services provided; the administration believes
that it would be easier to take C4’s model and move it there, which would be better than creating a model from
scratch.

IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (continued)
Director Junge stated that it is difficult to predict which patients from C4 would come to the System’s ED if
C4 were to close; however, when the City’s mental health clinics closed, there was an estimate that ED
admissions went up 30%, which was due to treating people with active mental health issues who needed, for
example, 24 hour observation. She stated that lot of System patients would benefit from this relationship
between the System and C4; this would fill an important void.
Director Estrada noted that the provision of mental health services in a community-based setting is generally a
money-loser. If C4 were to close down completely, he was unsure how likely it would be for a place like MFS
or Thresholds to want their contracts, because they would have to raise private dollars to make them whole.
Additionally, the collateral damage when something like this happens can be tough; one such consequence is
losing employees or parts of teams that work there. He inquired whether the administration has been assured
that the teams will be kept whole; he added that every single community mental health provider has open
positions available. Mr. Elwell responded that the System began considering this matter as a business strategy
for itself, so quickly stabilizing C4 was important. Their staffing has dropped from 270 to 251 employees;
this is being closely watched, because there is no benefit to the patients or the System if staffing drops below a
certain level. The administration will provide them some guidance, because it wants to protect its investment;
additionally, it will try to build a continuum and have more control where the System’s money is going.
With regard to the information presented in the Financial Statements, Board Chairman Hammock noted that
each of the columns on pages 2 through 4 indicate that the data is year-to-date, but do not reflect which month
it is through. Mr. Elwell stated that the data is through March; he indicated that this information will be
included in future presentations.
Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the $100 million increase seen between February and March
2015 in the line for per-member per-month (PMPM) revenue on Page 1; he noted that the previous months’
increases were approximately $50 million. Mr. Elwell stated that the larger increase is due to the following:
1) it reflects the rapid growth of the Family Health Plan (FHP) population; and 2) it reflects the fact that the
State was not originally paying CountyCare for the FHP population. March was the first month that the State
started paying CountyCare for the FHP population; he noted that big gains should be seen in April, too, due to
this. Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the data under domestic claims; he stated that, from
December through February, it went from $17 million to $34 million to $52 million, then in March it increased
by a much smaller margin, to $56 million. Mr. Elwell stated that, in March, the administration changed the
formula for the cost to charge ratios; they reevaluated the formula based on what they think it will actually be.
Board Chairman Hammock requested that, in the future, when something is way off the pattern, it would be
helpful if these were highlighted and explained to the Committee.
During the discussion of the information on membership totals on slide 2 of the CountyCare presentation,
Chairman Collens inquired whether the administration expects to meet budget projections for membership by
the end of the year. Mr. Glass responded that, in total, they will probably not be met; budget projections may
be met in perhaps two of the three populations. He indicated that, because the Seniors and Persons with
Disabilities numbers are so off, he does not expect to meet budget projections for that population by the end of
the year.
There were no emergency purchases to report at this time.
Director Estrada, seconded by Director Wiese, moved to receive and file the five (5)
reports under Section IV. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Re: May 22, 2015 Finance Committee Meeting
Item Approval of payment to Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council
(MCHC)

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) establish rates for a variety of hospital
reimbursement streams. Many of the reimbursement rates are based on economic factors within a
geographical area coupled with data submitted by hospitals. Most CMS reimbursement streams
are a zero-sum game. If one geographic area receives a higher reimbursement, then a subsequent
decrease occurs in another area[s). Once rates are established, hospitals have the ability to appeal.
Hospitals will often participate in group appeals of CMS decisions led by the local or state hospital
association to both reduce the cost of litigation, but also to improve the likelihood of settlement.
usually joins with the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council for these appeals.

The cost of the appeal is most often contingency based and only payable upon success. In
December, received notice of a successful appeal on the Budget Neutrality Appeal 2. This
was a Medicare appeal for Federal Fiscal years 2007-2011. It amounted to a total of $1.86 million
for hospitals. After fees of $246,061, the net benefit was a little more than $1.61 million.

Due to the nature of the process and the inability to predict the outcome, fees are paid post?
settlement. We are seeking board approval to pay the fees incurred on this appeal.

Attached you will find the detail per hospital.

Provision on fees from the Engagement Letter for Medicare Group Appeal Challenging Errors in the
Standardized Amount (executed between the Hospital and Baker Healthcare Consulting)

To fairly apportion the fees associated with this appeal, services will be billed to all
participants throughout the U. S. and its territories on a pro rata basis, depending upon
each participating provider?s estimated amount in controversy compared to the total
estimated amount in controversy for all participating providers. There may be multiple
PRRB groups formed to challenge this issue. Administratively, however, we will treat all
groups as a single project.

BHC will bill quarterly for Mr. Baker?s consulting services and the legal costs and
expenses incurred on this project at a discounted rate of eighty percent of
standard hourly rates. Dale Baker?s 2012 standard rate is $520 per hour, and Hall
Render attorneys? standard hourly rates range from $495 for the most senior partner to

195 for new associates. All hourly fees and reasonable expenses for services rendered
by BHC or Hall Render on behalf of BHC shall be paid to BHC.

BHC, Hall Render, and the Association will share a success fee of 13.3% of the
Recovered Amount, to be divided as follows: Association: BHC and Hall Render:
10%. The success fees will apply to all individual years under appeal. For purposes of
this engagement, ?Recovered Amount? includes any additional reimbursement recovered
in connection with this matter, be it through settlement, administrative resolution,
litigation, adoption of new regulations or enactment of new legislation addressing the
matter, less fees and out-of?pocket expenses. The Recovered Amount will include only
the additional reimbursement obtained retroactively.

Provision on fees from the Engagement Letter for Medicare Group Appeal Challenging Errors in the
Standardized Amount (executed between the Hospital and Baker Healthcare Consulting)

To fairly apportion the fees associated with this appeal, services will be billed to all
participants throughout the U. S. and its territories on a pro rata basis, depending upon
each participating provider?s estimated amount in controversy compared to the total
estimated amount in controversy for all participating providers. There may be multiple
PRRB groups formed to challenge this issue. Administratively, however, we will treat all
groups as a single project.

BHC will bill quarterly for Mr. Baker?s consulting services and the legal costs and
expenses incurred on this project at a discounted rate of eighty percent of
standard hourly rates. Dale Baker?s 2012 standard rate is $520 per hour, and Hall
Render attorneys? standard hourly rates range from $495 for the most senior partner to
$195 for new associates. All hourly fees and reasonable expenses for services rendered
by BHC or Hall Render on behalf of BHC shall be paid to BHC.

BHC, Hall Render, and the Association will share a success fee of 13.3% of the
Recovered Amount, to be divided as follows: Association: BHC and Hall Render:
10%. The success fees will apply to all individual years under appeal. For purposes of
this engagement, "Recovered Amount includes any additional reimbursement recovered
in connection with this matter, be it through settlement, administrative resolution,
litigation, adoption of new regulations or enactment of new legislation addressing the
matter, less tees and out-of-pocket expenses. The Recovered Amount will include only
the additional reimbursement obtained retroactively.
