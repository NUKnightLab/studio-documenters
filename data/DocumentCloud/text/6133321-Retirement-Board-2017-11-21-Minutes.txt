Legislative Matters
Mr. Walsh gave a brief update on a potential trailer bill to PA 100-0023 and noted that this would likely be a 2018
initiative. He reported that, to date, the Speaker’s Office has been focused on discussions with the State retirement
systems regarding the defined benefit/defined contribution “hybrid” component of the legislation and that there has
yet to be much discussion regarding the provisions specifically affecting the Laborers’ and Municipal Employees’
Funds. Mr. Walsh also updated the Trustees on the Interceptor provisions and the Assignment of Receipts provisions
and noted that the Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago had discussed draft legislation to
address some of the inconsistencies related to these two items.
Trustee Roa requested that Mr. Walsh re-circulate a letter that was previously sent to Illinois State Representative
Barbara Flynn Curry in November of 2016 which discusses some possible changes to a previous iteration of the
legislation that was ultimately included in PA 100-0023.
Trustee Keane requested some information regarding procedural issues affecting the timing of legislation.
The Board instructed Fund staff, for discussion purposes only, to have the State Legislative Reference Bureau draft
legislation clarify the law regarding the Intercept provision which is part of P.A. 100-0023. Mr. Walsh and the
Trustees thought that the draft legislation could mirror the changes the Fund suggested in the aforementioned letter to
Representative Barbara Flynn Currie. The Trustees asked that the draft legislation be circulated to the Trustees prior
to the December 19, 2017 Board meeting.

Watchlist Recommendations

Background
On November 14, 2017, Staff and Marquette discussed the existing manager watchlist
for the LABF. As part of the discussion, both parties reviewed the rationale for the
following managers being placed on watch:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Ariel Investments Micro Cap Value portfolio being added to the list for
performance reasons (8/18/15 Board meeting)
PIMCO being placed on watch for organizational changes (2/18/14 Board
meeting) and performance reasons (12/10/15 Board meeting)
Entrust being placed on watch for organizational changes (2/23/15 Board
meeting)
Apex Capital (Fiera), and Vontobel being added to the watchlist for
organizational changes (3/22/16 Board meeting)
Keeley being placed on watch for organizational changes (11/22/16 Board
meeting)
Newport Capital (DV Urban Realty Partners I LP) being added to the watchlist for
performance reasons and organizational changes (7/21/09 Board meeting)

Recommendation:
Following discussions with Staff, Marquette is recommending that all of the
aforementioned firms be removed from the watchlist for the following reasons:
•
•

•
•

Ariel Investments Micro Cap Value portfolio – strategy has been phased out of
the portfolio for asset allocation reasons
Apex Capital (Fiera), Keeley, Vontobel, PIMCO, Entrust, and Newport Capital –
enough time has elapsed to note that the organizational concerns that lead to
these managers being placed on watch are not currently viewed as being
material
PIMCO – Performance is no longer a concern
Newport Capital – Nearly all assets have been distributed, removing the
material performance concern

Additionally, Marquette is recommending that ASB Capital Management be added to
the watchlist for performance reasons. Please refer to Marquette’s separate memo on
ASB for additional information.

ASB Allegiance Real Estate Fund Recommendation

Topic
The ASB Allegiance Real Estate Fund (“the Fund”) has underperformed the NFI-ODCE1
benchmark (“benchmark”) over the past seven consecutive quarters and is lagging the
benchmark on a 1, 3, and 5-year basis net of fees as of September 30, 2017. As a result of the
Fund’s poor performance, this memorandum provides a high-level overview of the Fund
including a deep dive into the factors contributing to the underperformance.
Fund Overview
The ASB Allegiance Fund is an open-ended diversified U.S. core real estate fund that invests in
the four main commercial property sectors (retail, office, industrial, & multifamily) stressing the
supply-constrained East and West coast markets. While the fund’s inception dates back to 1984,
with the management change of Robert Bellinger to Portfolio Manager in 2003 the strategy has
been focused on core, supply-constrained, high quality assets. Access to non-core development
& larger assets are typically invested through Joint Ventures. Additionally, the Fund has the
lowest leverage in its peer group, currently 15% as of 9/30/2017.
Robert Bellinger, ASB Real Estate Investments President and CEO, heads the strategy as the
Executive Portfolio Manager along with dedicated ASB Allegiance Fund Portfolio Manager Larry
Braithwaite. With the exception of three Junior Analysts who left the firm to pursue their MBAs
earlier this year, the Allegiance Fund portfolio management team has remained intact with no
major departures over the past several years.

 From an income and appreciation perspective illustrated in exhibits 1 and 2, the Fund’s net
income has delivered slightly below benchmark returns over the last 1, 3, 5, and 10-year
annualized periods. The appreciation returns, however, have been much worse particularly over
the last year with an abysmal 0.2% vs. 3.2% for the benchmark. While the shorter-term
appreciation has struggled to keep up, the long-term 5, and 10-year returns have outperformed
the benchmark with a 7.0% vs. 6.4% and 2.0% vs. -0.4% return, respectively.
There are several structural factors impacting performance including the Fund’s low leverage
which was slightly below 15% at the end of the third quarter of 2017. Leverage alone accounts
for approximately 90 bps of underperformance per annum vs. the benchmark since 2016.
However, ASB remains committed to maintaining lower leverage vs. the benchmark, but aims
to rebalance upwards toward an 18-20% range, just slightly below the benchmark. In an effort
to increase fund leverage, ASB recently sourced two new investments that are scheduled to
close in the fourth quarter where they have added additional leverage. One asset is an office
in Washington D.C. and the other is an industrial building New York.
Another notable impact of underperformance came from the Fund’s high concertation to
gateway markets which have moderated and led to a negative appreciation return in the third
quarter. While this has hurt performance over the past several quarters, the high concentration
helped in 2010 – 2015 as gateway markets recovered much quicker after the financial crises.
As rents have historically appreciated in gateway markets, tenants are pulling back and, as a
result, rent growth and property appreciation has slowed and the investment market has
responded by sharpening their view for expectations. ASB’s exposure to the top 10 gateway
markets within the ODCE is approximately 89% vs. 60% for the benchmark.
Additionally, the Minneapolis office sector has been a weak and poor performing market for
Fund. ASB likes Minneapolis because it has a well-educated population and a solid corporate
company presence, but the market has experienced weakness in fundamentals. The Fund
owns 225 South Sixth Street (Capella Tower office building) which represents an approximate
5% allocation to the Fund based on NAV that has experienced challenges. ASB spent capital
updating the building’s lobby, public space, fitness center, but substantial new supply has
damaged fundamentals resulting in a significant write-down in the asset. Capella office
building is currently a disposition candidate for the portfolio since it has been a drag on the
portfolio.
Recommendation: Alert

Marquette recommends placing the ASB Allegiance Real Estate Fund on “Alert” due
to persistent underperformance since 2016. While the portfolio management team has
been stable with no major departures, the Fund’s seven consecutive quarters of
underperformance has been disappointing and cause for concern. We will continue to
monitor the Fund’s performance and any major changes to the team and or investment
process.
