“In the name of the one God, the beneficent, the merciful, praise belongs to the one
God, the Lord of the worlds. The beneficent, the merciful, master of this day of judgment; thee
alone do we worship and serve and thine aid do we seek. Guide us on the right path, the path
of those upon whom thou hast bestowed favors, not the path of those upon whom thou wrath
is brought down nor of those who go astray. May this body of Commissioners find
