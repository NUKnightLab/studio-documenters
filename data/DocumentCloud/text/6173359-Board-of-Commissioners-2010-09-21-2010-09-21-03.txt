 effective internal control, with respect to federal awards administered by state and local
governments and not-for-profit organizations.
The current contract for independent auditing services will expire on November 9, 2010 and in
an effort to comply with HUD’s requirements, the CHA issued a Request for Proposal (RFP #
10-00552) to procure independent professional auditing required to:
1. Audit CHA’s general purpose financial statements, including the Statement of Net Assets
and Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Fund Net Assets in conformity
with General Accepted Auditing Standards and Government Auditing Standards.
2. Audit CHA’s federal program revenues and expenditures in accordance to OMB Circular
A-133 Audits of States, Local Governments and Non-profit Organizations

Clearinghouse
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The RFP for Internal Auditing Services (RFP #10-00552) was released on June 28, 2010,
advertised in the Chicago Sun Times, Chicago Defender, and El Dia newspaper on various dates.
The solicitation was also sent to five vendors. Twenty four vendors accessed the RFP, with four
(4) proposals received on July 28, 2010. An initial evaluation was done by an evaluation
committee of five (5) staff, after which three (3) firms were determined to be in the competitive
range. Oral discussions were conducted with the 3 firms in the competitive range and the
evaluation team scored the information presented by each firm. Best and final offers were
requested and received from each firm. Based on the evaluation committee scores, and Best and
Final Offers, Ernst & Young was determined to be the best overall respondent whose proposal’s
technical factors and pricing were most advantageous to the CHA.
During the past five years under its previous contract with CHA, E&Y met its contract
requirements with CHA and has performed all tasks expected of the independent auditors. E&Y
utilized expertise from its various audit practices to deliver key solutions to critical accounting
and financial issues on behalf of the CHA. E&Y has readily shown its ability and willingness to
provide independent professional auditing services to the CHA for the contract term, November
10, 2010 through November 11, 2012.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to award form fixed price contract to
Ernst & Young, LLP for the period November 10, 2010 to November 11, 2012 to provide
independent professional auditing services for an amount of $1,420,000 with three additional
one-year options.
