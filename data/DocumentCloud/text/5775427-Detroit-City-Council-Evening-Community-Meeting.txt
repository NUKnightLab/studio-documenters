AGENCY PLAN: MISSION, GOALS AND ACTIVITY SUMMARY
MISSION:
The mission of the City of Detroit’s Planning & Development Department (PDD) is to build a city secure in its future, grounded in its roots and hopeful in its
present state. The vision that supports PDD’s mission is a healthy and beautiful Detroit, built on inclusionary growth, economic opportunity and an atmosphere of
trust.
DESCRIPTION:
Offices within the Planning & Development Department carry these responsibilities in support of the department’s mission and vision:
The Office of Planning and Design provides planning and design leadership and coordination in three city regions (East, Central and West), which achieves
neighborhood stabilization and revitalization and supports the growth of population and jobs.
The Office of Zoning Innovations translates City and neighborhood visions into regulatory language, ordinances and initiatives that guide developmental efforts,
performs design review and oversees the Community Benefits Ordinance process.
The Office of Historic Preservation translates City and neighborhood visions into regulatory language, ordinances and initiatives that guide developmental efforts,
environmental protection efforts, and the preservation of critical historic assets.
The Office of Urban Research and Outreach extracts, compiles, and interprets a large volume of quantitative and qualitative data from databases and
neighborhood stakeholders to measure the performance of PDD’s initiatives and development strategies. It also guides strategic planning, specifically the
development and the implementation of a city Master Plan that captures the City’s long-range vision for development and preservation and land use policies that
support citywide and neighborhood visions for walkable, urban growth.
The Office of Yes! supports the efficient and cost-effective operations of PDD, including management of the Department’s personnel operations and operating
budget, grants, and contracts; its partnerships with key vendors, foundation and university partners; and its large-scale community communications, meetings, and
workshops.
AGENCY GOALS:
Through the Planning & Development Department, the City of Detroit is committed to the following beliefs and values:
1. That every citizen has the right to live in a socially, environmentally, and economically healthy community.
2. That Detroit is blessed with a rich history and tremendous physical assets with opportunities for historic and environmental preservation.
3. That the potential of the City will best be realized by embracing the broadest, most far-reaching and inclusive vision of what is possible.
4. That citizen engagement strengthens decisions and generates confidence in the future.
