Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Metrics
Update on Venous Thromboembolisms (VTEs)
Update on Patient Experience (includes Nursing Update and Environmental Services Update)

Dr. Ronald Wyatt, Chief Quality Officer, provided a regulatory and accreditation update. He stated that
Stroger Hospital had a follow-up survey from a surveyor representing both The Joint Commission (TJC)
and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Stroger Hospital remains accredited; he noted that
the condition-level deficiency was removed, which is very good news. He thanked the executive team,
and in particular, the following individuals: Jarrod Johnson, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital &
Central Campus; Mohammed Abu Realh, Associate Nurse Executive, Hospital-Based Services; Sonya
Watkins, System Director, Regulatory Affairs and Accreditation; the Command Center team; the
Operating Room team; and the Environmental Services team. He stated that Stroger Hospital is now less
than 18 months from being back in the window for the next TJC visit, so staff will continue to have
ongoing readiness activities. They will plan internal mock surveys, and will prepare for TJC’s visit to
Provident Hospital. The Committee expressed their gratitude to staff for their hard work towards this
major achievement.

Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
During the discussion of the metrics, Director Driscoll stated that, although it is good to see the graphs, it
is also important to see the actual numbers for Hospital Acquired Infections per quarter and by infection.
Ms. Merryweather inquired regarding quality measurement for the CountyCare Health Plan. Dr. John Jay
Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set
(HEDIS) measures are oftentimes process measures of care, and some of them are outcome measures. The
administration has shared with the Board how the organization is doing with HEDIS measures in the Plan
and in the System as a provider. Additionally, there is an annual satisfaction survey that is sent to the Plan
members; this is a standardized survey required by the State to get feedback on members’ perception of
how good the Plan is. He stated that he can bring information on that subject back to the Committee; he
also noted that, because the Board needs to have a better understanding of how the Plan is doing from a
quality standpoint, he will go back and huddle with his team to further contemplate the best way to do this.
During the Update on Patient Experience, Mr. Abu Realh provided an overview of the materials for the
Nursing Update, and Mr. Johnson reviewed the materials relating to Environmental Services. Information
contained in the presentation included the following subjects:
Patient Experience Update
 Contributing factors to current limited patient experience improvement
 Solutions
 Nursing Update
o Nursing Action Plan Summary
 Environmental Services (EVS) Update
o Scope of Engagement
o Focused Highlights: EVS

PATIENT EXPERIENCE UPDATE

Page 9 of 34

QPS Committee I October 19, 2018

 Contributing Factors to current limited patient
Experience improvement…(the “whys”)
• Workforce engagement is a continuous process.
• The pace of correction of experience-related and
well-understood operational problems, ex. waiting,
phone access, cleanliness will continue to be
primary drivers of the efforts.
• Culture transformation and individual change
happen slowly.
• Re HCAHPS scores, limited improvements are only
possible through a “staggered approach” and a
five-year plan.

Page 10 of 34

QPS Committee I October 19, 2018

 Solutions
•
•

Setting customer service standards is just the beginning.
Continue to share data reports – (Quarterly to approx. 25 staff members and
monthly to approx. 40 staff)
• Survey scores are important but limited indicators without associated QI
action (access to PG website Feb-Aug 2018 – 9 CCHHS staff per month)
Potential next steps:
Person and Care-giver Advisory Council
QI training PDSA, SBAR etc.)
QI pilot projects
Increasing staff engagement
Annual training inclusion on LMS – customer service
standards/tools
• It’s beyond training – change is local/“in the neighborhoods” – units, sites,
departments: based on local champions, management skill-building,
accountability and sustainability.

Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
B. Metrics (Attachment #2)
Dr. Wyatt provided an overview of the metrics. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Additionally, he provided a sample of the draft dashboard of metrics that is currently being created and
refined (included in Attachment #2).
During the discussion of the Stroger Hospital safety measure on falls with injury, Director Driscoll
inquired whether root cause analyses are done when these occur. Dr. Wyatt responded that he was not
certain, but will take a closer look at that.
During the review of the draft dashboard, Director Driscoll requested that when the Committee receives
this type of safety information, they should also receive information on what the organization is doing to
move towards zero events occurring. Information should include whether root cause analyses have been
done and the outcomes of those analyses, and what the corrective action plan is.
During the review of the measure on Depression Screening Referral Management, it was noted that the
graph will be revised to a more reader-friendly version.
Director Driscoll requested that, from time to time, the Committee receive a deeper dive into the major
quality initiatives of the different clinical departments and other areas. Additionally, she reiterated her
request made at a previous meeting to receive copies of the minutes of the hospitals’ internal quality
committee meetings. Dr. Shannon indicated that he will work to determine the best way to address her
request regarding the internal quality committee meeting minutes.
Director Junge requested that the Committee begin receiving regular reports of quality indicators for the
correctional area. Dr. Shannon noted that the Committee had sporadically received those reports in the
past; at that time, because it involved the subject of litigation, reporting was limited.
Director Suleiman Gonzalez recommended that a schedule and plan for the year be developed for deep
dive presentations as referred to earlier in the meeting by Director Driscoll. Additionally, given that the
organization in the process of completing the activities relating to the survey by representatives of TJC,
the Committee should continue to monitor the status of matters that emerged from the survey until the
Committee sees the progress needed to meet compliance.
