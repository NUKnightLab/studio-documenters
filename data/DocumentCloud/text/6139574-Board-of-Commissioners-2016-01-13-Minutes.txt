PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CELEBRATING THE SOOTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DOMINICAN ORDER
WHEREAS, 800 years ago St. Dominic was inspired to raise up a new religious order to preach for the

between faith and reason; and
WHEREAS, the four pillars of Dominican life are preaching, prayer, study, and community; and

philosophers, such as St. Albert and St. Thomas Aquinas; mystics, such as St. Catherine of Siena and

de Porres and St. Agnes ofMontepulciano; refonners, such as St. Antoninus and Pope Pius V; and prophetic
preachers, such as St. Vincent Ferrer and Gustavo Gutierrez; and

Dominican Sisters in the early 1900s attended colleges and universities in increasing numbers at home and

that every generation needs to hear afresh the message of God' s love and friendship with humanity; and
WHEREAS, St. Vincent Ferrer Church in River Forest will join Dominican churches and shrines around
the world in providing lectures and other special events throughout 2016 to commemorate the 800-year

COMMEMORATING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF
THE HONORABLE MARJORIE COLLENS
WHEREAS, Marjorie Collens represented some of the best qualities of citizenship and humanity through
her life-long work as a supporter of the arts, community leader and elected official. When she died in early
December she left behind a fami ly, countless friends and a community enriched for having known her; and
WHEREAS, Marjorie Callens, spent her early years in Albany Park. She graduated from Von Steuben
High School and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where she got a bachelor's degree
and met her husband, Lewis Collens; and
WHEREAS, Marjorie Callens was a remarkably talented woman whose intelligence and leadership
qualities singled her out for distinction. Marjorie Collens was elected by the voters of Evanston's seventh
ward to be their aldennan. She diligently represented the ward from to 1984 to 199 1 and will long be
remembered for her support of the acquisition of property by the city in what became the Evanston Research
Park. Her support promoting new downtown commercial and residential development sparked a
renaissance in the city 's downtown ; and

tenns of office and spanned decades. She was wam1ly received when she returned to the City Council

Page 12 of 178

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

January 13, 2016

WHEREAS, Marjorie Collens had the unique ability to regularly achieve her goals without rancor and, as
a result was genuinely admired and respected by her peers. She fonned and nurtured strong relationships
and worked to resolve long standing issues between the city and its two largest institutions, Northwestern
University and Evanston Hospital, both of which were located in the seventh ward; and
WHEREAS, Marjorie Collens was a longtime admirer and pioneer in the area of arts and education. She
recognized the vital role that the arts play in civic life. She played a major role in the effort to start what is
now ChiArts, the Chicago High School for the Arts. The idea for the school grew out of the realization that
a chief reason for a lack of diversity on Chicago music stages was the lack of a public pre-professional arts
high school. The school serves artistically gifted, diverse Chicago high school students, provides intensive
pre-professional training in the arts combined with a comprehensive college preparatory curriculum and
can be credited with the improvement and enhancement of countless lives; and
WHEREAS, Marjorie Collens later moved to Chicago with her husband when he was selected to lead the
Illinois Institute of Technology as its president. She tirelessly supported the university in numerous
development activities and brought her leadership skills to the boards of the Chicago Foundation for
Women, Chicago's public radio station WBEZ and the Lincoln Park Zoo; and

appointment to join the board of the Cook County Health and Hospital System; and later encouraged him
to take on the further responsibilities of chairing the finance committee of that board and graciously
accepted the additional loss of his time; and
WHEREAS, Marjorie Collens served as a board member and later chaired the board of Hubbard Street
Dance Chicago. Hubbard Street is widely viewed to be one of the most original forces in contemporary
dance today and is thriving in its 38th year. While on the board, she championed several groundbreaking
initiatives. She promoted a collaboration among architecture students, choreographers and dancers for a
performance by the dance company at the Illinoi s Institute for Technology's S.R. Crown Hall, which was
designed by famed architect Mies van der Rohe. She promoted the move to a new location at the corner of
Jackson Boulevard and Racine A venue, and later championed a new design for the fa<;:ade; and
WHEREAS, the community has Jost a great friend in Marjorie Collens. She will also be sorely missed by
her friends, neighbors and colleagues. Her loss will be felt most acutely by her husband of over 50 years,
Lewis Collens and their son Steven.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the extraordinary life of Marjorie Collens and
herewith expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable contributions she has made to the Citizens of
Cook County, Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be tendered to the family of

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

January 13, 2016

WHEREAS, Roger Pascal served as general counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois for
thirty years and as a partner at Schiff, Hardin LLP for fifty years; and
WHEREAS, Roger Pascal's legal legacy is lengthy and cannot be overstated. He will long be remembered
in particular for his challenge to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services which brought
about important changes for those in the foster care system and for creating new and important legal
doctrines that had a major impact on trade-secrets case law; and
WHEREAS, Roger Pascal, in addition to being a highly successful litigator and chair of his law firm's
litigation practice took seriously his commitment to pro bono work. His work as legal counsel to the
America Civil Liberties Union brought about profound and lasting reform that has expanded nationwide.
One of his major victories was the decentralization of high-rise public housing in Chicago; his suit brought
into use the Gautreaux process, now a national model for scattered site, low-density public housing. He
successfully led the challenge to conditions at Illinois state psychiatric hospitals, and challenged the abusive
and unlawful detention of a legal resident following the terrorist attacks of September 11th (9/ 11 /2001 ). His
work challenging government watch lists and the repeated, lengthy, and abusive detentions of American
citizens reentering the U.S made him nothing short oflegendary; and
WHEREAS, Roger Pascal's commitment to justice, due process, and the future of the legal profession
inspired his participation in numerous organizations. He served on the board of the Public Interest Law
Initiative and the Schiff Hardin/Howard Area Community Center Legal Clinic, which he helped establish
and where he served regular shifts for many years. He also helped create the James B. Moran Center for
Youth Advocacy, an organization that provides low income Evanston youth and their families with legal
and social work services. Countless lives have been improved as a direct result of the important work of
each of these organizations; and
WHEREAS, Roger Pascal and his wife Missy were leaders in the city of Evanston and the Chicago
neighborhood of Rogers Park on any issue that improved the quality of life, especially for young people;
and
WHEREAS, Roger Pascal not only volunteered his considerable legal abilities he also volunteered his
talents as a pilot, sharing his love of aviation in a program that gives urban children their first experiences
of flight. He also regularly flew medical missions with LifeLine Pilots transporting patients to hospitals
across the country; and
WHEREAS, Roger Pascal was a man with many distinct passions. He was a lover and supporter of jazz.
He perfonned with his band the Rip Chords and served on the board of the Jazz Institute of Chicago. He
and his wife Martha were passionate scuba divers; his office was decorated with his photos of exotic fish.
He was a talented b aker who regularly shared with family and friends his homemade bread; and
WHEREAS, Roger Pascal was the beloved husband of Martha Pascal and the loving father of three:
Deborah, Diane, and David; grandchildren Sam and Bennett Pascal, and Sofia Hogue; and his brothers,
Charles and Ross Pascal.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County who he served dutifully, commemorates the life of Roger

HONORING THE SHABBONA PARK SAINTS PEE WEE FOOTBALL TEAM AND THE 11
Y.O. SHABBONA PARK SAINTS CHEERLEADER SQUAD, FOR THEIR AMAZING 2015
SEASON AND NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP TITLES
WHEREAS, the Shabbona Park Saints Pee Wee football team started the 2015 season with a burning desire
to bring home a National Championship Title, which had escaped them for the past two (2) years; and
WHEREAS, the season ' s game opening's loss against Tri City, although overwhelming, strengthened the
team members' commitment to their goals and to undertaking the challenging road to victory; and
WHEREAS, after an exciting triumph against Park Ridge brought the team closer to finding their groove,
a new trial and final lesson was waiting for them. On week three (3) of the season, during a nail biting game

Page 18of178

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

January 13, 2016

against the Addison Cowboys, where the parents chanted, the crowd roared and the team fought harder than
ever, several tough penalties cost them the game; and
WHEREAS, the remainder of the regular season, brought the sweet feeling of reaching the playoffs to a
team that remained undefeated against Wildwood, Joliet, Leyden, Plainfield, and Westchester. These young
warriors were now three (3) games away from the Chicagoland United Youth Football League (UYFL) Pee
Wee Title; and
WHEREAS, three (3) more amazing victories against Plainfield, Addison and Homewood, gave them the
chance to bring home the National Title! The coaches prepared the players over the next three (3) weeks.
A true team had formed, they were family and they were ready; and
WHEREAS, the National Title would take them through three (3) more games during a week in Florida,
games that brought excitement, some disappointment, and great expectations. The final encounter came
down to the last quarter. The Shabbona Park Saints Pee Wee football team defeated the Hornets 2 I -20,
bringing the year to a perfect ending. They are now the UYFL Pee Wee Division National Champions; and
WHEREAS, while focusing on learning spirited cheerleading routines for the competition for their own
titles, the 11 Y.O. Shabbona Park Saints Cheerleading Squad, comprised of mostly new members, attended
and cheered at every one of the Shabbona Park Saints Pee Wee football games; and
WHEREAS , just two (2) days after securing a spot at Nationals in Tampa, the Cheerleading Squad's
beloved head coach, "Coach Amy" passed away unexpectedly, leaving the squad without a coach and
devastated by the loss; and
WHEREAS, the squad members unanimously decided that "Coach Amy" would want them to finish what
they had begun, and enlisted the help of the mother of one of their members who had been a previous
cheerleading coach and who agreed to step into the role of the head coach. The new head coach and the
assistant coaches provided their knowledge and unconditional support to their team, working through
several emotional breakdowns at every practice; and
WHEREAS, on the day of Coach Amy's funeral, the squad cheered for their Pee-Wee football team during
the National Championship football game, inspiring them to come from behind to win by one point. Several
of the boys and their parents acknowledged that the encouragement that the cheerleading squad gave to
them during the game helped to motivate them even more onto the win; and
WHEREAS, at the Cheerleading Nationals Competition, the Shabbona Park Saints 1 I Y.O. cheerleading
squad, having overcome true adversity, once again became the little team that could and won the National
Title. After their performance, each squad member received a picture of " Coach Amy" holding a team
photo of the 11 Y.O. cheerleading squad that had been taken four (4) weeks earlier at the regional
competition. It was clear that this squad was destined to be National Champions. " Coach Amy" had been
with them the entire time; and
WHEREAS, these two amazing teams have learned that there is more to playing sports than just competing.
They were taught discipline, sportsmanship, hard work, reliability, how to make sacrifices and how to deal
with failure. Most importantly, they learned to work together and build confidence in themselves and their

teammat es. The 20 15 season brought many upÂ·sand downÂ·s. tough games and tougher losses. These young
athletes also learned that in sports, as in all thi ngs in life, they must never give up. It is with that drive and
dreams that these two teams find themselves champions; thanks to their dedication, determination and the
uncompromising pursuit of their dreams.

NOW, T HEREFORE, BE IT RESOLV ED, that the President and Members of the Cook County Board
of Commi ssioners do hereby recognize the incredible odds that the Shabbona Park Saints Pee Wee Team

(kcybonrdi st), Peter Cetera (bassist), and the late Terry Kath (guitarist), fonned a group with one dream: to
integrate all the musical di versity from their beloved city and weave a new sound-a rock ' nÂ· roll band with
horns; and

WH EREAS, after playing locally and then in Los Angeles, the band, The Chicago Transit Authority (later
shortened to C hi cago), recorded its first album in 1969. They had amassed so much material by then they
decided to make a statement by debuting with a double album; and
WH EREAS, although AM radio was nowhere near ready for their music and the length of their songs, the
album was an underground hit, embraced by FM radio and college students; and
WHEREAS, the album Chicago 11 drew for inspiration classical music on the one hand and the volatile
political situation unfolding in their city and around the country on the other; and
WH EREAS, to get a single from Chicago II playable on AM radio, the label (Columbia) excerpted two
songs. " Ma ke Me Smile" and "Colour My World," from Pankow' s 13-minute suite, " Ballet for a Girl in
Buchannon," and released them as the two sides of a single. The single reached the Top 10 while Chicago
II immediately went gold; and
WHEREAS, after their second hit, "25 or 6 to 4," they decided to try to re-stimulate interest in their first
album, and released "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?," which became their third Top 10 hit
in a row by the start of 1971; and
WHEREAS, the year 1975 marked an early commercial peak in Chicago's career, a year during which the
band scored its fourth straight Number 1 album, all its previous albums were back in the charts, and its
worldwide record sales for this single year were a staggering 20 million copies; and
WHEREAS, the big hit from their new album, Chicago X, released in 1976, was a song that barely made
the final cut. Cetera' s " If You Leave Me Now" came about only after they decided they needed one more
song. The song became Chicago's first Billboard singles topper and also topped charts around the world;
and
WHEREAS, part of the band 's longevity can be attributed to its efforts to value the group effort over
individual egos, which is reflected in the name, the logo, and the facelessness of the first eleven album
covers; and
WHEREAS, for the last several decades, Chicago has recorded and toured with great success and continues
to be ambassadors for their beloved hometown, carrying the city' s name with pride and dignity around the
world; and
W HEREAS, considered one of the longest running and most successful pop/rock ' n' roll groups in history,
Chicago is the highest charting American band in Billboard magazine' s list of Top I 00 artists of all time,
coming in at Number 13; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOL UTION OF THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS CALLING ON GOVE RNOR BRUCE
RAUN ER TO REQUIRE THE APPOINTM ENT OF A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN ALL CASES
INVOLVING POLICE SHOOTINGS OF UNARMED CIVILIANS IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
WHEREAS, in the summer of 2015 , Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York issued an executive order
requiring the appointment of a Special Prosecutor for all cases involving police shootings of unanned
civilians, a nd in so doing, stated, " A criminal justice system doesn ' t work without trust" ; and
WHEREAS, in Chicago and Cook County, trust in law enforcement and the impartiality of the criminal
justice system has been significantly eroded by a series of police shootings of unarmed civilians; and
WHEREAS, it is a common practice of the Cook County State's Attorney, as codified in the Cook County
Code of Ordinances, to work cooperatively with and rely upon the Chicago Police Department to
investigate, gather evidence, and build cases against criminal defendants; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, Assistant State's Attorneys frequently rely upon police officers as witnesses
at tria l, and the success of many prosecutions by the Cook County State's Attorney hinges upon police
officer testimony; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County State's Attorney, as is the case with prosecutors throughout the State of
Illinois, is dependent upon the cooperation of police officers in order to fulfill the basic functions of the
office; and
WHEREAS, the dependence of the Cook County State' s Attorney's office upon the Chicago Police
Department in order to conduct its basic functions raises legitimate and pervasive concerns about the ability
of the State's Attorney to be objective when weighing the potential prosecution ofa Chicago Police Officer;
and
WHEREAS, concerns about prosecutoria l objectivity are especially problematic when it comes to cases
involving police shootings ofunanned civilians; and
WHEREAS, a critical step in restoring trust in Cook County's criminal j ustice system is to ensure
prosecutorial objectivity in cases involving police shootings of unanned civilians; and
WHEREAS, the example provided by Governor Cuomo in the State of New York demonstrates that, while
comprehensive refonn of community-law enforcement relations will take time, there are simple steps that
can be taken in the short term to restore public faith in Cook County's criminal j ustice system; and
WHEREAS, one such simple step would be the issuance of an executive order by the Governor of Illinois
to require a special prosecutor in all cases involving the shooting of unanned civilians by police officers.

tile a petition alleging that the State' s Attorney is unable to fulfill her duties; and

the position of having to defend the impartiality of the State 's Attorney' s Office in prosecuting Officer Van
Dyke; and

WI-I ERE AS, the State of Illinois has recogni zed the importance of organ donation by providing the
opportunity for paid leave to State employees who donate an organ or bone marrow; and

with the donation and protect employees from retaliation for taking leave to donate an organ by passing
legislation providing job-protected, paid leave to employees who donate organs or bone marrow; and
WHEREAS, Cook County currently does not provide job-protected, paid leave for the purpose of organ or
bone marrow donation, necessitating employees to use their accrued sick and vacation leave or take unpaid
personal leave, if eligible; and
WHEREAS , in order to offset the incidental costs associated with donation and protect employees from
retaliation for taking a leave of absence to donate an organ, all Cook County agencies and offices should
afford paid leave to employees who donate organs or bone marrow; and

WHEREAS, the proposed policy would be available to all eligible Cook County employees (employed
with the County for at least twelve (12) months) who donate organs or donate bone marrow via surgical
aspiration or non- surgical apheresis; and
WHEREAS, the risk of complications and death, as well as the burden to the donor in terms of recovery
time, pain, and suffering is lowest for apheresis donation and greatest for organ donation; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates bone marrow via non-surgical apheresis on or after
September I, 2015 would receive five (5) days of paid leave within a twelve ( 12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates bone marrow via surgical aspiration on or after September
I, 2015 would receive fifteen (15) days of paid leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee who donates an organ on or after September 1, 2015 would receive
thirty (30) days of paid donor leave within a twelve (12) month period; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee that donates an organ as of January I, 2015, that by necessity used their
accrued sick and vacation leave or took unpaid leave may recover that time under this policy but may not
exceed the thirty (30) days ofoaid donor leave within a twelve (12) month period; and an eligible employee
that donated an organ between January I. 2015 and August 31, 2015 that by necessity used his or her
accrued paid leave time to recover from said donation may recover his or her paid leave time that may have
been used for such organ donation in the manner directed in the Organ Donor Leave Policy; and
WHEREAS, an eligible employee that donates an organ as of January I, 2015, that by necessity used their
accrued sick and vacation leave or took unpaid leave may recover that time under this policy but may not
exceed the thirty (30) days of paid donor leave within a twelve ( 12) month period and an eligible employee
