Janet Anderson, 

Director, General Services Department
Detroit Parks and Recreation Division
18100 Meyers Road Lower Level
Detroit, Michigan 48235

Dear Dr. Anderson:

On behalf of myself, Barry Lehr, I am writing to offer the donation of the sculpture entitled ?Ascension?
which I created in 1971, to the City of Detroit to be installed in Detroit?s Palmer Park. The costs of the
installation are being borne by the City of Detroit.

These improvements will take place on a date to be determined by the City of Detroit. I have worked with
community representatives from People for Palmer Park to ensure these improvements are desired.

The City of Detroit will have responsibility to maintain the sculpture. I recommend that any maintenance
of this artwork be executed by Giorgio Gikas, Venus Bronze Works, 1340] Mt Elliott St, Detroit, MI
48212, where previous restoration and repair work has been completed.

?Ascension? is a tall, slender, steel construction created by artist Barry Lehr in 1971 in Michigan. The
sculpture is composed of three curved, hollow steel slabs of the same basic shape, stacked vertically on an
internal structural mast. The slabs are rotated and permanently set at different angles. The
sculpture was originally painted 1969-1970 Chevrolet Daytona Yellow lacquer. ?Ascension? is
approximately 12 ft tall 5 ft wide and weighs about 700 pounds.

As a gift, the ownership rights to the sculpture will be transferred entirely to the city. Any rights to the
soulpture, by the artists, or their descendants will be transferred in their entirety to the City of Detroit.

We respectfully request your authorization to accept and install the sculpture ?Ascension?, with a waiver
of reconsideration.



Sincerely,

Barry ehr
Artist/Donor
