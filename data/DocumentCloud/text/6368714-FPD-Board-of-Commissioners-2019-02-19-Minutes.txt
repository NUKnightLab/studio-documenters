revenues over the past 10 years; and
WHEREAS, Brookfield Zoo provides crucial community programming, including early childhood
natureplay activities, an elementary and junior high science program hosted at community libraries, and a

District(s): Districtwide
Summary: The Forest Preserves requests authorization to enter into a contract with AT&T, to bundle
telephone service into a program offered called Easy Rate. The Easy Rate program is recommended for
telephone service primarily used for local calling and with relatively low usage. The new agreement will
save the Forest Preserves approximately $163,180.00 annually. The term of the contract is for
three-years.
As background, the Forest Preserves currently uses 241 AT&T phone lines that are of older technology
using a voice-grade telephone service employing analog signal transmission over copper lines. This
service was installed primarily at remote locations, such as maintenance yards, fueling stations, aquatic
centers, and campgrounds, which are not connected to the County-wide telephone system.
The Easy Rate program will be combined with the County’s existing Master Discount agreement (MDA)
with AT&T to substantially reduce the cost per telephone line. With this new program, line rates will be
reduced from an average of $91.62 per month to $35.20 per month after the MDA is applied.
