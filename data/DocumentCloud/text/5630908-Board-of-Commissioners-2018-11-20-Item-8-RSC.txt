Background
The Resident Service Coordination program links CHA senior residents to the social services and
opportunities necessary to maintain a stable and high quality of life. The Resident Service
Coordinator (RSC) fosters an environment conducive to aging in place that is welcoming to
active seniors, as well as those needing more support. RSCs are responsible for linking
individual seniors to supportive services, as well as planning and coordinating events and
activities that are open to all seniors in each building. Historically, the Resident Service

 Coordination program has been imbedded in CHA private property management firm contracts,
however based upon internal analysis, it was determined that this program is better aligned
with the mission of Resident Services and should be supported by agencies whose core business
and experience includes providing high quality senior services.
All 56 senior buildings in CHA’s north, central and south regions will receive customized
services. There are approximately 9,400 senior designated units throughout CHA’s service area,
which approximately 54 RSCs will serve.
Procurement Process
• CHA issued RFP Event No. 2394 on November 20, 2017 requesting qualified firms to
provide Resident Service Coordination program services for CHA senior residents; the
deadline for proposal submission was December 20, 2017.
• Seven (7) proposals were submitted and scored by the evaluation committee; four (4)
were determined to be in the competitive range.
• Proposals were evaluated by a five (5) person committee, based on the following criteria:
o Approach and Work Plan (maximum 50 points)
o Experience and Past Performance (maximum 20 points)
o Qualifications of Key Personnel (maximum 10 points)
o M/W/DBE and Section 3 Hiring Plan (maximum 10 points)
o Proposed Fees (maximum 10 points)
Vendor Information
Catholic Charities fulfills the mission of charity to anyone in need by providing services that
strengthen and support individuals, families and communities based on the value and dignity of
human life. Catholic Charities currently provides service coordination for seniors in 19 of its U.S.
