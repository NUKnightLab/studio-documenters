The 2019 River Days will utilize the services of Riverfront Security with support from a
private security company to adequately secure the 2019 festival. This security plan will
secure all barricades, stages, crowd control, parking areas, production compound,
carnival and festival elements in and around the River Days. These security groups will
work directly with Detroit Police Department and Detroit Fire Department to ensure a
safe and secure event.

Private Medical Plan

The 2019 River Days will utilize a private medical (Hart Medical) and EMS provider for
the downtown festival. The Medical Provider will have an on?site command center in
which to work from for the duration of the 2019 River Days Event. The Medical Provider
will work directly with Festival Management, Riverfront Security, the Detroit Fire
Department and the Detroit Police Department, and will provide a list of commanding
supervisors, along with contact information to the DF and the DPD supervisors.

Medical Response Plan

Medical Provider will provide the Orr-Site Emergency Medical Services for the 2019
River Days.

Medical Provider will be in operation on Friday June 21, 2019 at the River Days. Medical
Provider will have an Ambulance stationed at the Festival. In addition to the ambulances,
Medical Provider will have two (2) EMS personnel available in each sector of River
Days.

Medical Provider will position its Command Center in the operations area of the Festival
and will invite the City of Detroit to station an EMS of?cer in command center for
coordinated deployment. The Command Center will be up and running at the scheduled
times of the Festival. Medical Provider will utilize one operator to staff the Command
Center and communicate with all services involved in the execution of the Festival.
Medical Provider will have direct communication with the Festival Management,
Riverfront Security, Detroit Police and all Medical Ambulance and Sector Teams. In the
event that a large incident occurs during the 2019 River Days, it is requested that Detroit

RE: RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO
INVESTIGATE THE NEED FOR SPECIAL RULES FOR THE USE OF VESSELS AND

WATERSPORT EQUIPMENT ALONG THE DETROIT RIVER

Council member Janee Ayers requested that the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) draft a
resolution requesting the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to investigate a need for

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

RESOLVED,

RESOLVED,

According to the Michigan of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (PA
451 of 1994), local governmental units are prohibited from creating or authorizing any
local ordinances regulating waterways or the use of watercrafts within their jurisdiction,
without obtaining permission from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources
and

Section 324.081 12 of the Act includes a provision that allows local municipalities to
request assistance from the DNR, by sending an of?cial resolution to the DNR. The
resolution will initiate an investigation by the DNR to determine if a local governmental
agency has a need for special rules to regulate the use of vessels, water skis, surfboards,
or similar devices on their waterways; and

The purpose of the investigation is to determine the viability of a local ordinance. All
?ndings will be compiled into a preliminary report, accompanied with a preliminary
recommendation to the concerned local municipality. Within 90 days of holding a local
public hearing, the DNR will make a ?nal decision on whether or not it should propose a
new local ordinance, make changes to an existing local ordinance, or deny the request to
draft any special rules; NOW THEREFORE, BE IT

Detroit City Council is requesting that the Michigan Department of Natural Resources
investigate the need for special rules for the use of vessels and watersport equipment
along ?The Detroit River? and ?The Edison Sault Power Canal? system, pursuant to The
Michigan Natural Resources Environmental Protection Act. BE IT FURTHER

The City Clerk is directed to send a copy of this resolution to Governor Whitmer, Mayor
Duggan, Detroit's state lobbyist Ken Cole, The Department of Natural Resources, and
The Michigan State Waterways Commission.
