 GENERAL BACKGROUND
The CHA must annually renew its insurance coverage for General Liability, Excess Liability,
Public Officials Liability, All Risk Property, Employed Lawyers Errors and Omissions Liability,
Employment Practices Liability, Auto Liability, Crime and Fiduciary Liability. HUD previously
authorized the CHA to have its insurance broker of record competitively solicit bids on the
CHA’s behalf for all forthcoming insurance procurements.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
Aon directly and indirectly (through one wholesaler) solicited requests for insurance premium
quotes from 16 carriers (most with the ability to quote multiple lines of coverage) on June 29,
2010 and requested that their quotes be received by Aon on July 15, 2010. Aon received quotes
from many new carriers with only the property carriers and auto carrier remaining the same.
After reviewing the responses, Aon and CHA’s Risk Management Department recommend the
insurers listed in the table below to provide the required insurance coverage for CHA for the
period October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011. The recommended awards to these carriers
maintain the same policy limits and retention levels for all lines except for Employment Practices
Insurance which had the retention decreased from $250,000 to $150,000 and Public Officials
Liability which now has $20MM in dedicated limits.

 This year’s insurance renewal was one of great change. The soft insurance market combined
with one of the incumbent carriers refusal to quote, resulted in many new carriers quoting greatly
reduced premiums. Under the property program, Total Insurable Values were increased .5%
which still resulted in cost savings of 3%. Excess Liability was restructured with only General
and Auto Liability sharing the Excess limit of $19MM and Public Officials Liability now has
dedicated limits of $20MM instead of sharing the $19MM limits under the Excess Liability
coverage. This restructuring resulted in savings of $187,349. The Authority was able to take
advantage of the soft insurance market and marketing skills of Aon, for an overall savings of
18% or $247,368.
Since insurance coverage is designated by HUD as a supply & delivery product, Section 3
requirements are not applicable to this procurement. In addition, MBE/WBE/DBE participation
has been waived as there currently is no MBE/WBE/DBE insurance company which can meet
the standard criteria set forth by CHA, which is a minimum rating of “A” by the A.M. Best
Rating Guide.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to purchase
the referenced insurance coverage for the period of October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011
from the listed insurance carriers for the renewal premiums in the table above.
