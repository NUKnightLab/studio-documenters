Question: Do we address the use of personal credit cards for Agency
business in our policies?
Answer: Yes, our travel policy states that to the extent practicable, NOACA
should pay directly for airfare, hotels, and registrations.
• Frequent flyer miles earned on Agency business can be used for other
agency business trips but not for personal use.
•

For expenses unable to be charged to NOACA’s credit card (Taxi’s, etc.),
employees may retain the benefits of a credit card reward program unless
it results in a higher cost to the agency or where reimbursement is sought
for an amount greater than the amount billed due to a credit card
discount.
