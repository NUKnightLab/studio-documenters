VETOES
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 22, 2009 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
In accordance with the authority granted to me by section 2-6008 of the Counties Code and for the
reasons stated herein, I hereby transmit to you my veto of an amendment made to the Home Rule County
Retailers' Occupation Tax (Chapter 74 Taxation, Article IV, Sections 74-150 through 74-152) passed by
the Board of Commissioners on May 19, 2009. Please place my veto message on the agenda for the next
meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, June 2, 2009.

1678

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Please be advised that I am exercising my veto authority as President of the Board of Commissioners and
hereby veto Item No. 5 from the May 19, 2009, Cook County Board Meeting Agenda wherein the Cook
County Board of Commissioners amended the Home Rule County Retailers' Occupation Tax reducing the
retailers' occupation tax to 1% effective, January 1, 2010 and further reducing said tax to .75% effective,
January 1, 2011.
As indicated to the Board of Commissioners on May 19, 2009 and evidenced by my own proposal, I
support reducing the County’s sales tax; however I object to radical reductions without understanding the
ramifications of such action. While I hereby veto the action of the Board of Commissioners on May 19,
2009, I continue to urge the Board of Commissioners to work with me and pass a reduction in the
County’s sales tax that is viable and made at the appropriate intervals with a complete understanding of
the revenues needed to fund County services.
I remain committed to continue to address this issue and reconsider reductions in the sales tax in a
responsible manner before the October 1, 2009 statutory deadline to alter the sales tax rate beginning
January 1, 2010.
For these reasons I urge you to reconsider your support of the repeal of the Cook County Retailers'
Occupation Tax.

following amendments:

1683

1)

Provides explicit authority to designate bonds as “Build America Bonds” as provided for in

2)

An increase in the stated maturity date to 30 years, which will allow the County to maximize
savings under the “Build America Bond” provisions.

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners (the “Board”) of The County of Cook, Illinois (the

providing for the issuance of one or more series of General Obligation Bonds of The County of Cook,

certain County construction, acquisition and equipment projects, being the Public Safety Funds Project,
the Health Fund Project, the Corporate Fund Project and the Capital Equipment Project (being,
collectively, the “Projects”); and
WHEREAS, the Board has heretofore previously amended the Master Bond Ordinance so as to limit the
aggregate amount of Project Bonds to be issued in 2009 for the Projects; and
WHEREAS, since the adoption date of the Master Bond Ordinance, Congress has enacted the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Stimulus Act”), which permits state or local governments
to obtain certain tax advantages when issuing certain taxable obligations, referred to as “Build America
Bonds,” to finance governmental projects; and

1684

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
WHEREAS, the Board has heretofore and it is hereby expressly determined that it is advisable and
necessary to amend the Master Bond Ordinance to maximize certain of the tax advantages as allowed
under the Stimulus Act as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Board of Commissioners of The County of Cook,
Illinois, as follows:
Section 1.

Definitions.

A portion of Section 1.B. of the Master Bond Ordinance is hereby supplemented and amended, said
supplemented and amended portion of Section 1.B. to read as follows:
“Build America Bonds” means taxable bonds authorized by the Stimulus Act and as so
designated pursuant to this Ordinance, the interest on which, but for Section 54AA of the Code, would be
excludable from gross income of the owners thereof under the Code for federal income tax purposes.
“Business Day” means any day other than a day on which banks in New York, New York,
Chicago, Illinois, or the city in which the applicable Escrow Agent or Trustee maintains an office
designated for the purpose, are required or authorized to close.
“Extraordinary Event” means a change that has occurred to Section 54AA or 6431 of the Code
(as such sections were added by Section 1531 of the Stimulus Act, pertaining to Build America Bonds) or
there is any guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury with
respect to such sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States
Treasury, pursuant to which the County’s 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury is
reduced or eliminated, and which is not the result of any act or omission by the County to satisfy the
requirements to qualify to receive the 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury.
“Qualified Build America Bonds” means Build America Bonds that are “qualified bonds” within
the meaning of Section 54AA(g) of the Code, for which an issuer is entitled to apply to receive payments
equal to 35% of the interest payable on such bonds on any interest payment date pursuant to Section 6431
of the Code.
“Stimulus Act” means the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-5,
123 Stat. 115 (2009), enacted February 17, 2009.
“Tax Exempt” means, with respect to the Bonds, the status of interest paid and received thereon
as excludable from the gross income of the owners thereof under the Code for federal income tax
purposes, except to the extent that such interest is taken into account in computing an adjustment used in
determining the alternative minimum tax for certain corporations. For purposes of Sections 13 through
17 herein, the term Tax Exempt shall be deemed to include Bonds issued as Build America Bonds.
“Treasury Rate” means as of any redemption date, the yield to maturity as of such redemption
date of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most
recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) that has become publicly available on the
Determination Date (excluding inflation indexed securities) (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer
published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to (i) the remaining
average life of the Bonds to be redeemed, or (ii) the period from the redemption date to the Stated
Maturity of the Bonds to be redeemed, as shall be determined by the Chief Financial Officer and set forth
in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to
such Stated Maturity is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States
Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year will be used. “Determination Date” means
the date which is that number of Business Days prior to the redemption date as shall be set forth in the
relevant Bond Order or Indenture.

1685

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009

A portion of Section 3. of the Master Bond Ordinance is hereby amended, said amended portion of

however, that no Bond shall have a Stated Maturity which is later than the date which is twenty-five thirty
(2530) years after its Dated Date.
Section 3.

Addition of Available Redemption Provisions for the Bonds.

Section 5. of the Master Bond Ordinance is hereby amended and restated, said amended and restated

Fund, in the case of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds, at a price of par, without premium,
plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, and in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds at a
price of Compound Accreted Value calculated to the date fixed for redemption, on November 15 (or such
other date as may be provided in the relevant Bond Order) of the years and in the amounts and subject to
such provisions as shall be set forth in the relevant Bond Order. The County covenants that it will redeem
Term Bonds pursuant to the mandatory redemption requirement for such Term Bonds and provide
Pledged Taxes accordingly.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal
amounts of such Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier
optional redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds credited against future
mandatory redemption requirements in such order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief
Financial Officer may determine. In the absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of
such Bonds shall be credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological
order of such payments beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the
amount subject to mandatory redemption in the year preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on
or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day preceding any mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may, and if
directed by the Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not
exceeding the amount of such Bonds required to be retired on such mandatory redemption date and at a
price not exceeding par plus accrued interest. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the
principal amount thereof shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory
redemption date.
The County shall provide the Trustee with written notice of such reduction, which notice shall be
given within thirty (30) days after such redemption or purchase, and the Trustee shall promptly give
written notice of the same to the Bondholders, in the manner hereinafter provided.

limitations set forth in this Section.
C.

Bonds may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part, on any
Business Day, at the “Make-Whole Redemption Price,” which is the greater of (i) one hundred percent
(100%) of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present value of the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Stated Maturity of the Bonds to be
redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on
which the Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Bonds are to be redeemed on a

to or in excess of the adjusted Treasury Rate, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Bonds
to be redeemed on the redemption date. The Chief Financial Officer shall confirm and transmit the MakeWhole Redemption Price on such dates and to such parties as shall be necessary to effectuate such makewhole redemption.
D.
Extraordinary Optional Redemption. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or
Indenture, the Bonds may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part,
upon the occurrence of an Extraordinary Event, at the “Extraordinary Optional Redemption Price,” which

and to such parties as shall be necessary to effectuate such extraordinary optional redemption.
E.
Redemption Procedure. The Bonds subject to redemption shall be identified, notice
given, and paid and redeemed pursuant to the procedures as follows.

1687

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
1.

Redemption Notice. For a mandatory redemption of Term Bonds, unless otherwise
notified by the County, the Trustee shall proceed to redeem the Term Bonds without any
further order or direction from the County hereunder or otherwise. For an optional
redemption, the County shall, at least forty-five (45) days prior to any optional
redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such redemption date and of the principal amount and maturities of Bonds
to be redeemed.

2.

Selection of Bonds within a Maturity. Current Interest Bonds shall be redeemed only in
the principal amount of $5,000 each and integral multiples thereof, and Capital
Appreciation Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts representing $5,000 Maturity
Amount and integral multiples thereof. For purposes of any redemption of less than all of
the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed
shall be selected by lot by the Trustee for the Bonds of such maturity by such method of
lottery as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided, that such lottery shall
provide for the selection for redemption of Bonds or portions thereof so that each $5,000
principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such Bond shall be as likely to
be called for redemption as any other such $5,000 Bond or $5,000 portion. The Trustee
shall make such selection (a) upon or prior to the time of the giving of official notice of
redemption, or (b) in the event of a refunding or defeasance, upon advice from the
County that certain Bonds have been refunded or defeased and are no longer Outstanding
as defined.
Alternatively, if so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, for purposes of any
redemption of less than all of the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or
portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee pro-rata based upon the
aggregate principal amount thereof then Outstanding; provided, however, that the portion
of any Bond of a denomination of more than the minimum Authorized Denomination to
be redeemed shall be in the principal amount of an Authorized Denomination and that, in
selecting portions of such Bonds for redemption, the Trustee shall treat each such Bond
as representing that number of Bonds of said minimum Authorized Denomination which
is obtained by dividing the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed in part by said
minimum Authorized Denomination. If the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form at the
time of such redemption, the County shall direct the Trustee to instruct the Depository to
select the specific Bonds within such maturity for redemption pro-rata among such
Bonds. The County and the Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to insure
that the Depository properly selects such Bonds for redemption.

3.

Official Notice of Redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing
of the Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond
selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Unless
waived by the registered owner of Bonds to be redeemed, official notice of any such
redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the County by mailing the
redemption notice by first class U.S. mail not less than thirty (30) days and not more than
sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the
Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such
other address as is furnished in writing by such registered owner to the Trustee. All
official notices of redemption shall include the name of the Bonds and at least the
information as follows:
(a)

the redemption date;

1688

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
(b)

the redemption price;, or in the case of a make-whole or extraordinary
optional redemption, a description of the formula by which the
redemption price shall be determined;

(c)

if less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series and of a particular
maturity are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial
redemption of Bonds of a Series within such maturity, the respective
principal amounts) of the Bonds to be redeemed;

(d)

a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become
due and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for
redemption and that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from and after
said date; and

(e)

the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the
redemption price, which place of payment shall be the office designated
for that purpose of the Trustee.

4.

Conditional Redemption. Unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of the
Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of such
notice of redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that said
redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or
prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such moneys are not received, such notice shall
be of no force and effect, the County shall not redeem such Bonds, and the Trustee shall
give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such
moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.

5.

Bonds Shall Become Due. Official notice of redemption having been given as described,
the Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be redeemed shall, subject to the stated condition in
paragraph 4. immediately preceding, on the redemption date, become due and payable at
the redemption price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the County
shall default in the payment of the redemption price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance
with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. The
procedure for the payment of interest due as part of the redemption price shall be as
herein provided for payment of interest otherwise due.

6.

Insufficiency in Notice Not Affecting Other Bonds; Failure to Receive Notice; Waiver.
Neither the failure to mail such redemption notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed,
to any particular registered owner of a Bond, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice
with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been properly given, failure of a
registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to invalidate, limit
or delay the effect of the notice or redemption action described in the notice. Such notice
may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond entitled to receive such notice,
either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by registered owners shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing
shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. In lieu of the foregoing official notice, so long as the Bonds are held in book
entry form, notice may be given as provided in the Representation Letter, and the giving
of such notice shall constitute a waiver by the Depository and the book entry owner, as
registered owner, of the foregoing notice. After giving proper notification of redemption
to the Trustee, as applicable, the County shall not be liable for any failure to give or
defect in notice.

1689

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
7.

New Bond in Amount Not Redeemed. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of like
Series and tenor, of Authorized Denominations, of the same maturity, and bearing the
same rate of interest in the amount of the unpaid principal.

8.

Effect of Nonpayment upon Redemption. If any Bond or portion of Bond called for
redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, in the case of
Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption
date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption; in the case
of Variable Rate Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest as provided in a
relevant Indenture; and, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound
Accreted Value at such redemption date shall continue to accrue interest from such
redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital Appreciation Bond, or
portion thereof, so called for redemption.

9.

Bonds to Be Cancelled; Payment to Identify Bonds. All Bonds which have been
redeemed shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.
Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other
transfer of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identifying, by
issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or other
transfer.

10.

Additional Notice. The County agrees to provide such additional notice of redemption as
it may deem advisable at such time as it determines to redeem Bonds, taking into account
any requirements or guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board, the Government Accounting Standards Board, or any other
federal or state agency having jurisdiction or authority in such matters; provided,
however, that such additional notice shall be (a) advisory in nature, (b) solely in the
discretion of the County (unless a separate agreement shall be made), (c) not be a
condition precedent of a valid redemption or a part of the Bond contract, and (d) any
failure or defect in such notice shall not delay or invalidate the redemption of Bonds for
which proper official notice shall have been given. Reference is also made to the
provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking of the County with respect to the
Bonds, which may contain other provisions relating to notice of redemption of Bonds.

11.

Trustee to Advise County. As part of its duties hereunder, the Trustee shall prepare and
forward to the County a statement as to notices given with respect to each redemption
together with copies of the notices as mailed.

Section 4.

Authority to Designate Bonds as Build America Bonds.

BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 74 Taxation, Sections
74-70 and 74-71 of the Cook County Code are hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-70.

Class 8a and 8b Designation / Assessment Class

(a)
Class 8a. Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or commercial purposes, which
real estate would qualify for a class 8 designation pursuant to Sec. 74-62 thru Sec. 74-64, except for the
fact that the qualifying use of the property prior to application for the incentive does not comply with the
definition of abandoned property provided for in Sec.74-62(b), can receive a designation as a class 8a
property so long as the applicant can show that it has complied with all of the requirements necessary to
receive a class 8 designation per Sec. 74-62 thru Sec. 74-64, except for meeting the definition of
abandonment provided for in Sec. 74-62(b), but only when the Cook County Board of Commissioners
provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such designation absent abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a resolution or
ordinance in support of class 8a designation absent abandonment when:
a.

an applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from the
municipality in which the real estate is located or the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
agreement to abate a portion of the local government’s sales tax generated by the
industrial or commercial enterprise located on such real estate and such
abatement of sales tax must cover the period of time for which the applicant
would qualify for this Class 8a incentive;

b.

applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that due to national and regional economic conditions beyond its
control the industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a significant
reduction in net operating income of at least 40% in the year it makes application
for this incentive as compared to the average net operating income of the
industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three years;

1705

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009

(2)

(3)

c.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to,
an economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners that the ongoing industrial or commercial
enterprise is not economically viable and as such it will cease operations within
sixty-days of the submission of an eligibility application for class 8a designation
to the Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the property will become vacant and
unused for an extended period of time of at least twenty-four months; and

d.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to,
an economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners that designation as a class 8a property will
allow the industrial or commercial enterprise to be economically viable and
thereby continue its operations so that the industrial or commercial enterprise can
continue to occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an extended period of time.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that
industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net
operating income of at least 40% in the year it makes application for the
incentive as compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or
commercial enterprise in the prior three years;

b.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that
class 8a designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or
commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that without such
designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would not be economically
viable causing the property to become vacant and unused;

c.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the designation of the property as a class 8a property absent an
abandonment requirement; and

d.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the application made to the Cook County Assessor requesting
designation as a class 8a property absent an abandonment requirement.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a
class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this section, the municipality in which
the real estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:
a.

a finding by the municipality that it has determined that class 8a designation of
the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise to
continue its operations and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
become vacant and unused;

b.

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the action by the
Cook County Board of Commissioners to support designation of the property as a
class 8a property;

1706

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
c.

(4)

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the class 8a
application to the Cook County Assessor; and

Real estate receiving a class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value provided for in Section 74-64 (11),
however the term of the incentive will be limited to five years only and such class 8a
designation shall not be renewed.
a.

after the initial application has been approved and granted, if the subject real
estate receiving the class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this section
is sold or the applicant transfers ownership of any portion of the property at any
time prior to the five year term of the 8a classification, then the property’s 8a
classification shall be subject to an eligibility review by the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, the municipality, and the Assessor under the procedures set
forth in this Ordinance for the remainder of the 5 year term.

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8a designation an eligibility application must
be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation can not be applied to real estate unless the following has occurred:
application is made to the Cook County Assessor; all required municipal and county
ordinances and resolutions are provided to the Cook County Assessor; and the Cook
County Assessor determines that the real estate which is the subject of the application for
a class 8a designation would qualify for designation as a class 8 property but for the
inability to comply with the definition of abandonment pursuant to Sec.74-62(b).

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this section to determine
eligibility for the benefits provided under class 8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a class 8a designation, the Cook County
Assessor shall forward such application and any supporting documentation provided with
such application to the Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee for
consideration as to whether the County Board will provide a resolution or ordinance in
support of a class 8a designation absent abandonment.

(9)

Real estate receiving a class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
not be eligible for a class 8a designation for any year prior to the assessment year for
which an application for the designation is made to the Cook County Assessor.

(10)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee may adopt rules consistent
with this section that may be needed to ensure proper review of information, data and
documents submitted in support of a request to the County Board for a resolution or
ordinance in support of a class 8a designation as provided for in this section.

(11)

Applicants for a class 8a designation of property can only make such an application for
the following assessment years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and the Cook County
Assessor shall not designate any real estate as class 8a property for assessment year 2018
or thereafter.

1707

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
(12)

designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment, if the industrial or
commercial enterprise located on the property ceases operations and the subject real
estate becomes vacant and unused.

(13)

Real estate that receives a designation as a class 8a incentive property will lose such
designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment upon termination of the
required partial sales tax abatement by local government.

(14)

upon passage.

(b)
Class 8b. Real estate that is used primarily for hospital purposes where the property has
been acquired for hospital use by an acquirer unrelated to the disposer, thereby avoiding Illinois Health
Facilities Planning Board discontinuation approval, shall be considered for a class 8b designation if it
meets the requirements of this section and the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a
resolution or ordinance in support of such designation.
(1)

(2)

(3)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a resolution or
ordinance in support of class 8b designation when:
a.

the applicant is a hospital as defined in the Hospital Licensing Act that is licensed
by the state, and the abandonment of the hospital would require the applicant to
obtain a permit or exemption from the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board
pursuant to the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing its
operations and to obtain a second permit or exemption prior to re-opening or
otherwise re-establishing the hospital after abandonment; and

b.

the applicant demonstrated that approval of the class 8b designation will
materially increase the likelihood that the property will be retained for hospital
use with the associated employment benefits relative to industrial or commercial
use of the property.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the
applicant demonstrated that approval of the class 8b designation will materially
increase the likelihood that the property will be retained for hospital use; and

b.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the designation of the property as a class 8b property.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a
class 8b property is sought using the provisions of this section, the municipality in which
the real estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:

1708

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
a.

a finding by the municipality that without a classification having the impact of
this section, special circumstances inherent to hospitals including but not limited
to efforts to continue treatments, maintain access to emergency medical and other
health care services, and the unique requirement that mandates that hospital
operations are continually maintained without interruption in order for the Illinois
Health Facilities Planning Board to issue a permit and licensure approval for the
continued operation of the hospital, will not be addressed and the hospital will
become vacant and underutilized.

b.

a statement by the municipality finding a classification having the impact of this
section to be necessary for the redevelopment of the subject hospital to occur;
and

c.

a statement by the corporate authorities of municipality that they support and
consent to the filing of an application for a classification having the impact of
this section.

(4)

Real estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value and for the term provided for in
Section 74-64 (11).

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8b designation, a class 8 or class 8b
application must be made or have been made to the Cook County Assessor. Any
application for class 8 submitted with required municipal approval after July 1, 2008 for
hospital property where the property was acquired for hospital use by an unrelated
acquirer, avoiding the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board discontinuation approval,
shall be reconsidered as an application pursuant to this section upon supplement of such
class 8 application with the additional information required in this section, if any. Upon
receipt of an application, the Cook County Assessor shall forward such application and
any supporting documentation provided with the application to the Cook County Board
of Commissioners for consideration as to whether the Cook County Board will provide a
resolution or ordinance in support of a class 8b designation. Real estate receiving a class
8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be eligible for such

with Federal law and moving toward reaching the County’s goal of creating equal opportunity in the
award of or participation in County contracts the urgency of the situation and the difficulty of minority

Business & Economic Development Subcommittee to determine the County’s compliance with the
MBE/WBE Ordinance and Federal law on MBE and WBE contract participation, to get proper feed back

under existing capital funds shall be included in a general obligation bond for equipment.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 04/01/09.
Chairman Daley stated that committee members have received a revised book listing all Capital
Equipment Requests, sorted by department and sequenced by item number. Requests from the Health &
Hospitals System beginning on page 40 with item number 68 will be considered today.

1738

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Commissioner Suffredin noted that the Cook County Health & Hospitals System has a request for $65.5
million. He asked if the requests that are before the committee today are identical to the requests that
were approved earlier during the budget process.
David R. Small, Chief Operating Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System, stated that an updated
list of projects was distributed this morning. There are ten items of deletions and two items of addition;
the new total is $67,316,693. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Warren L. Batts, Chairman of the Board, Cook County Health & Hospitals System, introduced William
Foley, Chief Executive Officer for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System.
Mr. Batts stated that the initial request for Fiscal Year 2009 was previously approved at approximately
$63 million. In response to Commissioner Suffredin’s question, Mr. Batts stated all of the items now
requested by the Health & Hospitals System were previously approved at some point by the Cook County
Board.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers, in
accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):
PUBLIC SPEAKERS
1. George Blakemore, Concerned Citizen
2. Elliott El-Amin, Vice President, Sales, CE Services, LLC
Chairman Daley recessed the meeting to the hour of 10:00 A.M. on Thursday, May 7, 2009 in the
County Building, Board Room, Room 569.

MAY 7, 2009
Pursuant to notice, your Committee reconvened its recessed meeting of May 6, 2009 on Thursday, May 7,
2009 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois,
to consider Communication No. 299702, for the purpose of conducting departmental reviews of Fiscal
Years 2007, 2008 and 2009 Capital Equipments Requests.
Chairman Daley called upon the Honorable Maria Pappas, Cook County Treasurer, to address the
Committee.
Treasurer Pappas informed the Committee that she will not require new capital equipment funding for
Fiscal Year 2009. She is withdrawing previously requested capital equipment items at this time, thereby
reducing the total capital equipment request by $61,175. (The referenced document is on file in the
Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley next called upon Antonio Hylton, Chief of the Bureau of Technology, to address the
Committee.
Mr. Hylton distributed supplemental information amending the Bureau’s request for capital equipment.
(The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)

1739

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Mr. Hylton stated that on March 30, 2009, the Bureau held its first ever Technology Summit, and prior to
the May 5, 2009 Board meeting he issued a summary report of the 2009 Capital Projects that are being
discussed at today’s meeting.
Commissioner Goslin asked if Mr. Hylton’s list was prioritized by most critical to least critical.
Mr. Hylton stated that was his intention. He stated that Category 1 and 2 in the backup material lists
those items that are already contractually committed; therefore he would ask the Committee for special
consideration on those items.
Commissioner Goslin asked if there are any court orders associated with any of the items.
Mr. Hylton stated that Category 2 contains equipment for the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
(JTDC), which may be mandated by court order.
Mr. Hylton stated that acquiring a second mainframe is an option the County may consider. He is
studying the potential costs involved, and initial estimates are lower than expected.
Mr. Hylton stated that Category 1 and 2 items on the Bureau’s list are essential, while Categories 3, 4, 5
and 6 are lower priorities.
Chairman Daley reminded Mr. Hylton that prior to voting on Capital Equipment requests, the Committee
will need to be informed of any change in his priorities.
Chairman Daley informed the Committee that if the Commissioners were to approve all the items under
the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, along with the items requested by the Bureau of
Technology, all available money for capital equipment would be gone.
Chairman Daley next called upon the Honorable James M. Houlihan, Cook County Assessor, to address
the Committee.
Mr. Houlihan referred to earlier remarks by Mr. Hylton, and noted for the record that the Assessor’s
Office was the lead agency in creating the Geographic Information System (GIS) for Cook County. The
Assessor’s Office has a history of working in cooperation with the Bureau of Technology, and his office
is willing to participate in further efforts to benefit from efficiencies of scale.
Mr. Houlihan stated that his request contained nothing new for Fiscal Year 2009; all items contained in
this $1 million request were previously submitted, and are necessary to keep their system functioning as a
result of a workforce reduction of 100 individuals due to automation efforts within the County. He
provided the Committee with a priority ranking of six (6) proposed projects. (The referenced document is
on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley next called upon the Honorable Larry R. Rodgers, Jr., Commissioner of the Board of
Review, to address the Committee.
Commissioner Rodgers stated that his office needs additional IT staff, and this may be requested in next
year’s budget. Their Capital Equipment Request totals $319,000, which originally included $68,000 in
furniture and the remainder in technology. Upon further review, they have determined to allocate the
entire $319,000 to technology. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)

1740

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Chairman Daley next called on the Honorable Thomas J. Dart, Cook County Sheriff, to address the
Committee.
Sheriff Dart noted for the record that his original request for capital equipment was for $30 million, but
currently the request has been decreased to $25 million. This figure includes $10 million to purchase
needed vehicles. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley next called upon the Honorable Anita Alvarez, State’s Attorney, to address the
Committee.
Ms. Alvarez presented the Fiscal Year 2009 Capital Equipment Request for her office, and indicated the
entire request of $7.6 million was needed.
Chairman Daley next called on the Honorable David Orr, Cook County Clerk, to address the Committee.
Clerk Orr stated that he is amending his original request for $378,000. That amount has been decreased
by $108,000, resulting in a new total of $270,000. A high priority for his office is the Microsoft Upgrade
project, Item 493. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley next called upon the Honorable Dorothy Brown, Clerk of the Circuit Court, to address
the Committee.
Clerk Brown informed the Committee that she has cut her original capital equipment request of $35.1
million; it has been reduced to $16.5 million, $5 million of which can come from special purpose funds.
The net amount needed from bond proceeds is $11.5 million. (The referenced document is on file in the
Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley next called upon the Honorable Timothy C. Evans, Chief Judge, to address the
Committee.
Judge Evans informed the Committee that the Office of the Chief Judge has decreased their original
request of $3.1 million by $1.3 million, for a new total request of $1.8 million. Judge Evans stated that
this total is exclusive of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC).
Chairman Daley called upon Earl L. Dunlap, Transitional Administrator for the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center, to address the Committee.
Chairman Daley asked Mr. Dunlap to address the issue with regard to the sign-in system at the JTDC that
is inoperable.
Mr. Dunlap stated that he was aware the County purchased an employee timekeeping system several
years before he assumed his position at the JTDC, but the system was never installed. Since that time, he
has been working collaboratively with the Chief Judge’s management information staff to initiate an
automated program for the time clocks.
Mr. Dunlap stated that he anticipated that the automated time clock system will probably come on line in
the next six months.
Chairman Daley next called upon the Honorable Eugene Moore, Cook County Recorder of Deeds, to
address the Committee.

1741

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Darlena Williams-Burnett, Chief Deputy Recorder, Recorder of Deeds Office, informed the Committee
that Recorder Moore was unavailable, and that she would speak on his behalf.
Chairman Daley stated that he had been informed that there was $2.4 million available in the Document
Storage Fund. Chairman Daley asked Ms. Williams-Burnett whether that money could be used to
purchase capital equipment, thus reducing the amount of bond proceeds that would be needed for the
Recorder’s Office.
Ms. Williams-Burnett responded in the affirmative. Further, Ms. Williams-Burnett informed the
Committee that the Office of the Recorder of Deeds had been told to resubmit previous capital requests at
this time, because the amount of bonds that may be issued was still under discussion.
Chairman Daley stated that the Committee had expressed its intent to reduce the amount of bond funding
by any means possible, including the use of special purpose funds for purchase of capital equipment
where appropriate.
Ms. Williams-Burnett stated that the Recorder of Deeds would comply with this directive.
Chairman Daley recessed the meeting to the hour of 10:00 A.M. on Friday, May 8, 2009 in the
County Building, Board Room, Room 569.

MAY 8, 2009
Pursuant to notice, your Committee reconvened its recessed meeting of May 6, 2009 and May 7, 2009, on
Friday, May 8, 2009 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, 118 North Clark Street,
Chicago, Illinois, to consider Communication No. 299702, for the purpose of conducting departmental
reviews of Fiscal Years 2007, 2008 and 2009 Capital Equipments Requests.
Chairman Daley called upon Joseph M. Fratto, Chief of Staff, Office of the President, and Interim Chief
Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance, to address the Committee. Mr. Fratto stated that the only request
for additional funding in any of the offices under the President comes from the Department of Human
Rights, Ethics and Womens’ Issues.
Chairman Daley called upon Marynic Foster, Director, Department of Human Rights, Ethics and
Womens’ Issues, to address the Committee.
Ms. Foster addressed the Committee regarding her request for $2,476.
Chairman Daley next called upon Mark Kilgallon, Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of
Administration, to address the Committee. Mr. Kilgallon noted that Item 25 is a request for $750,000 for
a sprinkler system which does not belong in Capital Equipment, but rather belongs under Capital
Improvements. This item will be withdrawn from the Capital Equipment Request.
Kimberly Leonard, Business Manager, Office of the Medical Examiner, provided an explanation of the
reductions in the Medical Examiner’s request, as follows: Item 14 is removed. Four of the lines under
Item 16 are removed: the $1,000 (bench top pH meter), $2,500 (sonicator), $850 (water bath), and $1,000
(shakers). Under Item 17, the following will be removed: the Tiffin 62 and 65 mm, and the Promaster
chargers and batteries. Under Item 20, the microscope tables are removed for a $26,000 reduction.
Under Item 22, the following will be removed: $43,500 for a vacuum tissue processor. Item 23 is being
removed from the request in its entirety, which is $12,600. Item 24 is also being removed in its entirety,

1742

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
$11,000. Under Item 26, both the $78,000 and the $2,000 requests are being removed. Under Item 27,
desk chairs are being reduced from $9,308 to $3,580, and the following amounts are being removed from
that item: $5,835, $1,890, and $1,200. The net reduction, including the relocation of the sprinkler
system, is $1,114,222, resulting in a new total request of $939,961.
Chairman Daley next called upon Rupert F. Graham, Superintendent of the Highway Department, to
address the Committee. In response to a question from Commissioner Gainer about the size of the snow
removal fleet, Superintendent Graham indicated a written response would be provided. (The referenced
document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Herbert T. Schumann, Jr., Chief Financial Officer of the Highway Department, responded to a question
from Commissioner Gainer about the merits of leasing verses buying. He indicated the Department
believes leasing is not a less expensive option in the long run.
Chairman Daley called on the Honorable Abishi C. Cunningham, Jr., Cook County Public Defender, to
address the Commissioners.
Mr. Cunningham began with page 17: Items 31 and 32 were removed from the request. Item 34,
vehicles, was modified from $16,000 to $8,000. Item 41, projectors, was modified from $14,000 to
$10,000. Item 42, scanners, was modified from $13,000 to $10,000. Item 46 was removed. The new
total is $1,712,000.
Chairman Daley next called upon Dr. Donna Alexander, Director of the Department of Animal Control,
to address the Committee. Dr. Alexander stated that her department had the ability to pay for its capital
equipment needs with resources available in the Animal Control Fund, and therefore its $80,000 request
is being withdrawn from consideration as part of the bond issuance.
Chairman Daley next called upon Bruce Washington, Director of the Bureau of Capital, Planning and
Facilities Management, to address the Committee.
Chairman Daley informed the Committee that a handout from Mr. Washington is being distributed with
his priority projects identified, while other projects are deleted. Chairman Daley stated that the new
amount requested by the Bureau is $7.7 million. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the
County Clerk.)
Mr. Washington stated that initially the Bureau submitted a total request of $16.2 million. After
reviewing the request and re-prioritizing, an amended request was prepared at a reduction of $8.5 million.
Chairman Daley next called upon Joseph Sova, Chief, Bureau of Human Resources to address the
Committee.
Chairman Daley stated that Mr. Sova would address Item 392, which was included in the Fiscal Year
2009 request, and was previously approved at $2 million.
Commissioner Gainer asked Mr. Sova if he could purchase the requested equipment for a lower amount.
Mr. Sova informed Commissioner Gainer that he would negotiate with the vendor in order to obtain the
lowest price possible.
Chairman Daley next called upon Laura A. Burman, County Auditor, to address the Committee.

1743

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Ms. Burman informed the Committee that her request for capital is for seven (7) laptop computers; the
current equipment is six years old and is used by field auditors on a daily basis; the equipment fails often
and impacts their productivity.
Chairman Daley called upon Patrick M. Blanchard, the Independent Inspector General, to address the
Committee.
Mr. Blanchard stated that there are four (4) separate categories that the Independent Inspector General’s
Office is asking for: 1) vehicles; 2) computer equipment; 3) furniture; and 4) security equipment.
Mr. Blanchard stated that in regards to the furniture request, there are new employees being hired and
they do not have adequate furnishings at this time.
Chairman Daley inquired of Bruce Washington whether they had checked in the warehouse to see if any
furniture was available.
Mr. Washington stated that he has been working with Mr. Blanchard and has identified the space which is
being renovated at this time, but there is not enough furniture to outfit the entire request.
Chairman Daley next called upon Matthew B. DeLeon, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners, to
address the Committee.
Chairman Daley referred to a request in the amount of $250,000 to update the Commissioner’s Offices for
wireless technology. He believes it would be inappropriate to approve a request of this nature, at a time
when many other similar requests for equipment upgrades are being rejected by the Board.
Mr. DeLeon stated that the original budget for this project was $500,000, but after examining the
priorities it was reduced by half. The remaining elements of the project relate to network connectivity in
the offices of the commissioners, and this work is necessary.
Mr. DeLeon stated that Mr. Hylton indicated that the $250,000 would provide for a new system, while a
lesser amount of $75,000 would repair the existing equipment and it would carry the office through a
shorter term.
Chairman Daley expressed his preference for the lower amount of $75,000, only if the work truly was
necessary.
Chairman Daley next called upon Nicholas G. Grapsas, Public Administrator, to address the Committee.
Mr. Grapsas explained his request for $15,900 in new computer equipment.
Chairman Daley next called upon Jack Weinrauch, Director of the Department of Administrative
Hearings, to address the Committee.
Mr. Weinrauch explained the need to increase his request from $12,500 to $37,500. (The referenced
document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley recessed the meeting to the Call of the Chair.

1744

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
MAY 18, 2009
Pursuant to notice, your Committee reconvened its recessed meeting of May 6, 2009, May 7, 2009 and
May 8, 2009 on Monday, May 18, 2009 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois, to consider Communication No. 299702, for the purpose of
conducting departmental reviews of Fiscal Years 2007, 2008 and 2009 Capital Equipments Requests.
Chairman Daley stated that the Budget Director has distributed to all members a revised book detailing
the current requests for capital equipment. It was revised based upon statements made by the Elected
Officials, Department Heads and Bureau Chiefs during their presentations before the Finance Committee.
Further, Chairman Daley stated that the Committee has received a memo from Commissioner Suffredin.
In the memo, Commissioner Suffredin suggested that in order to give full management discretion to each
department, the Commissioners should approve lump-sum appropriations for Capital Equipment.
Additionally, his memo proposed amended total amounts for each department, for a revised total request
amount of $106,034,599.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that there is a timeline issue which he has discussed with the Budget
Director; the timeline issue is that the Commissioners are still going to have to amend the underlying
Bond Ordinance to add whatever dollar amount of bonding this would add up to. Amending the
previously adopted Bond Ordinance is not currently before Board of Commissioners, and the earliest date
that it could be considered is June 2, 2009. In conclusion, Commissioner Suffredin stated that his
proposed action would be to grant all capital equipment requests under $2.5 million. For amounts over
$2.5 million, the Committee would approve a proportional flat amount that would apply to each
department, thus allowing for department heads, bureau chiefs, and elected officials to make their priority
choices within that limitation.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that based upon information he received from the Budget Director, there
is an extra $20 million that could be added to the total request.
Takashi Reinbold, Director of the Department of Budget and Management Services, stated that the $20
million figure Commissioner Suffredin has identified comes from the difference between what was
originally allocated for capital spending, and what was adopted. Originally $262 million was approved,
yet the Board has adopted a $242 million balance.
Chairman Daley asked if a County-wide emergency were to arise that required an unanticipated capital
expense, from where would that money be taken?
Mr. Reinbold stated that $242 million was approved which was a combination of $127.5 million for
Fiscal Year 2009 and $115.3 million for Fiscal Year 2010. There is nothing set aside for unexpected
emergencies.
Chairman Daley stated that the Budget Office should prepare a report regarding how much Cook County
can expect to receive from the federal stimulus package.
Commissioner Collins suggested that a grant department be established, which would focus only on grant
writing.

1745

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Mr. Reinbold informed Commissioner Collins that in the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget, there was a business
unit created in his department in which there is a person who is responsible for grant writing. Also, an
individual in the Comptroller’s Office is responsible for coordinating the effort to maximize the flow of
stimulus money to Cook County.
Commissioner Collins inquired whether that individual was present. Ben Oluwole Johnson, Deputy
Comptroller for Cook County, identified himself and addressed the Committee regarding his duties.
Chairman Daley asked Mr. Johnson if he would be able to meet with each commissioner to brief them on
his work to capture federal stimulus money. Mr. Johnson indicated he would do so.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the proposal from Commissioner Suffredin includes additional
projects in the Sheriff’s Office that were previously approved.
Commissioner Suffredin responded that those projects were not included because approval was already
granted.
Mr. Reinbold informed the Commissioners that they have previously approved $8.4 million in projects
for the Sheriff, and that $4 million of that has already been encumbered and has purchase order numbers
assigned.
Alexis Herrera, Chief Financial Officer for the Sheriff’s Office, concurred that $8.4 million in projects
were previously approved. Last week Mr. Reinbold informed her that $4.2 million was already in
purchase orders and it did not have to be included in the total request before the Finance Committee at
this time. The balance of $4.2 million is part of the jail management information system, but they do not
have purchase orders prepared as of yet.
Commissioner Silvestri asked about the source of the remaining $4.2 million.
Commissioner Suffredin explained that the last time a bond amendment was adopted, the Commissioners
raised it to $252 million, and that new total included $8.4 million for the projects requested by the Sheriff.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that the remaining balance of $4.2 million in the Sheriff’s request was
addressed by increasing the Sheriff’s amount and reducing the request for the Health & Hospitals System
by a corresponding amount. This adjustment was discussed with the Health & Hospitals System, and
they have agreed to accept it.
Chairman Daley asked for leave to have the Health & Hospitals System state for the record that they
accept the reduction.
William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, stated that
they agree with Commissioner Suffredin and accept the modification.
Chairman Daley stated that Commissioners Collins, Gorman, Goslin, Maldonado, Schneider,
Silvestri and Steele have asked to be added as sponsors.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved to accept the Substitute
Resolution for Communication No. 299702. The motion carried. Commissioner Butler voted no.

1746

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved that the Substitute Resolution
(Communication No. 299702) be approved and adopted, as amended. Commissioner Silvestri

WHEREAS, County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article

their property tax levy on an annual basis, Cook County has not increased its property tax
levy since 1996 and the levy has remained constant at $720 million; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to streamline County government and prevent further economic
hardship on County residents, the Cook County Board of Commissioners implemented
budgetary cuts in the 2007 fiscal year with an on average seventeen percent (17%)
countywide budgetary reduction; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has a structural deficit and due to County Board approved
appropriations and contractual obligations, the Board of Cook County Commissioners
acknowledged the need for additional revenue and increased County revenue in a manner that
would afford adequate funding to maintain essential services; and
WHEREAS, as a home rule county, County of Cook is authorized by 55 ILCS 5/5-1006 to
impose a tax upon all persons in Cook County engaged in the business of selling tangible

quarter percent (.25%); and
WHEREAS, in addition, on April 7, 2009, a number of Townships had a question regarding
Cook County’s increased sales tax, those Townships voiced their concern and though such
referenda is advisory in nature and not binding, it is good public policy to provide that the
opinions of the voters be acknowledged and heard; and

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Contract Compliance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Tuesday, May 19, 2009 at the hour of 2:00 P.M. for a public hearing in the Board Room,
Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendation is as follows:
300319

RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A PUBLIC HEARING REGARDING THE IMPACT OF
UTILIZATION OF GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS ON M/WBEs
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto
Maldonado, County Commissioner; Co-sponsored by Peter N. Silvestri and Joseph Mario
Moreno, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, on April 9, 2009 the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board (“System
Board”) adopted the Procurement Policy for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System
(“System”); and
WHEREAS, the System Board took this action pursuant to the Ordinance Establishing the
Cook County Health & Hospitals System (“Enabling Ordinance”) which expressly provides
that the System Board shall have the authority over all procurement and contracts for the
System, and further provides that the System may exercise this authority, in whole or in part,
pursuant to its discretion; and

1801

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
WHEREAS, as the System’s Interim Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), David R. Small,
stated in a letter to the Board of Commissioners dated April 20, 2009, the System Board has
stated that it is genuinely committed to the County’s policy to promote equal opportunity in
its procurement process and has expressly set forth in the System’s new Procurement Policy
that Protected Class Enterprises shall participate in not less than 35 percent of the annual
aggregate value of all contracts awarded by the System; and
WHEREAS, in furtherance of its mission to ensure sound fiscal management of all aspects
of the System, the System has issued a Request for Proposal (“RFP”) for the System’s
participation in a Group Purchasing Organization (“GPO”), a purchasing consortia that the
Systems argues is in the best interest of the System and its patients; and
WHEREAS, numerous local small business owners who are certified as Minority and
Women Owned Business Enterprises (“M/WBEs”) oppose the System’s use of a GPO stating
that it would eliminate their ability to do business with the County because GPOs shut out
small M/WBE businesses and offer opportunities only to majority corporations who pay to
participate in GPO contracts; and
WHEREAS, as an example of this exclusion, the M/WBE business owners allege that a
vendor currently supplying pharmaceuticals to the System through a contract previously
approved by the County Board has not met its M/WBE participation goals as agreed to in its
contract; and
WHEREAS, the System disputes this allegation, stating that the County Board approved a
reduced M/WBE participation goal of 3 percent due to the stringent manufacture and delivery
standards for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and the vendor is satisfying this participation;
and
WHEREAS, the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance states a different finding in a
Memorandum to the Chair of Contract Compliance, dated April 20, 2009, concluding that the
pharmaceutical vendor’s 3% goal has not been met.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, in an effort to protect the integrity of the
M/WBE Ordinance and the impact utilization of GPOs will have on M/WBEs, the Contract
Compliance Committee of the Cook County Board will convene a public hearing and will
request to hear testimony from the following: Warren Batts, Chairman, System Board; David
R. Small, Interim System CEO; Leslie Duffy, System Chief Procurement Officer; Betty
Hancock Perry, Director of the Office of Contract Compliance; and representatives from the
M/WBE small business community, as well as from other members of the public.
*Referred to the Contract Compliance Committee on May 5, 2009.
Chairman Maldonado delivered the following opening remarks:
Today we will hear testimony from the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board, the System
Administration, and representatives from the Minority and Women Business Enterprise (M/WBE)
business community on the costs and benefits of utilizing Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) in the
procurement of hospital supplies.

1802

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Of particular concern is the impact GPOs will have on the participation level of M/WBEs. Numerous
local, small business owners who are certified as M/WBEs contend that GPOs would effectively
eliminate their ability to do business with the County because GPOs shut out small M/WBE businesses
and offer opportunities only to majority corporations who pay to participate in GPO contracts. They also
argue that GPOs are not cost effective through the life of the contract and do not provide the most current
and state-of-the-art products.
Following the System Board’s adoption of its own Procurement Policy, the System’s Chief Operating
Officer, David R. Small, stated in a letter that you will find in your back-up material, that the System
Board is genuinely committed to the County’s policy to promote equal opportunity in its procurement
process, and he stated that in the System’s new Procurement Policy that Protected Class Enterprises shall
participate in not less than 35% of the annual aggregate value of all contracts awarded by the System. He
went on to conclude that the current pharmaceutical GPO has met its reduced M/WBE participation goal.
However, the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance states a different finding in a Memorandum
to this Chair, which you will also find in your back-up material, concluding that the pharmaceutical
vendor’s reduced 3% goal has not been met.
I hope today’s hearing will resolve these divergent findings and will provide some guidance on the cost
saving potential and M/WBE participation of future GPO contracts. We will hear testimony from Warren
L. Batts, Chairman of the System Board, David R. Small, the System’s Chief Operating Officer, Leslie
Duffy, System Chief Procurement Officer, and Betty Hancock-Perry, Director of the Office of Contract
Compliance. Finally, we will hear testimony from the M/WBE business community and any other
members of the public who wish to testify. I want to thank you all for taking the time out of your busy
schedules to participate in this hearing and for recognizing the seriousness of its impact on Cook
County’s minority and women business owners.
Chairman Maldonado asked Warren L. Batts, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Cook County
Health & Hospitals System, to deliver remarks.
Chairman Batts stated the following: The Health & Hospitals System Board has reviewed the option of
using general purchasing organizations (GPOs) in depth, in response to the instructions of the Enabling
Ordinance passed by the County Board. 90% of U.S. hospitals purchase general supplies through GPOs,
and most of these organizations do so successfully and, further, most have minority-participation and
women-participation goals. Chairman Batts’ own prior experience at a Chicago hospital was that GPOs
were used successfully. He made clear that minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses
will be given as much opportunity to bid on contracts in the future as they have today. By leveraging the
large purchase power that the Health & Hospitals System possesses through centralized purchasing, a
cost-savings of $20 million should be realized this year, $20 million should be realized next year, and
more should be realized in years to come.
William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System, delivered the
following remarks: according to his experience over the years, not only is group purchasing a best
practice, it is an essential practice in controlling the supply costs of healthcare institutions. The Health &
Hospitals System’s procurement policy, which is consistent with the County Board’s procurement policy,
contains a commitment that 35% of the total aggregate contract value awarded annually be awarded to
MBE/WBE vendors. Amerisource Bergen Drug Company has complied with the terms of its contract
and has fulfilled its MBE requirements, having awarded over 1% ($2.7 million) of its $213 million spent
to the MBE vendor, Continental Ltd.

1803

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Chairman Maldonado requested that David R. Small, Chief Operating Officer, Cook County Health &
Hospitals System, provide to him a report analyzing the cost savings by the Health & Hospitals System in
pharmaceuticals.
Commissioner Sims voiced her disapproval of the use of waivers.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri’s request for clarification as to how GPOs work and how non-GPO
vendors would be utilized, Mr. Small stated the following: The GPO screens its member vendors for
reliability, availability and best pricing. If a vendor outside of the GPO were to prove better on these
merits, the Health & Hospitals System would award the contract to the vendor outside the GPO. In many
instances, however, the research would not be performed to locate such a vendor outside the GPO, if the
GPO were to provide numerous vendor options itself. When choosing a GPO, consideration is given to
whether a GPO has member vendors from Cook County.
Leslie Duffy, Procurement Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System, stated that every product
procured by the Health & Hospitals System is in some way related to a Cook County business, and this
practice will continue to a degree; additionally, there will always be room for WBE/MBE vendors.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri’s inquiry, Martin J. Grant, RPH, MBA, MIS, Director of
Pharmacy, Cook County Bureau of Health Services, stated that in 2005, the average cost to the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System for a prescription was $25, and in 2008 the cost was a little over $17
per prescription.
Commissioner Sims voiced concern that individual vendors which are not part of a GPO will not be
considered, and that Amerisource Bergen Drug Company procured a waiver which freed them of the
stricture of having to work with MWE/MBE vendors.
In response to Commissioner Sims’ concerns, Betty Hancock-Perry, Director, Office of Contract
Compliance, stated the following: Amerisource Bergen Drug Company did obtain a waiver. They also
utilized a two-tier subcontracting arrangement, where an MBE/MWE subcontractor reported to another
subcontractor which reported to Amerisource Bergen Drug Company. While this is not expressly
forbidden in the Cook County Health & Hospitals System’s Contract Compliance Ordinance, it is not the
practice of the Cook County Contract Compliance Office. Additionally, it is unclear whether
Amerisource Bergen Drug Company subcontracted 1% or 3% to this MBE/MWE subcontractor. They
did not, however, meet the MBE/MWE contract participation on this contract.
Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy Bureau Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, Office of the State’s Attorney, provided the
following clarification regarding the County’s role in the Health & Hospitals System’s procurement
process: The County, under the current Enabling Ordinance, has delegated regulation power to the Health
& Hospitals System. However, the Board can convene Contract Compliance meetings because the
County retains oversight responsibility regarding MBE/MWE compliance.
Ms. Reidy and Ms. Hancock-Perry verified that the Health & Hospitals System is required to award 35%
of the annual aggregate value of all its contracts to MBE/MWE vendors.
Chairman Maldonado asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers, in
accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):

ADULT PROBATION DEPARTMENT
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with G4S Justice Services,
Incorporated, Atlanta, Georgia, for the lease of Global Positioning System (GPS) offender tracking
equipment and support services.
Reason:

GPS equipment and services are requested in response to Public Act 95-773, also known as
the Cindy Bischoff Law, which provides for the monitoring of certain domestic violence
offenders through the use of GPS technologies. The law allows the court to order pretrial
defendants and probationers charged with a violation of an order of protection to be monitored
via GPS as a condition of bail, probation or conditional discharge. Based upon the current
volume of protection order violations, it is estimated that the daily population of offenders
eligible for GPS monitoring could reach 1000. This vendor was selected as a result of a
Request for Proposal (RFP) process.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,473,624.00 - (FY 2009: $1,425,000.00; and FY 2010: $2,048,624.00).
Contract period: July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. (280-690 Account). Requisition No. 92804018.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2009 and 2010 funds.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be
authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

before they can be considered for such employment. The expiration dated of the current
purchase order is January 31, 2010.

Redemption Procedure. The Bonds subject to redemption shall be identified, notice
given, and paid and redeemed pursuant to the procedures as follows.
1.

Redemption Notice. For a mandatory redemption of Term Bonds, unless otherwise
notified by the County, the Trustee shall proceed to redeem the Term Bonds without any
further order or direction from the County hereunder or otherwise. For an optional
redemption, the County shall, at least forty-five (45) days prior to any optional
redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such redemption date and of the principal amount and maturities of Bonds
to be redeemed.

2.

Selection of Bonds within a Maturity. Current Interest Bonds shall be redeemed only in
the principal amount of $5,000 each and integral multiples thereof, and Capital
Appreciation Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts representing $5,000 Maturity
Amount and integral multiples thereof. For purposes of any redemption of less than all of
the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed
shall be selected by lot by the Trustee for the Bonds of such maturity by such method of
lottery as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided, that such lottery shall
provide for the selection for redemption of Bonds or portions thereof so that each $5,000
principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such Bond shall be as likely to
be called for redemption as any other such $5,000 Bond or $5,000 portion. The Trustee
shall make such selection (a) upon or prior to the time of the giving of official notice of
redemption, or (b) in the event of a refunding or defeasance, upon advice from the
County that certain Bonds have been refunded or defeased and are no longer Outstanding
as defined.

1823

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
Alternatively, if so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, for purposes of any
redemption of less than all of the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or
portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee pro-rata based upon the
aggregate principal amount thereof then Outstanding; provided, however, that the portion
of any Bond of a denomination of more than the minimum Authorized Denomination to
be redeemed shall be in the principal amount of an Authorized Denomination and that, in
selecting portions of such Bonds for redemption, the Trustee shall treat each such Bond
as representing that number of Bonds of said minimum Authorized Denomination which
is obtained by dividing the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed in part by said
minimum Authorized Denomination. If the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form at the
time of such redemption, the County shall direct the Trustee to instruct the Depository to
select the specific Bonds within such maturity for redemption pro-rata among such
Bonds. The County and the Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to insure
that the Depository properly selects such Bonds for redemption.
3.

Official Notice of Redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing
of the Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond
selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Unless
waived by the registered owner of Bonds to be redeemed, official notice of any such
redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the County by mailing the
redemption notice by first class U.S. mail not less than thirty (30) days and not more than
sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the
Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such
other address as is furnished in writing by such registered owner to the Trustee. All
official notices of redemption shall include the name of the Bonds and at least the
information as follows:
(a)

the redemption date;

(b)

the redemption price;, or in the case of a make-whole or extraordinary
optional redemption, a description of the formula by which the
redemption price shall be determined;

(c)

if less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series and of a particular
maturity are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial
redemption of Bonds of a Series within such maturity, the respective
principal amounts) of the Bonds to be redeemed;

(d)

a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become
due and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for
redemption and that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from and after
said date; and

(e)

the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the
redemption price, which place of payment shall be the office designated
for that purpose of the Trustee.

1824

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
4.

Conditional Redemption. Unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of the
Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of such
notice of redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that said
redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or
prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such moneys are not received, such notice shall
be of no force and effect, the County shall not redeem such Bonds, and the Trustee shall
give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such
moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.

5.

Bonds Shall Become Due. Official notice of redemption having been given as described,
the Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be redeemed shall, subject to the stated condition in
paragraph 4. immediately preceding, on the redemption date, become due and payable at
the redemption price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the County
shall default in the payment of the redemption price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance
with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. The
procedure for the payment of interest due as part of the redemption price shall be as
herein provided for payment of interest otherwise due.

6.

Insufficiency in Notice Not Affecting Other Bonds; Failure to Receive Notice; Waiver.
Neither the failure to mail such redemption notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed,
to any particular registered owner of a Bond, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice
with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been properly given, failure of a
registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to invalidate, limit
or delay the effect of the notice or redemption action described in the notice. Such notice
may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond entitled to receive such notice,
either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by registered owners shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing
shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. In lieu of the foregoing official notice, so long as the Bonds are held in book
entry form, notice may be given as provided in the Representation Letter, and the giving
of such notice shall constitute a waiver by the Depository and the book entry owner, as
registered owner, of the foregoing notice. After giving proper notification of redemption
to the Trustee, as applicable, the County shall not be liable for any failure to give or
defect in notice.

7.

New Bond in Amount Not Redeemed. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of like
Series and tenor, of Authorized Denominations, of the same maturity, and bearing the
same rate of interest in the amount of the unpaid principal.

8.

Effect of Nonpayment upon Redemption. If any Bond or portion of Bond called for
redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, in the case of
Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption
date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption; in the case
of Variable Rate Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest as provided in a
relevant Indenture; and, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound
Accreted Value at such redemption date shall continue to accrue interest from such
redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital Appreciation Bond, or
portion thereof, so called for redemption.

1825

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2, 2009
9.

Bonds to Be Cancelled; Payment to Identify Bonds. All Bonds which have been
redeemed shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.
Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other
transfer of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identifying, by
issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or other
transfer.

10.

Additional Notice. The County agrees to provide such additional notice of redemption as
it may deem advisable at such time as it determines to redeem Bonds, taking into account
any requirements or guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board, the Government Accounting Standards Board, or any other
federal or state agency having jurisdiction or authority in such matters; provided,
however, that such additional notice shall be (a) advisory in nature, (b) solely in the
discretion of the County (unless a separate agreement shall be made), (c) not be a
condition precedent of a valid redemption or a part of the Bond contract, and (d) any
failure or defect in such notice shall not delay or invalidate the redemption of Bonds for
which proper official notice shall have been given. Reference is also made to the
provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking of the County with respect to the
Bonds, which may contain other provisions relating to notice of redemption of Bonds.

11.

Trustee to Advise County. As part of its duties hereunder, the Trustee shall prepare and
forward to the County a statement as to notices given with respect to each redemption
together with copies of the notices as mailed.

Section 4.
