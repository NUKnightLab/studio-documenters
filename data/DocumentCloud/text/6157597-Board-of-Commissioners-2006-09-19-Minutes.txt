COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ORDINANCE

The County of Cook, Illinois is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VIl, Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and pursuant to the authority therein granted, may exercise any power
and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs.
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS:
ARTICLE I

Section 1. Short Title: This article shall be known as the Cook County Assistant Public Defender
Collective Bargaining Ordinance.
Section 2. Purpose: To preserve and continue in effect the collective bargaining rights of
Assistant Public Defenders and to ensure that Assistant Public Defenders have the same rights as other
Cook County employees who are subject to collective bargaining.

4

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 19, 2006

Section 3. Right to Collecti ve Bargaining: Cook County through a resolution adopted on May
24 , 1984 determined that Assistant Public Defenders are entitled to the right to collective bargaining.
Cook County Assistant Public Defenders have collectively barga ined agreements on a regular basis since
1985, and those agreements have been approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners. The most
recent agreement was reached in June of 2006, and the economic terms were approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on July 12, 2006. Cook County shall preserve and continue in effect the
right of Cook County Assistant Public Defenders to engage in collective bargaining. Assistant Public
Defenders shall continue to have the same collective bargaining rights as are enjoyed by other Cook
County employees who are subject to collective bargaining. Assistant Public Defenders shall continue to
have the right to bargain collectively through their representative on questions of wages, hours and other
conditions of employment and the right to engage in other concerted activities for the purposes of
co ll ective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, free from interference, restraint or coercion.
Section 4 : Management Rights: The County shall not be required to bargain with the
representative of Assistant Public Defenders over matters of inherent managerial policy, which shall
include such areas of discretion or policy as the functions of the County, standards of services, its overall
budget, the organizational structure and selection of new employees, examination techniques and
direction of employees. The County, however, shall be required to bargain collectively with regard to
policy matters directly affecting wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment as well as the
impact thereon upon request by the representative of the Assistant Public Defenders.
Section 5: Collective Bargaining Defined:
For the purposes of this Article, "to bargain
collecti vely" means the performance of the mutual obligation of the County or its designated
representative and the representative of the Assistant Public Defenders to meet at reasonable times,
inc luding meetings in advance of the budget making process, and to negotiate in good fa ith with respect
to wages, hours, and other conditions of employment, not excluded by Section 4 of this Article, or the
negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder and the execution of a written contract
incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either the County or the representative of the
Assistant Public Defenders, but such obligation does not compel either the County or the representative of
the Assistant Public Defenders to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession. "To bargain
collectively" shall also include negotiations as to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.
Collective bargaining agreements between Cook County and the organization representing
Assistant Public Defenders may include a provision requiring Assistant Public Defenders covered by the
agreement who are not members of the organization to pay their proportionate share of the costs of the
collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and
conditions of employment, not to exceed the amount of dues uniformly required of members. The
organization shall certify to the County the amount constituting each nonmember Assistant Public
Defender's proportionate share w hich shall not exceed dues uniformly required of members. In such
case, the proportionate share payment shall be deducted by the County from the earnings of the
nonmember Assistant Public Defender and paid to the organization representing the Assistant Public
Defenders.
Section 6: Grievance Procedure: The collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the
County and the representative of Assistant Public Defenders shall contain a grievance resolution
procedure which shall provide for final and binding arbitration of disputes concerning the administration
or interpretation of the agreement unless mutually agreed otherwise. Any agreement conta ining a final
and binding arbitration provision shall also contain a provision prohibiting strikes for the duration of the
agreement. The grievance and arbitration provisions of any collective bargaining agreement shall be
subject to the Illinois "Uniform Arbitration Act" . The costs of such arbitration shall be borne equally by
the County and the representative of the Assistant Public Defenders.

5

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 19, 2006

or coerce Assistant Public Defenders in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in this Article; (2)
discriminate in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of emp loyment in order to
discourage membership in or other support for the representative of the Assistant Public Defenders; (3)
refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the representative of the Assistant Public Defenders
including, but not limited to, the discussing of grievances with such representative; or (4) refuse to
reduce a collective bargaining agreement to writing or refuse to sign such agreement.

matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.

of Chicago, Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. is the only qualified vendor.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $482,669.20. Contract period: January l , 2007 through December 31, 2007.
(040-240 Account). Requisition No. 70400005.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 funds.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 19, 2006

WHEREAS, in 1906, a small, four page newspaper called the Englewood Economist was published on
Chicago's South Side, keeping res idents of the rapidly growing region informed with news and opinions
on a weekly basis; and
WHEREAS, centered on the neighborhoods surrounding Halsted Street, from Garfield Boulevard to 79th
Street, the fledgling paper promised readers that each issue would give "space to the important local
items, short articles on interesting incidents of the day, occasionally a short story, and always some bits of
wit and humor"; and
WHEREAS, by 1917, circulation was nearly 20,000, due to the newpaper's growing reputation for
quality feature writing, and also creative marketing tactics, such as placing a serial number on each issue,
and then drawing a winner to be paid the sum of one dollar by a local Englewood merchant; and
WHEREAS, during the rapid social change of the 1920s, the Englewood Economist shifted its focus to
hard news, covering political matters, business, Jaw, and crime; and

Auburn Park Booster, the West Englewood Telegram, and the Englewood Economist, and thus in 1924,
the Southtown Economist was born; and
WHEREAS, over the years, the paper expanded the geography of its circulation and coverage area to
encompass the near South and Southwest suburbs, eventually moving from its longtime home on Halsted
Street to a former milk plant at 59th and Harlem; and
WHEREAS, in 1978, with the demise of Chicago's beloved afternoon paper, the Daily News, the
Southtown Economist quickly moved to fill the void by publishing daily for the first time it its history;
and
WHEREAS, in recognition of its coverage area's growing importance as an economic engine, the paper
underwent another name change in 1993, this time to the Daily Southtown, launched with the memorable
advertising catchphrase, " people up North just don ' t get it"; and
WHEREAS, the Daily Southtown and its outstanding writing staff have won numerous awards for
excellence, including the Hechinger Prize for Education Reporting, Newspaper of the Year by Suburban
Newspapers of America, the Polk Award, and the Watchdog Award for Public Interest Reporting; and
WHEREAS, after 100 years of service to the community, the Daily South town has established itself as
the paper of record for the South town region.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that the
Board does hereby offer its congratulations to the publishers, editorial staff, advertising staff, and writers
