amended as follows:
Sec. 34-286.

Title.

This subdivision shall be known as the "Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprise
Construction Interim Ordinance" and may be cited as such.
Sec. 34-287.

Recitals.

The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook find that all of the recitals
contained in the preambles to Ordinance No. 06-O-48 are full, true and correct and do incorporate them
into this subdivision by this reference.
Sec. 34-288.

Findings of discrimination.

The President and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, after considering (i)
evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, 298 F. Supp. 2d
725 (N.D. Ill. 2003) and Northern Contracting, Inc. v. Illinois Department of Transportation, 2005 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 19868 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8, 2005);(ii) County statistical evidence of continuing discrimination
against Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women in the County's contracting awards; (iii) the Report titled,
"Review of Compelling Evidence of Discrimination Against Minority- and Women-Owned Business
Enterprise in the Chicago Area Construction Industry and Recommendations for Narrowly Tailored
Remedies for Cook County, Illinois;" “The Status of Minority- and Women Owned Business Enterprises
Relevant to Construction Activity In and Around Cook County, Illinois,” submitted by Colette Holt &
Associates, and NERA Economic Consulting, and dated June 22, 2010 (the “NERA Study”): as well as
(iv) anecdotal evidence of discrimination against minorities and women in the County's construction
marketplace; and (v) receiving and considering written reports, adopts the following findings as a strong
basis in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored, remedial affirmative action program in County

The County of Cook seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime
contractors and subcontractors to participate in County construction contracting opportunities;
(b)
Since After the County's affirmative action program as it relates to construction projects
was declared unconstitutional in 2000, the County has witnessed a drastic reduction in M/WBE

evidence of discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned a and reviewed the NERA

indicating evidence of discrimination in County construction contracts and has considered the evidence in
relevant case law;

8

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011

(d)
In the absence of M/WBE participation goals the County has witnessed a drastic decline
in M/WBE participation in its construction contract below the availability of such firms and thus would
be a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace without the use of such M/WBE goals;
(e)
The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination; and The NERA Study
made recommendations for a revised Minority and Women owned business program for construction
contracting, emphasizing the establishment of Project-specific goals, implementation of race and gender
neutral measures, and enhancements to data gathering, implementation and performance monitoring of
the program;
(f)
The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination and desires to reaffirm
its commitment to full and fair opportunities for all firms to participate in its construction contracts.
Sec. 34-289.

Public purpose.

It is hereby found, determined and declared that the purpose of this Interim Ordinance is to take
steps to ensure the full and equitable participation of Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises
in the County's procurement process as both prime and subcontractors in the County's construction
contracts. The County is committed to a policy of preventing discrimination in the award of or
participation in construction contracts and has recommended appropriate affirmative action steps to be
taken narrowly tailored remedies to eliminate any such discrimination.
Sec. 34-290.

Applicability.

This subdivision shall apply to all construction contracts funded in whole or in part by County
funds, regardless of the sources of other funds; provided that any contract with respect to which a goal for
Minority-Owned Business Enterprise or Women-Owned Business Enterprise participation is inconsistent
with or prohibited by State or Federal law shall be exempt from the goals included in this subdivision.
Sec. 34-291.

Severability.

If any section, subsection, clause or provision of this subdivision is held to be invalid by a court

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011
(a)
Only businesses Businesses that meet the criteria for certification as a an MBE or WBE
may participate in the Program. The applicant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the
evidence.
(b)
Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be
certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in
ownership documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership
and share in the risks and profits commensurate with that ownership interest.

(2)

The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial. If
Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner's
contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally
recognized in a specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to
the firm's potential success, specific to the type of work the firm performs and
documented in the firm's records. The individual whose Expertise is relied upon must
have a commensurate financial investment in the firm.

(c)
Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)

A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary
discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no
restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any
other formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm,
including the making of obligations or the dispersing disbursing of funds.

(2)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day
as well as long-term decisions on management, policy, operations and work.

(3)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of
the management or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must retain the power to hire and fire
any such person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually
exercise control over the firm's operations, work, management and policy.

(4)

The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall
understanding of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise,
directly related to the firm's operations and work. The Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate
information presented by other participants in the firm's activities and to make
independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.

15

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011
(5)

If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a
particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or
credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not
require that the owner posses the license or credential, that the owner(s) lacks such
license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the Socially
and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.

(6)

A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside
employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or
prevent the owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to
manage and control its day to day activities.

(d)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is
one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as
a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is
independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent business Business,
the CC Director will:
(1)

Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel,
facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.

(2)

Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and nonCertified Firms or persons associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the
applicant's independence.

(3)

Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine
whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm
compromises the applicant's independence.

(4)

Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and nonCertified Firms with normal industry practice.

(e)
An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's
operations and work.
(f)
The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and
non-Certified Firms. To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture
must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits
of the Joint Venture which is equal to its ownership interest.. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute
property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of
the work of the contract.
(g)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines
that the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.

16

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011
(h)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the
Office of Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary
documentation with the CC Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i)
It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another
agency. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
(j)

The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility

criteria.
(k)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by
the County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(l)
A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m)
A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(n)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified
Firm as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the
eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the
final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect
until the County CC Director renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-296.

Annual aspirational goals.

The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County construction
contracts and subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and four (4) percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-297.

Project specific goals.

The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals
for construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform
the anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.
Sec. 34-298.

Counting MBE and WBE participation.

(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs
own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE
for the work of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except
supplies and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime
Contractor's Affiliate).
(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a
bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing

17

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011
bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the
fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c)
When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of
the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint
Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is
separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d)
Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function,
the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the
MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or
WBE Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(f)
If a firm ceases to be a certified Certified Firm during its performance on a contract, the
dollar value of work performed under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not
be counted.
(g)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or
WBE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-299.

Contract pre-award compliance procedures.

(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor
requires that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the CC Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1)

Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid
meetings, advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs

18

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011
certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide
interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to
respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations
with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2)

Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to
increase the likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This
includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically
feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own
forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work available
to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the work or material needs
consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their participation.

(3)

Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such
negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and
WBEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding
the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why
agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not
reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a
thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some additional
costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient
reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as
such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the
work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it of the
responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all subcontractable scopes of work
that could be subcontracted.

(4)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of
credit, or insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where
appropriate.

(5)

Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary
equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where
appropriate.

(6)

Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available
minority/women community organizations, minority/women contractors' groups,
government sponsored minority/women business assistance offices and other
appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and placement
of MBEs and WBEs.

(e)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of
other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the
apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be
reasonably questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor
could have met the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet
the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by
other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.

19

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011
(f)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(g)
The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the
scope of work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification
in writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the
opportunity to augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(h)
If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project
Specific Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User
Department, the CC Director and User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent
Department.
(i)
If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the
CC Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing Department and recommend that the
bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest
procedures.
Sec. 34-300.

Contract administration procedures.

(a)

of the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment
submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User
Department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall
have full and timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll
records, tax returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its
commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion
of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision
allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c)
The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs
named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Purchasing Agent
and the User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision
and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause
termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor
to contract penalties or other sanctions.
(1)

All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in
the Utilization Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A
Contractor shall not substitute a MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform the work
designated for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the CC
Director, Purchasing Agent and in consultation with the User Department, approve
approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted
subcontractor to begin work until both the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department have approved the substitution.

20

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011

(2)

The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have
been known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is
prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to
resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of
work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached
for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.

(3)

Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.

(ii)

Failure of performance.

(iii)

Financial incapacity.

(iv)

Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.

(v)

Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation
where agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.

(vi)

Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding
requirements; or

(vii)

The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.

(4)

The County's final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the
basis of any denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.

(5)

Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of
the County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan.
The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in
obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and
Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified
Firm.

(6)

If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the
Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract
Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be
reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a
non-Certified Firm.

(d)
If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously
disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time
they arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.

21

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011
(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of
the contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the
contract's scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE
commitments were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach
of the contract or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the
contract.
Sec. 34-301.

Sanctions and penalties.
The following violations of this subdivision may result in a breach of contract:

NEW PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING WORKERS’ COMPENSATION CLAIMS
WHEREAS, currently when a workplace accident occurs in the County, the injured employee completes
an employee accident report, the employee’s supervisor completes an investigation report and any
witnesses complete witness reports and then an adjuster from Risk Management makes a determination of
whether or not the claim is compensable under the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act; and
WHEREAS, under the current system, the adjusters do not have an opportunity to follow up with the
injured employee to ask questions to help them make a determination, and they instead solely rely on the
accident reports; and
WHEREAS, an employee without insurance experience might not know all of the information an
adjuster needs to make an accurate determination regarding the claim; and
WHEREAS, a system shall be created and implemented that will allow the adjuster to interview the
injured employee either in person or by telephone and record a conversation reviewing the details of the
accident in order to help the adjuster make an accurate determination on the claim; and
WHEREAS, such a system will help employees, who did not do a good job documenting the accident,
get an accurate and appropriate decision regarding their claim and it will help the County discourage and
reject fraudulent claims; and

26

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011

WHEREAS, saving recorded accident interviews will help both the County and the injured employee if
details on the accident are needed in the future and at trial; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Risk Management will be responsible for implementing these new Workers’
Compensation investigatory procedures and will provide the services necessary to accomplish this
purpose; and
WHEREAS, the recordings of investigative interviews shall be preserved by Cook County Risk
Management and the State’s Attorney’s Office shall have access to these recordings when necessary; and
WHEREAS, to facilitate the proper interviewing of all injured employees, this new system shall be
created so as to allow interviews and investigations seven days a week, which will allow all employees to
report alleged work related injuries within 24 hours from the time of the accident; and
WHEREAS, the interview and recording of witnesses shall also be allowed when deemed appropriate by
the facts of a particular case; and
WHEREAS, this Resolution shall in no way obviate the employee’s current requirement to complete a
written accident report immediately following an alleged work injury. Witnesses shall also complete a
written witness statement as is currently the practice; and
WHEREAS, all Departments of Cook County and elected Cook County Offices shall create and
implement rules consistent with the intent of this Resolution.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners that effective immediately or as soon as possible, recorded interviews be conducted
between County adjusters and injured employees, to review and document the details of accidents
immediately (and in any event, no later than 24 hours) following an alleged work related accident.

IN HONOR OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO LOST THEIR LIVES
WHILE DEFENDING OUR NATION THIS MEMORIAL DAY 2011
WHEREAS, formerly known as Decoration Day, Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday of May
in commemoration of the U.S. soldiers who died while in the military service; and
WHEREAS, Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on May 5,1868 by General John Logan, national
commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, in his General Order No. 11, in which he calls: “Let us,
then, at the time appointed gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above
them with the choicest flowers of spring-time; let us raise above them the dear old flag they saved from
dishonor; let us in this solemn presence renew our pledges to aid and assist those whom they have left
among us a sacred charge upon a nation's gratitude, the soldier's and sailor's widow and orphan” and
WHEREAS, Memorial Day was first observed on May 30, 1868, when flowers were placed on the
graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery, and was extended after World
War I to honor Americans who have died in all wars; and
WHEREAS, on May 2, 2000, President Bill Clinton issued a Memorandum on the White House Program
for the National Moment of Remembrance, “encouraging individual department and agency personnel,
and Americans everywhere, to pause for one minute at 3:00 p.m. (local time) on Memorial Day, to
remember and reflect on the sacrifices made by so many to provide freedom for all.” This important step
was followed on December 2000 by the passing of the National Moment of Remembrance Resolution
which asks for all Americans "To voluntarily and informally observe in their own way a moment of
remembrance and respect, pausing from whatever they are doing for a moment of silence or listening to
'Taps’."
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners do hereby recognize Monday, May 30, 2011 as Memorial Day, and join and encourage
all residents of Cook County to renew our pledge to aid the widows, widowers, and orphans of our fallen
dead, to aid the disabled veterans and to commit our minds and hearts to reflect upon the ultimate
sacrifices made by those in service to our country; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this text be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable
Body.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII,
Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and
perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, on December 13, 2010, President Toni Preckwinkle issued Executive Order
2010-1, ordering, among other things, the following actions:
1.

A moratorium on non-essential capital construction projects in the planning
stage with the Office of Capital Improvement and Policy. A list of all

this order as Exhibit A. The moratorium as it relates to Planned Capital
Construction Projects shall continue Capital Improvement Program – 1
pending the passage of the Annual Appropriation Bill for the Fiscal Year
2011, unless further extended. During said moratorium a review of the
planned projects shall be conducted by representatives of the Office of the
President, the Office of Capital Improvement and the affected agency to
determine the strategic and essential nature of the project. Projects deemed
non-essential, i.e., those that are not required for public health or safety
reasons or are necessary to address regulatory requirements and code
violations will be addressed with the Cook County Board of Commissioners
at a later date and may be deferred, restructured or terminated.

2.

A moratorium on any non-essential capital construction projects in the active
stage with the Office of Capital Improvement and Policy. A list of all Active
Capital Construction Projects as of December 9, 2010 is attached to this
order as Exhibit B. The moratorium as it relates to Active Capital
Construction Projects shall continue pending the passage of the Annual
Appropriation Bill for the Fiscal Year 2011, unless further extended. During

WHEREAS, after imposition of the moratorium, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy

review of all Planned Capital Construction Projects and all Active Capital Construction
Projects to determine the strategic and essential nature of each project; and

77

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011

discipline to the planning process, categorizing projects as 1) Life Safety, 2) Code and
Regulatory Requirement, 3) Critical System Risk of Failure, 4) Public Safety, 5) Energy
Efficiency, and 6) Miscellaneous. Based on the initial evaluation, non-essential projects were
placed on hold; and
WHEREAS, President Toni Preckwinkle then initiated an independent third party review of
the capital construction projects by the Public Building Commission of Greater Chicago and
its consultants, all of whom worked in close collaboration with the Office of Capital Planning
and Policy in scrutinizing projects to determine which projects could be deferred, eliminated
or restructured; and
WHEREAS, this joint review resulted in the denial, deferral or restructuring of projects,
generating savings that will be re-allocated to new 2011 projects necessary for life safety and
code requirements, to prevent failure of critical systems, to protect public safety, and to begin
the strategic re-alignment of real estate assets to optimize cost efficiency and facilitate the
improvement of public services; and
WHEREAS, based upon the foregoing actions, Toni Preckwinkle, President of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, the Bureau of Economic Development, by Maria Saldaña,

million of which patient fees were under budget by $28.3 million and DSH payments were
over budget by $4.5 million.
The purpose of this letter is to address the causes of the unfavorable variance to date and what
actions are being taken to adjust the Health System's operation to achieve a balanced budget
by fiscal year-end.

The patient fee revenue budget was based on a number of assumptions related to volumes,
payment rates, payer mix, implementation of the Health System's Strategic Plan: Vision
2015, and the impact of the PricewaterhouseCoopers engagement in the Performance
Improvement Project. As of March 30, 2011, the Health System was on target for inpatient
volumes and payer mix. There was a slight unfavorable variance in outpatient volumes and
in payment rates. Implementation of the Strategic Plan: Vision 2015, while not progressing
as aggressively as originally hoped, is not materially behind schedule; provided, however,
that this will change significantly if we do not discontinue inpatient services on the Oak
Forest campus as planned. The PwC engagement in the Performance Improve Project has
shown significant results in a number of areas.
The overall revenue deficiencies to date appear to lie in the four areas discussed immediately
below. The corrective actions proposed for these deficiencies are addressed later in this
letter.
1.

Medicaid Receivables -- As of November 30, 2010, CCHHS submitted 10,676
eligibility applications to Medicaid. As of March 30, 2011, eligibility applications
pending approval grew to 11,261. The budget assumed that, as a result of
negotiations during late summer, Medicaid would both remain current in processing
receivables and begin reducing the backlog of receivables. Neither of these events
occurred as of March 30, 2011.

2.

Physician Billing Initiative -- CCHHS anticipated that it would begin billing third
parties for services provided by physicians in early FY2011. Because of the
complexity in the implementation of this billing process, CCHHS now anticipates
that physician billing activities will begin yielding revenue in October, 2011. As a
result, a relatively small portion of the budgeted physician billing revenue of $20
million will be received in FY2011.

3.

Performance Improvement Project -- The PwC engagement anticipated that, in early
FY2011, CCHHS would be positioned to aggressively pursue revenue performance
improvement initiatives. A number of factors including: delays in implementation of
information technology changes; delays in hiring; and unanticipated complexity in
correcting or implementing billing processes has slowed the expected growth in
patient service revenue.

87

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 17, 2011
4.

Revenue Cycle Software Migration -- On December 1, 2010, CCHHS migrated its
three Siemens patient billing systems to one single platform. This was necessary in
order to standardize the patient accounting processes throughout the system and to
achieve maximum efficiency within the revenue cycle. As a result of this migration,
it was anticipated that revenues would decline during December and January with a
recovery in February and March of the unbilled backlog of eligibility applications.
The actual recovery of the November, December and January revenues has been
delayed. This is a timing issue. It is anticipated that all accounts payable during this
time will be recovered within the next quarter.

Forecast
The Health System, working with PwC and other advisers, anticipates that the revenue that
has been delayed as a result of the software migration will be recovered within the next
quarter and that some of the anticipated additional revenue will be recovered prior to fiscal
year-end. In spite of this, it is possible that the Health System will have an approximately
$33.9 million unfavorable variance in patient fees by fiscal year-end. This is due primarily to
the concern that Medicaid will be unable to resolve the approximately $40 million in
receivables as
originally anticipated and that CCHHS will not be able to implement physician billing in time
to achieve the full $20 million budgeted revenue.
It is significant to note that this estimated shortfall will be offset, in part, by unanticipated
payments from the following:
Upper Payment Limit -- Medicaid is allowed to pay providers up to a ceiling determined
by the difference between what Medicaid pays and an allowable or upper payment limit
established by other payers. CCHHS has been in negotiations with the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services to recognize this differential. It is anticipated that
Medicaid will pay CCHHS between $20 million and $25 million within the next 90 days
as a result of these negotiations. These revenues were not included in the FY2011 budget
because there was significant uncertainty as to whether these funds would be available.

Medicare Settlement -- On April 15, 2011, CCHHS completed its Medicare cost reports
for 2010 and recorded a receivable of $4.978 million with an anticipated settlement
payment of $3.5 million to CCHHS within the next 90 days. This settlement was not
included in the budget because the outcome of the cost report process was unknown.
The above combined unanticipated revenue ranges from $23.5 million and $25 million and
payment is expected within the next 90 days. However, only $20 million has a high
probability of recovery. As stated above, it is possible that the Health System will have an
approximately $33.9 million unfavorable variance in patient fees by fiscal year-end. This
anticipated loss in the current period revenue is offset by these additional unanticipated
revenues resulting in an approximately $14 million shortfall by the end of FY2011, as set
forth in the chart immediately below.

Corrective Action
Recognizing that CCHHS has an obligation to balance its budget, management is currently
taking steps to reduce its operating expenses by an additional $14 million. The analysis of
current expenditures indicates that the system is under budget in most expense categories.
While overtime pay is exceeding budget, total wages are under budget. Management has
committed to the CCHHS Board of Directors to reduce its overtime payments by July, 2011.
At this time, it is anticipated that the additional $14 million in expense reductions will be
absorbed through under spending or the reduction of certain line items within the budget.
The proposed list of reductions will be presented to the CCHHS Board of Directors at its
May, 2011 meeting.
Conclusion
The approximately $33.9 million anticipated loss in patient fees effects FY2011 only. As the
initiatives for physician billing, outpatient billing and charge capture are implemented, these
revenues will be recovered by CCHHS in future years. While the current unfavorable
variance as of March 30, 2011 is alarming, CCHHS anticipates that approximately half of the
variance will be recovered before fiscal year-end with the remaining $14 million absorbed
through the reduction of operating expenses.
It should be noted that total revenues continue to grow. The graph below shows that revenues
decreased from a high of $517 million in FY2006 to a low of $420 million in FY2008. The
retroactive DSH payment benefit received in FY2009 contributed to the almost $668.5
million in revenue for FY2009 while the Health System generated $539.7 million in FY2010.
The original FY2011 revenue budget anticipated $638.5 million and is now decreased to
$624.6 million.
