 Police Board Public Meeting - February 28, 2018

1

Pursuant to Section 2-78-130 of

2

the Municipal Code of Chicago, I considered one

3

matter on which the Chief Administrator of the

4

Civilian Office of Police Accountability and

5

the Superintendent of Police did not agree

6

regarding the discipline of two police

7

officers.

8

Request for review numbers 18 RR

9

01 and 02 involve allegations that Police

10

Officers Richard Caro and Benjamin Garcia

11

stopped an individual without justification in

12

violation of the 4th Amendment and Police

13

Department policy.

14

The Chief Administrator

15

recommended sustaining the allegations and

16

suspending both officers for 12 days.

17

superintendent recommended classifying the

18

allegations as exonerated.

19

The

After reviewing this matter, I

20

find the Superintendent met the burden of

21

overcoming the Chief Administrator's

22

recommendations for discipline; therefore,

23

according to the Municipal Code of Chicago, the

24

Superintendent's recommendation will be
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

implemented.

2

A copy of the written opinion

3

will be posted on the Board's website as

4

required by the Municipal Code.

5

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

The Board is also

6

providing notice tonight that it plans to

7

consider amendments to its Rules of Procedures.

8

A draft of the proposed amendments will be

9

posted on the Board's website.

And it is our

10

hope, we'll post the proposed rules, changes on

11

our website, and you will have an opportunity

12

to review it and provide comment, and we will

13

take final action on those changes in a future

14

meeting.

15

The general orders and other

16

directives issued by the Superintendent during

17

the previous month are listed in the books made

18

available at this evening's meeting and also

19

posted on the Police Department's website.

20

The next item is the

21

Superintendent's report to the Board.

22

tonight is First Deputy Riccio.

FIRST DEPUTY RICCIO:
President.

With us

Sir.

Thank you, Madam

I just want to briefly comment.

 Police Board Public Meeting - February 28, 2018

1

Actually, this is my one-month anniversary in

2

this position, and so I am feeling my way

3

around.

4

Prior to this, I was Chief of

5

Organized Crime.

And I'm very happy to be here

6

this evening.

7

of the public for giving me the opportunity to

8

speak.

And thank the Board and members

I will keep it very brief.

9

As residents of this City, we all

10

share a common role in keeping the City safe,

11

and we all want safe neighborhoods.

12

want to let you know that the officers of this

13

Department have worked hard this year, as in

14

the past, to achieve that goal.

15

And I just

This year our murders are down

16

actually 22 percent, which is a nice reduction.

17

That's on top of the nice reduction that we had

18

last year, as well.

19

Shootings almost across the

20

entire City are down.

Citywide they're down 28

21

percent.

22

hundred fewer shooting victims now than there

23

were at this time last year.

24

proud of that.

And that represents more than a

So we're very

800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

10

 Police Board Public Meeting - February 28, 2018

1

The other statistics, I'm not

2

going to bore you with statistics, is the guns

3

we recovered this year.

4

recovered -- and mind you, we're only in

5

February, 1,247 illegal firearms were recovered

6

so far.

7

Officers have

And that's on pace almost exactly

8

to where we were last year.

And last year was

9

a record year, we recovered more than 8,000

10

guns last year.

11

were recovered represents an armed encounter,

12

we're encountering an armed subject and a

13

subject who could easily shoot to kill an

14

officer or others if the officers didn't

15

intervene.

16

Every one of those guns that

So I just want to give you guys a

17

quick snapshot of where we are.

18

successes, these reductions in shootings are

19

across the board, they're across the City;

20

they're not just in certain neighborhoods,

21

they're in virtually all neighborhoods.

22

And in these

In fact, some of the

23

neighborhoods impacted the most are

24

neighborhoods that in the past have been the

most violent.

showing some of the greatest reductions.

3
4

Those are the ones that are

So burglaries, robberies all
significantly down this year.

5

So we're very proud of the work

6

that the men and women of this Department have

7

been doing.

8
9

And my final comment, the
Superintendent, himself, wanted to be here.

He

10

was in Springfield yesterday and today actually

11

got back a short time ago, and the man is

12

exhausted.

13

was down in Springfield meeting with the

14

General Assembly pushing for some legislation

15

that we think will make this city even safer as

16

it relates to the sale of guns, as it relates

17

to the possession of guns, as it relates to the

18

possession of body armor, as it relates to

19

extended magazines, which we've seen so many

20

tragedies, including the one most recently down

21

in Florida.

22

He's been working long days.

He

So every bill that the

23

Superintendent went down and asked to -- or

24

show support for, believing that those will

told the governor is also going to sign those

6

bills.

7

They're

And we've been

So we're optimistic that the

8

City's going to continue moving in the

9

direction to be a safer place for everyone.

10
11
12
13

So that will close out my
comments.

Thank you.

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

Thank you, First

Deputy.

14

At this time, I'll now call upon

15

those members of the public who have signed up

16

in advance to speak.

Good evening, ma'am.

MS. LANDHUIS:

My name is Shaina Landhuis,

7

and I am a part of the #MeToo, #PoliceToo,

8

#TheyKnow movement that is shedding light on

9

sexual assaults perpetrated by police officers.

10

I would like to read an excerpt

11

from police sexual abuse of teenage girls, a

12

2003 update on Driving While Female by Samuel

13

Walker and Dawn Irlbeck.

14

Police sexual abuse of women

15

includes a disturbing pattern of police officer

16

exploitation of teenage girls.

17

these cases involve girls who are enrolled in

18

police department-sponsored programs designed

19

to give teens an understanding of police work.

20

The majority of

The common theme in all sexual

21

abuse cases in both reports is police officers

22

using their law enforcement authority to take

23

advantage of vulnerable people, including

24

persons stopped for traffic violations, sex

workers and teenage girls.

2

A total of 183 cases of police

3

sexual abuse of women over a period of 12 years

4

have been identified.

5

40 percent of those cases involve

6

teenage girls or boys.

7

involve traffic enforcement cases.

8

involve police sexual abuse of sex workers.

9

34 percent of the total
And 9 cases

While these are staggering

10

numbers, the full extent of police officer

11

sexual involvement with teenage girls is not

12

known.

13

Many cases are undoubtedly not

14

reported, either because of shame or fear of

15

retaliation on the part of the victim.

16

The 2003 report also found seven

17

new cases involving police officers coercing

18

sexual favors from sex workers typically in

19

return for not arresting them.

20

In several cases, it is alleged

21

that the police chief or other departmental

22

officials failed to investigate complaints of

23

sexual misconduct about an officer in the

24

department.

retaliated against the victim who complained

about sexual abuse.

I'm here today to introduce this
study into public record.

3

This report was created with a

grant from the Office of Violence Against

Women, which is part of the U.S. Department of

6

Justice.

The grant was given to the

The name of this report is Addressing Sexual

10

Offenses and Misconduct By Law Enforcement,

11

Executive Guide, #CopsToo, #PoliceToo,

12

#TheyKnow, #NothingHappened.

13

The purpose of this guide is to

14

help regional law enforcement create training

15

and accountability systems so that rape,

16

assaults and all unwanted sexual behavior will

17

be punishable and therefore much less likely to

18

occur.

I'm going to read the
introduction and then I'll hand in this report.
Introduction:

The problem of

22

sexual misconduct by officers warrants the full

23

attention of law enforcement leadership.

24

represents a grave abuse of authority and

17

1

violation of the civil rights of those that

2

victimized.

3

Law enforcement agencies and

4

executives have a duty to prevent sexual

5

victimization, to ensure it is not perpetrated

6

by the officers, and to take every step

7

possible to to ensure the safety and dignity of

8

everyone in the community.

9

When an incident of sexual

10

misconduct involving the law enforcement

11

officer is reported, it presents one of the

12

most difficult challenges a law enforcement

13

executive can face; therefore, it is imperative

14

that executives prepare through agency mission,

15

policy and training to proactively address and

16

prevent incidents.

17

Leaders must demonstrate to their

18

officers and their community a consistent,

19

focused effort to identify and eliminate

20

misconduct through the institutionalization of

21

a zero tolerance position.

Yes.

Hi.

I work with the

Alliance Against Racist Political Oppression,

8

and I am a market research analyst and

9

investigative journalist.

10

My questions are first, how many

11

of you know that Rahm Emanuel's father was a

12

member of the Irgun terrorist group responsible

13

for murdering millions of people in Israel in

14

the '30s.

15

Okay.

Good.

How many of you know that 911 was

16

an inside job, and we know who in this country

17

was responsible for covering it up?

18

How many of you know that the FOP

19

media relations person admitted on the witness

20

stand the night of -- regarding the Jason Van

21

Dyke hearing, that the night of the Laquan

22

McDonald hearing, he does what he always does,

23

which is get together with the two other FOP

24

people and make up a lie and tell that to the

public?

2

Is this something you know?

3

Probably not, because it's covered up.

4

a code of silence that means cover-up.

Everything is lies and cover-up.

this crowd here is here protesting.

There's

And what's going to

It will be covered up by internal

12

This -- the corruption starts at

13

the top, the code of silence.

It's in this

14

report, crime, corruption and cover-ups.

15

It is the intention of the

16

Chicago Police Department to keep these things

17

silent and covered up.

18

Madigan and the community have to get a

19

judicial consent decree to require total

20

transparency.

21

And that's why Lisa

I was a teacher.

If I was lying

about the grades that the person got, they

would protest.

That is an abuse of power.

Now,

7

it's one thing to tell someone they can't take

pictures up here, it is quite another to try

and take them physically from her.

That is

wrong.

Tell someone that they can't have the

physically take something from someone.

You don't try to

That's what's wrong with this

It is a sham.

It's disgusting.
Our next speaker is

Pamela Hunt.
MS. HUNT:

Good evening to the Board.

11

issue is racism and discrimination.

12

think you all know where I stand on that.

13

And I

But let me make a comment.

14

I was here last, I talked about Rahm being

15

Jewish, and I somehow was accused of being

16

anti-Semitic.

17

My

When

So let me be clear.
I'm saying that if what occurred

18

to a Jewish community, what's going on with the

19

black community, the police abuse and assault,

20

I'm saying clearly if that was the Jewish

21

community, I'm saying Rahm would behave

22

differently.

23

Israeli Army in here to deal with the Chicago

24

Police Department.

I said that Rahm would call the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

27

 Police Board Public Meeting - February 28, 2018

1

So let's be clear about that.

2

is not hate.

3

that statement.

4

new executive leader in here.

5

different attitude.

I'm not going to stand down on

6

Rahm needs to go.

We get a

We get a whole

Superintendent Johnson, I wish he

7

were here.

8

some people aren't fit to live.

9

statement was made in talking about the

10

It

I'm disgusted by his remark that
And that

shooter -- the shooter of Paul Bauer.

11

I understand that sentiment.

12

I understand the Police Department is in

13

mourning.

14

is Superintendent Johnson to state that

15

somebody isn't fit to live?

But here's my concern.

16

Let me ask this:

And

Who the hell

Is John Burge

17

fit to live?

Is Bettie Jones -- the murderer

18

of Bettie Jones' mother, is he fit to live?

19

Those police officers in New York

20

that I saw murder Eric Gardner, are they fit to

21

live?

22

it's seen as a threat.

23
24

But if the public makes that statement,

So someone needs to check
Superintendent Johnson on his behavior and his

800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

28

 Police Board Public Meeting - February 28, 2018

1

professionalism when he is at the mic.

2

Last thing I got to say.

He goes

3

to -- he goes to Illinois -- he goes to

4

Springfield, and he is able to advocate and get

5

bills and legislations passed because

6

of Paul -- Commander Paul Bauer's murder.

7

I understand that hurt, but that is the same

8

hurt that the community feels when we lose

9

someone.

And

We can't even get us a bill on board.

10

We can't even get that implemented, but he can

11

get a bill and legislation passed in two days.

12

Last a question for you, Attorney

13

Lightfoot.

14

FOP?

Have you met with Kevin Graham of

Kevin Graham.

15

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

16

MS. HUNT:

No, I have not.

requests.

at his interview, because they're now fighting

19

body cams.

I asked the Board members, go look

President and members of the Board.

apologize for that.

I

I didn't know that I

couldn't bring the pictures in here.

11

pictures of me from the age of 13 until I was

12

19.

13

here, they should have told me at the check-in.

They were

I don't -- I'm not the type of
person that causes trouble.

I got in -- made mistakes

throughout my life.

how my parents raised me.

And she really could

30

1

have said that a better way.

2

As I was saving, good evening to

3

you all.

I didn't prepare a speech like I did

4

the first time because I wanted to speak

5

directly from my heart.

6

stand up here because I don't want what that

7

officer just did to me to really affect me up

8

here.

9

start speaking without getting emotional, but

10

this has been an emotional 30 something years

11

for me.

And I'm trying to

I tried -- said I was going to try to

12

And I wanted to just tell briefly

13

of how Officer Kevin Glover stalked me.

That's

14

why I brought the pictures.

15

took my glasses off, and that's why I'm

16

standing here in front of you all now, because

17

I want you to see the sincerity in my eyes.

18

want you to feel my heart and feel my soul.

19

I know it's been 30 something

And that's why I

years.

apologize to everybody.

any problems.

23

No violence.

here before you all to ask you all to please

I'm not here to cause

1

help me.

I want an investigation.

2

because my childhood, my teenage years was

3

taken from me by Officer Glover.

4

I want one

And as far as I was worried that

5

once I was placed in front of a lineup or the

6

pictures or whatever, that I wasn't going to

7

recognize him, I recognized him in 10.5

8

seconds, because he still looks the same.

9

just got a little heavier.

His hair is

10

curlier, and he has sideburns.

11

him out quickly.

12

He

And I picked

And this it is not easy for me,

13

you all.

This is bringing up some pain for

14

years that I buried.

I thought I buried it.

15

I know I'm supposed to speak for

16

two minutes, but 30 something years of pain is

17

worth more than two minutes.

18

And I don't want to have to

19

endure what I just endured from that officer,

20

because I never -- you all look at my

21

background.

22

didn't turn my life around and work in social

23

services for almost 16 years for nothing.

24

Yes, I made mistakes.

But I

I didn't -- I dealt with every

type of people there are, and I can get on my

I will have about 300 likes and about 200

my character as a person and my character as a

woman, my character as a mother and character

as a grandmother.

10

I am really going through
something.

And I'm asking you all for your

help to investigate.

11

years and age all that, but I'm telling you

13

all, this man made my teenage years a living

hell.

15

pictures, because guess what?

16

them pictures that was packed up in my mother's

17

and father's stuff.

18

them, because I wanted to put them on my wall.

19

And the only pictures I have of my twin brother

20

and I.

21

that's all I have of me and my brother.

That's why I wanted you all to see the
I just found

And I've been looking for

Everything else I lost in storage.

And

22

And I wanted you all to see them

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

Ms. Townsend --

I'm sorry.
No need to apologize.

10

I think I speak for the Board in recognizing

11

your courage in coming forward, both at the

12

last meeting and today, we understand the

13

challenge that you face in coming to the public

14

with your story.

15

It's my understanding, and I

16

think you suggested yourself, that there is an

17

active investigation that's going on.

18

So you stay diligent.

We will

19

stay diligent, and we'll see where it takes us.

20

You know there's been a significant passage of

21

time.

22

But I'm looking at Chief Welch in

will follow the evidence where it leads them.

MS. TOWNSEND:

Thank you.

Can I say one

more thing?

8

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

9

MS. TOWNSEND:

Sure.

About a week and a half ago,

10

I was on WVON -- my lawyer got me on the WVON

11

1690 show.

12

After we had finished, Officer

13

Glover called in and told Betty Jackson to tell

14

me that I'm slandering his name.

15

live post on my Facebook page, and I made it

16

public so he can see it, because I feel in my

17

heart that this man has been following me and

18

watching me.

19
20

I feel this.

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

MS. TOWNSEND:

22

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

24

I feel this.

Obviously you need to

report that.

21

23

So I made a

I'm sorry.
Obviously if you feel

threatened, you need to report that.
MS. TOWNSEND:

I feel I'm being watched,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

35

 Police Board Public Meeting - February 28, 2018

1

because he made -- he waited until I finished,

2

then he called in and said that I'm slandering

3

his name.

4

asked him to step forward as a man and come and

5

face these allegations that I'm saying before

6

you.

So if I'm slandering his name, I

7

He is a decorated officer.

Come

8

stand before me and face in front of me and

9

look me in my eyes and tell me that you didn't

10

rape me and tell me that you never raped anyone

11

else.

MS. NOEL:

Good evening, everyone.

Lori,

18

first of all, I want to thank you for pointing

19

out that there are many victims of gun violence

20

and for having a moment of silence for all

21

victims of gun violence and not just Commander

22

Bauer.

23
24

I think that it is rather
insensitive for Rahm Emanuel to just pop up and
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

36

 Police Board Public Meeting - February 28, 2018

1

name the police academy after Commander Bauer.

2

I was here in 2011 when five

3

police officers were shot and killed.

4

all -- they never canceled a Police Board

5

meeting.

6

One, we

Two, there were a lot of black

7

officers that were killed.

8

on the Board.

9

up at a cabinet with a white man's name on it.

10

I think that's unacceptable in that community.

11

So I'm putting this

You have black children looking

So you can call that building

12

Commander Paul Bauer Building, but that campus

13

better be Thomas Wortham, III, Campus.

14

hear what I'm saying?

15

III, had a father who was a police officer, and

16

he was shot and killed on the street by four

17

different individuals, and he deserves to have

18

his name on that campus.

19

young black children to see a black name on

20

that campus as well.

You

Because Thomas Wortham,

And I want those

21

I don't mind the building, but

22

you better have Thomas Wortham, III, Campus.

23

That's one.

24

Two.

I know that we couldn't

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

37

 Police Board Public Meeting - February 28, 2018

1

bring in signs, but I don't know nothing about

2

pictures.

3
4
5

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

We'll get that sorted

out.
MS. NOEL:

Okay.

But this shows

6

insensitivity.

7

sexual assault victims coming through here.

8

Okay?

9

taken away from her.

10

And this is why we don't want

Because she needs power back, not power

Whenever you're reading about

11

training and interviewing sexual assault

12

victims, they say the first thing you need to

13

do is give their power back.

14

advocate for her.

15

And now I'm an

And the first thing that IAD said

16

to me when I told him are you going to see

17

this, no, you know you can't come in.

18

not his to decide.

19

decide.

20

taken.

That's

That's Trina's, Kim's to

So it's all wrong.

It needs to be

21

Last, SB5955, I don't know if

22

you're aware, but 35 states allow anyone in

23

custody raped.

24

they have somebody in custody and say it was

Police officers can rape if

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

38

 Police Board Public Meeting - February 28, 2018

1

consensual.

2
3

So SB5955 is now on the docket to
stop that from happening.

4

And as an FYI, if the FOP has any

5

problem with stopping the ability of police

6

officers to rape women while they're in

7

custody, just let me know.

8

Come right out and just tell me that we want to

9

continue to be able to rape people in custody.

Just let me know.

10

Just let me know, and I'll make sure that you

11

will never say nothing again.

12

PRESIDENT LIGHTFOOT:

13

MS. NOEL:

Thank you.

That's all FOP people.

14

One last thing.

15

you all know that last year, the statute of

16

limitations was eliminated on minors, right?

17

So anyone under 17 or anyone under 16.

18

I don't know if

So my question is, why are

19

children still being arrested for prostitution?

20

Or sex working?

21
22
23
24

So they can't give consent, stop
arresting them.

What you all did to him is

just -- it's sad.

He was a decent individual,

corruption and cover-up center.

But it

I know you don't want no violence

in these streets.

I'm still waiting on the gun

turn-in that I snatched from a 13-year-old boy

9

in January.

I don't know what you thought they

10

were going to do with they holiday money.

11

it's on the street.

12

But

If you really want to make a

13

difference in these streets, you need to come

14

to those of us that are in the streets making a

15

difference.

16

We cannot and do not respect you,

17

because you don't make recommendations in our

18

best interests, period, so therefore you cannot

19

properly represent us, and you don't properly

20

represent us.

21

We got a $10 billion budget.

You

all got $2 million.

We need some of that money

serious situation out at Morgan Park High

School that needs the same attention that the

white north side schools are receiving.

as simple as that.

It's

11/27/2007 I filed this complaint

2

with the U.S. District Attorney's Office, and

3

it started over a relationship with Ann Heart,

4

and she involved -- she was -- had cop

5

cover-up, and it escalated to a big mess.

6

Recently -- I live in senior

citizen building.

8

9

anything to do with organized crime.

10

even know anything about it, period.

11

I'm 66 years old.

I've

I never had
I don't

There have been several gangs

12

around my building stalking me and following me

13

around, which they've gotten down to a minimum

14

now, and was coming from police cover-up, from

15

what I've been told, covering up for the gangs.

16

I've been going through this

17

since 2003.

And I think it's ridiculous.

I

18

have a whole stack of reports.

19

Superintendent Johnson, I started in the field,

20

administration, I went to Dana Starks,

21

McCarthy.

22

And this has been going on for years and years.

And I cannot get an answer from anybody.

And I heard that -- and I'm

2

seeing evidence of two of the people in my

3

building that cops brought them in to lie on me

4

and awarded them money enough to get them brand

5

new cars.

6

But I went back to the U.S.

7

District Attorney's Office in February and

8

filed another complaint, and they found that

9

the police were tied up in drugs and helping

10

the gangs.

can get an answer from someone.
