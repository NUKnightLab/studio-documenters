During the discussion of the information on the Infusion Clinic Review, Chairman Velasquez inquired
regarding other audits planned for the future by Corporate Compliance. Ms. Bodnar responded that the
Department plans to look at some evaluation and management of outpatient activity; this involves evaluation
and management codes and outpatient procedures. A probe review will be done; she has proposed looking at 25
providers and 25 claims. She has just started to discuss the plans for the review, and will be speaking with
Debra Carey, Chief Operating Officer, Ambulatory Services, and Dr. Claudia Fegan, Executive Medical
Director/Medical Director-Stroger, to see if perhaps there are certain areas that they would like Corporate
Compliance to look at. Chairman Velasquez stated that, in addition, she would like an audit done on ICD-10;
she is aware that the organization has embraced ICD-10, but the Committee needs to know how it is being
implemented. Ms. Bodnar responded affirmatively; she will work with the Finance Department to plan and
