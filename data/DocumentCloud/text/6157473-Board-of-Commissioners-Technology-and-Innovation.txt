PROPOSED RESOLUTION AMENDED
CONSOLIDATION OF COOK COUNTY’S TECHNOLOGY
WHEREAS, Cook County has struggled for years to seek out the best approach to
address the technology requirements of all entities under the auspices of the
County; and
WHEREAS, there has been resistance among some elected officials to
consolidate into the County’s main technology system due to concerns with
privacy; and
WHEREAS, it has become evident that the County cannot continue financially to
fund separate or proprietary technology plans for different agencies and
departments under the umbrella of the County; and

WHEREAS, technology funding outside of the Bureau of Technology is significant:
automation funding is $30 million with 240 FTE’s; document storage costs are $26
million with 192 FTE’s; and technology related to the 260 and 579 accounts is over
$50 million annually; and
WHEREAS, it is clear that consolidation across all areas of technology will
improve efficiencies and save the County money, in 2010 the Bureau of
Technology will save $700,000 by consolidating the iSeries system into the
mainframe and $450,000 by transitioning phone system maintenance to existing
staff; and
WHEREAS, of paramount importance in the consolidation process are privacy
issues for independent elected officials, and ensuring the integrity and
confidentiality of important information. The Bureau of Technology has already
proven this can be accomplished as has been done in Maricopa, Los Angeles and
Miami Dade Counties in their IT consolidation programs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board previously approved the consolidated
approach to hardware, software and technology related services, the County must
now take the next step to consolidate all technology investments, systems and
applications.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Bureau of Technology will
prepare to centralize technology throughout the County by: preparing an
Enterprise Architectural Plan for all County IT operations; consolidate all IT
spending including oversight of special purpose funds; continue to build a disaster
recovery site; convert historical paper records to electronic format along with other
necessary steps and present it to the President and Board of Commissioners prior
to the 2011 budget process for implementation into the 2011 budget.; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all departments, bureaus and agencies under
the President, and all office of County Elected Officials, are hereby directed to
provide the Chief Information Officer, on or before February 25, 2010, April 20,
2010, with detailed information identifying all county staff who are employed in
automation or technology related jobs, by job titles and position codes from the
2010 Executive Budget and including the sources of funding for their salary
(general funds, grant funds or special purpose funds) and a description of their
duties and responsibilities as they pertain to information technology; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Information Officer will prepare a
report containing an analysis of the information collected under this directive, said
report to be submitted to the President and Board of Commissioners on March 16,
2010 May 4, 2010.
*Referred as amended to the Committee on Information Technology and
