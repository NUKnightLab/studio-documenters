BOARD ACTIONS
1.

Chairman Gierut called the case. General Counsel Post noted that Executive Director Brosnan issued a dismissal
on November 17, 2011, and an appeal had been filed. General Counsel Post reviewed the issues raised by the
appeal. General Counsel Post recommended the Executive Director's dismissal be affirmed because Charging Party

accept the Executive Director's dismissal. Member Sadlowski seconded the motion, and the Board passed it
unanimously, by a voice vote.

Chairman Gierut called the case. General Counsel Post noted that on December 29, 2011, Executive Director
Brosnan dismissed the charge which alleged a breach of the duty of fair representation. General Counsel Post
stated that Charging Party's appeal had failed to demonstrate intentional misconduct by Respondent, and he
therefore recommended that the Board accept the Executive Director's dismissal. After discussion, Member
Anderson made a motion to accept the Executive Director's dismissal. Member Sadlowski seconded the motion,
and the Board passed it unanimously, by a voice vote.
VI.
