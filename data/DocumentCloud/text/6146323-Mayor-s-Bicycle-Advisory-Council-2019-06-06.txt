 Region Overview
●
●
●
●
●

●

Total Population: 455,000 +
Economic Context: According to the Chicago Health Atlas, most of the neighborhoods
in this region experience high economic hardship
Dense neighborhoods on the southwest side with Little Village being the densest
Predominantly Latinx neighborhoods, though neighborhoods such as Garfield Ridge are
predominately white.
Most of the neighborhoods in this region used to be predominately white and white
flight in the mid-20th century ushered in demographic change. Some of the newest
Latinx neighborhoods are in the southwest side.
Brighton Park, for example, did not start become majority Latinx until the 1990s.

Bike Network Issues/ Challenges
●

●
●

●
●

Truck traffic/industry
○ Community groups like LVEJO have
brought up the issue of heavy truck
traffic making it unsafe for residents.
Industrial parts of the community making it
unsafe to bike
Street infrastructure riddled with potholes and
stretches of the community have poor lighting
at night
Few low-stress routes for cyclists
Lack of safe crossings of the Sanitary and Ship
Canal

 MBAC Community Region Priorities
● Address how industry and truck traffic
is connected to creating livable streets
● Discuss environmental pollution in the
area and how it connects to bike
connectivity and safety
● Develop recommendations for safe
crossings along the the Sanitary and
Ship Canal with consideration to
environmental and transportation
challenges in the southwest side

 BIKE NETWORK ISSUES / CHALLENGES
●
●

●

●
●
●

Lack of bike infrastructure does not give
residents safe routes to bike
Streets like Pulaski and Cicero are
unwelcoming to pedestrians and bicyclists
alike
Region includes streets that connect residents
from north to south sides of the region, as well
as east/west streets that lead directly to the
loop, however majority lack bike routes.
Number of streets need to be repaved
Safety
○ High crash communities/corridors
Other pressing concerns
○ Living wages
○ Education
○ Housing
○ Safe neighborhoods

 MBAC COMMUNITY REGION
PRIORITIES
● Engage West region stakeholders
○ Bicycling efforts
○ Is bicycling a priority? Why or why not?

●
●
●
●

Become familiar with process of implementing bike routes
Cultivate a collaborative effort to inspire a new narrative around bicycling
Incorporate bicycling into annual community events
Address safety concerns of streets like Cicero and Pulaski

 ●

●

NEXT STEPS
Rolling forward!

●

●

Find out how many residents within .5
and 1 mile radius have access to bike
infrastructure.
Identify ongoing and upcoming
streetscape projects and inquire about
bike infrastructure.
Survey west region to identify partners,
plans, or projects that may want to
considering bike infrastructure.
Partner with community stakeholders on
potential development projects to
advocate for bike infrastructure.

Mayor’s Bicycle Advisory Council
June 6, 2019

 What We’ve Heard….
•

Interest in high quality jobs for the community, particularly in agriculture
and food manufacturing.

•

Traffic congestion and truck traffic, particularly along 31 st Street is a
public safety concern.

•

Proposed changes to the Sustainable Development Policy need to be
effective in addressing air quality.

•

An understanding of how land use changes may affect housing
affordability.

• A strong desire for more time in the project schedule to allow for
additional community feedback.
•

Simultaneous translation should provided at public meetings.

Design Guidelines

 

ED ESTRIAN

ACCE SS

Provide clear pedestrian access
from the public way and park-
ing areas to all main building
entrances. Active uses such

as of?ce space should face

the public way to enhance the
pedestnan scale of the build-
ing. Proposed developments at
intersections should coordinate
with CDOT to provide pedestri-
an safety improvements such
as newADA ramps and high
visibility crosswalks.

 

BICYCLE ACCESS
Bicycle parking should be
provided at highly visible areas
near building entrances. Per
the Chicago Sustainable Devl-
opment Policy. conisder pro-
viding indoor bike parking and
showers for employees.
Coordinate with CDOT for po-
tenital placement or relocation
of Divvy stations.
