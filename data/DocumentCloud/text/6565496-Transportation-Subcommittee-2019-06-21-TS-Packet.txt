 by Madison Township. Mr. May reviewed project comments from NOACA staff and BPAC
which were forwarded to the sponsor.
A motion was made by Mr. Ben Capelle to recommend the 4th quarter PPR to PPC. The
motion was seconded by Mr. Rick Switalski. The motion passed by voice vote.
Plan and TIP Amendments; 4th Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2019
Mr. May presented information on the following Plan and TIP amendments:
•

Major rehabilitation of US-20 in Madison Township (LAK US-20 – 24.99 PID
No. 109270)

•

Replacing the bridge on Bundysburg Road in Parkman Township (GEA
BUNDYSBURG RD: PID No. 94371)

Mr. May stated that the total cost of the proposed projects to be amended to the Plan and
TIP is $17.2 million. He noted that the projects will receive funding provided by the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and administered through ODOT. He stated that with
Board adoption, the amendments will be incorporated into the NOACA Plan and/or
statewide TIP amendment in July.
A motion was made by Engineer Conrad to recommend the 4th quarter Plan and TIP
amendments to PPC. The motion was seconded by Ms. Traci Clark. The motion passed
by voice vote.
SFY 2020 Annual Priority List
Mr. May stated that the 2020 Annual Priority List includes 31 projects totaling $50.5 million
and debt service payments for previously approved State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) loans.
Mr. May noted that the projects are categorized as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Shared use - $3.8 million
Signals - $3.5 million
Streetscape - $0.9 million
Transit - $4.8 million

 Functional Classification Amendments
Mr. Mike Kubek presented information on two functional classification amendment
requests submitted to NOACA:
•

State Road (SR 94) - Downgrade from minor arterial (FC=4) to major
collector (FC=5) - the total mileage is 1.46 miles

•

Auburn Road (CR 4) - Downgrade from a major collector (FC=05) to a local
road (FC=07) between the Portage County Line (Harner Road) and
Washington Street (CR 606)

Mr. Kubek reviewed the functional classification three-step process.
Mr. Kubek stated that NOACA is recommending changing SR 94 to a major collector and
changing CR 4 to a local road. He noted that following Board adoption, staff will forward
the recommendations to ODOT and FHWA for further review and approval.
Mr. Romancak asked if the City of North Royalton is okay with the proposed change to
State Road. Mr. Kubek said State Road will remain on the federal-aid system.
Mr. Andrew Cross asked who requested the functional classification changes and what
would be accomplished by the changes. Mr. Kubek stated that ODOT requested the
changes; he noted that the functional class for SR 94 needs to be changed to fit the criteria
and CR 4 needs to be changed because of an error.
Ms. Gallucci provided background on the previous process for functional classification
amendments and talked about the current process which requires Board approval. She
mentioned that NOACA accepts requests from ODOT and the communities.
Ms. Gallucci asked Mr. Kubek why ODOT requested the change to SR 94. Mr. Kubek
said SR 94 does not meet the functional class criteria because it connects to a lower
functional classification.
Ms. Gallucci stated that when ODOT did its review a few years ago, it looked at removing
about 200 miles of roadway from the federal-aid system. At that time, NOACA presented
the requests to the committees and staff did multiple reviews and did not recommend all
of ODOT’s requests.
Mr. Kubek mentioned that staff spoke to Engineer Joe Cattell who agreed with the
proposed change to CR 4.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA will ensure that all requests meet the requirements and
will not make a change simply because someone wants a road added to the federal-aid
system to have access to funding.
A motion was made by Mr. Nick Gorris to recommend the functional classification
amendments to PPC. The motion was seconded by Mr. Switalski. The motion passed by
voice vote.

 Subcommittee Focus Areas
Mr. Kubek reviewed the purpose, functions, 2018 focus areas, and the following 2019
focus areas for the Subcommittee:
•
•
•
•
•
•

SFY 2021-2024 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) (new)
Long-Range Transportation Plan development (new)
Policies and strategies to manage urban sprawl
Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan update
Regional ITS Architecture update
Functional classification recommendations

Mr. Kubek stated that meeting agendas and materials will be crafted to accomplish the
identified focus areas for the Subcommittee.
NOACA SFY 2021-2024 TIP Development Update – Projects for NOACA Controlled
Funds
Mr. Mike Daugherty provided background on the TIP and reviewed the elements of the
program. He noted that the TIP update was originally planned for SFY 2020-2023. ODOT
delayed the STIP/TIP development process by one year due to the uncertainty of federal
funding, revised the timeframe to SFY 2021-2024, and urged NOACA to proceed with its
adoption of agency funded projects according to the original schedule.
Mr. Daugherty stated that NOACA staff met with representatives of all five counties and
the City of Cleveland to review the accuracy of the projects. He noted that NOACA’s
Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program and Transportation Alternatives
Program (TAP) have a total of $80 million available for SFY 2021-2024. CMAQ funded
projects have already been approved through SFY 2024. He mentioned that NOACA
received 212 project requests from 50 communities totaling $301 million. He noted that
the total cost of the projects is $608 million.
Mr. Daugherty reviewed the criteria used to evaluate qualifying projects. He noted that
staff looked at regional connectivity factors, weight factors, scoring, consistency with
NOACA plans, NOACA Diversity and Inclusion Policies, and urbanized versus rural area
projects.
Mr. Daugherty stated that project funding recommendations will be presented to the
Planning and Programming Committee (PPC) for action on April 12, 2019. He noted that
if the TIP development update is endorsed by PPC, a recommendation will be presented
to the Board for approval on June 14, 2019. Mr. Lane asked the Subcommittee for input.
Engineer Conrad stated that rural projects might not do well with the type of scoring used
by NOACA. He asked for clarification of urbanized versus rural with respect to scoring.
Ms. Gallucci stated that rural projects would not score well when compared to urban
projects based on the criteria, so NOACA set aside money for the rural area and have
rural projects compete against each other for funding. She noted that NOACA could
include additional criteria just for rural areas. Engineer Conrad asked if NOACA will
provide a specific dollar amount for rural projects. Ms. Gallucci said NOACA has provided
rural areas in the past with 15% of its urbanized area funds based on vehicle miles traveled
(VMT).

1-4

 Mr. Romancak asked if intermodal refers to freight, people or both. Ms. Gallucci said
intermodal refers to freight and people. Mr. Daugherty stated that NOACA looked at
Hopkins International Airport and the connectors to the major modes.
Mr. Capelle asked how transit and rail car requests fit in with the criteria for roadways.
Ms. Gallucci stated that rail cars tend to score high and receive more points for mobility
and access. Mr. Lane mentioned that other modes are looked at through Transportation
Alternatives (TA) to connect to regionwide assets and for regional travel.
Mr. Capelle asked if an application for a bus would be treated the same way as an
application for a rail car. Ms. Gallucci said yes, and noted that buses were previously
primarily funded through the CMAQ program; however, due to significant cuts made to
that program by ODOT, funding will may not be available for buses and bicycle
facilities. She said there are no restrictions to using STBG funds for buses, rail cars, or
port facilities.
Mr. Capelle said he would ask for more money wherever he can get it, but was not in favor
of degrading the STBG program by adding buses to the mix.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA wants to make sure there is funding for regional
transportation needs. She mentioned that some of the engineers on the Board do not
support NOACA using its funding for buses. Mr. Capelle suggested that staff take a look
at how funding buses would impact certain pots of money.
Ms. Gallucci stated that rail cars should be discussed for the current TIP round and wait
to see how the CMAQ and gas tax issues roll out. She noted that funding made available
through the state gas tax might be available to help the counties.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that Governor Mike DeWine’s gas tax increase proposal would
generate a substantial amount of money for counties, cities and townships. She noted
that the State House approved $100 million for public transit, and if that amount stays in
the transportation budget, flex funds could be used for buses.
Ms. Nicole English asked how the schedules align. Ms. Gallucci stated that buses are not
in the mix, but STBG funding has been requested for rail cars.
Mr. Cross stated that TA is primarily related to bikes, which are typically used for local
short trips that are not regional in nature. He asked how TA fits in with the definition of
regional connectivity.
Ms. Gallucci stated that TA funds are designated for specific kinds of projects, such as
bikes, and are rated separately from the rest of the projects. She noted that rural roadways
or minor collectors are built into part of a significant regional transportation system. She
provided examples of regional connectivity of roadways and bicycle network.
Mr. Lane mentioned that $8.4 million in TAP funds has been included in NOACA’s TIP
cycle that cannot be spent on roads and bridges.
Mr. Switalski asked if NOACA’s budget commitments include State Infrastructure Bank
(SIB) loans / debt service. Mr. Lane said NOACA’s commitments include the following:
8168c

1-5

 SIB loans and other projects in FY 2021; SIB loans in FY 2022-2024 for STBG funds and
$1.5 million for the Opportunity Corridor; and the set aside for the TLCI program.
Mr. Switalski asked if NOACA has a cap for its debt service. Ms. Gallucci said yes.
Mr. Lane said the cap is no more than 50% of NOACA’s total allocation for any one
program and noted that the peak debt service for SIB loan commitments is $11.4 million
in FY 2024. Mr. Lane mentioned that some of NOACA’s debt falls off in FY 2025.
Mr. Switalski asked if NOACA uses criteria or parameters to determine points for regional
connectivity; and if so, can that information be shared with the Subcommittee.
Mr. Lane stated that the intent of scoring is to elevate projects that have regional
significance. Ms. Gallucci noted that scoring helps to eliminate as much subjectivity as
possible and provides an objective, data driven decision-making approach that has been
pushed by the Board for a number of years.
Engineer Jim Gills asked if staff is focusing on specific projects on the TIP. Ms. Gallucci
said no, not yet. She noted that staff is currently focusing on the universe of projects and
tightening up the criteria.
Ms. Feke inquired about the weight factors for job centers. Mr. Daugherty presented a list
of weight factors for different categories, including job centers. Mr. Lane mentioned that
the University Circle and Downtown Cleveland job hubs are a Level 3; four other job hubs
are a Level 2; and local hotspots and central business districts are a Level 1.
Mr. Klaiber asked why staff did not consider road condition. Mr. Lane stated that road
condition is already a basis for the plan needs that were identified, and noted that certain
conditions are built into the project list or eligibility list.
Ms. English asked if staff compared the initial priority list to the revised priority list that
includes additional projects. Ms. Gallucci said yes. Ms. English asked if the additional
projects are distinguished on the list. Mr. Lane said no, but noted that staff is in the
process of applying filters to the list.
Ms. Gallucci said it was important for staff to identify projects not in the plan so people
have a better understanding of why certain projects did not make it on the list. She noted
that staff had follow-up discussions with sponsors / applicants to ensure NOACA has a
comprehensive and fair priority list. Mr. Lane stated that about 75-80% of the projects
submitted to NOACA were added to the list.
Mr. Switalski asked if staff has the revised priority list. Ms. Gallucci said once the list has
been completed, it will be made available to the Subcommittee. Ms. Gallucci talked about
how NOACA improved the TIP development process.

NOACA Transportation Subcommittee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

June 14, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Reviews – 1st Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Subcommittee is asked to consider recommending the 1st Quarter Project Planning Reviews (PPRs) to
the Planning and Programming Committee at its July 2019 meeting.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed projects to be presented to the NOACA Planning
and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils: intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Attachments: Project Summary

Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
History/Background: These projects are included in ODOT District 12’s Program.
Title: Reconstruction of SR-43 in Solon
Sponsor: City of Solon
Estimated Total Cost: $8,107,165
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program
provides funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective
activity designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program
is funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
Proposed Project: The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement
Program (HSIP) funding:
•

CUY SR-43 - 1.98: PID No. 109517 - This project involves reconstruction and widening
of SR-43 (Aurora Road), from 2 lanes to 3 lanes, from the Solar Shopping Center, 0.13
mile east of SR-91 (SOM Center Road) to Liberty Road, in Solon (schematic). The
scope will also include a new water line, storm sewer, a permanent traffic signal at Portz
Parkway, a multipurpose path on the south side of Aurora Road and an on-street bike
lane on the north side with new sidewalks. Right turn lanes will be installed at Clearwater
Court, Portz Parkway and Liberty Road.
The project’s estimated total cost is $8,107,605. The estimated cost of preliminary
engineering preliminary development (PEPD) is $64,974. The estimated cost of
preliminary engineering detailed design (PEDD) is $11,466. The PEPD and PEDD will
be funded by ODOT. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $450,000. The RW will
be funded with local funds ($450,000). The estimated cost of construction (CO) is
$7,091,165. The CO will be funded with HSIP funds ($1,500,000) and local funds
($5,591,165). The estimated cost of construction engineering (CE) is $490,000. The CE
will be locally funded.

Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o Level 2 of NOACA Freight Network, meaning relatively high truck counts. Design should
consider their turning movements mainly at the shopping center.
o Include high-visibility crosswalks and pedestrian countdown heads with the new signal at
Portz Parkway.
o Include pedestrian crossing for Aurora Road.
Committee Review:
Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory Council (BPAC)
RECOMMENDATIONS:
o Consider providing less width to the vehicular lanes and more width to the bike lane
and/or create a buffer between the bike lane. However, the Safety and Operations
Council cautioned not to reduce the eastbound travel lane as some cyclists may still
choose to use the road rather than the side path.
5-3

 o
o

Consider a shared use path on both sides of the road in lieu of the bike lane (allocate the
5 feet to creating a path,10 feet wide, rather than a path, 5 feet wide and a bike lane, 5
feet wide).
BPAC strongly recommends signing and or centerline striping on the new multi-use path.
Since the existing sidewalk on the south side is being widened to serve as a multi-use
path, BPAC recommends measures that will identify that the facility has changed and
cyclists are permitted on the path.

COMPLETE AND GREEN STREETS POLICY
POLICY:

All projects requesting inclusion to the LRTP and/or TIP will be reviewed against this policy for
opportunities to expand complete and green streets in the NOACA region. All projects requesting
NOACA administered funds shall be required to adhere to this policy and are therefore eligible for
NOACA funding participation to implement complete and green street recommendations. The
complete and green streets policy aims to create a measurably better transportation system that
is more equitable, balanced, and effective and which offers every user of the public right-of-way
safe, connected, and sustainable transportation options. This effort to make the system more
complete and green will take advantage of opportunities presented by necessary reconstruction
and expansion of the system whenever practicable.
The goals of this Complete and Green Streets Policy are:
• Create a comprehensive, integrated, and connected transportation network that supports
sustainable development and provides livable communities.
• Ensure safety, ease of use, and ease of transfer between modes for all users of the
transportation system.
• Restore the natural hydrologic function of the region’s watersheds.
• Provide flexibility for different types of streets, areas, and users.

POLICY STATEMENT:

NOACA has long been a proponent of creating a multimodal, safe, and efficient transportation
system that ensures accessibility to all roadway users. Recognizing the road network is the
largest public space in the region, and the demand for transportation choices and improved
water quality continues to grow, NOACA has established a Complete and Green Streets Policy.
This Complete and Green Streets policy promotes a multimodal transportation system that is
integrated with sustainable green infrastructure. The main objective is to ensure roadways are
designed and built to safely and comfortably accommodate all users of roadways, including
motorists, cyclists, pedestrians, disabled individuals, transit and school bus riders, Amish
buggies, freight haulers, and emergency responders. All users includes people of all ages and
abilities.
This policy establishes the link between the agency’s strategic objectives with its investment
decisions.

1
6-3

 PURPOSE:

The desired outcome of the Complete and Green Streets Policy is to create an equitable,
balanced and sustainable transportation system where every roadway user can travel safely and
comfortably.
NOACA’s vision is to STRENGTHEN regional cohesion, PRESERVE existing infrastructure, and
BUILD a sustainable multi-modal transportation system to SUPPORT economic development and
ENHANCE quality of life in Northeast Ohio. In furtherance of the vision of NOACA, five goals
guide the agency. This policy supports all five goals.

BACKGROUND:

Complete Streets are roadways designed to safely and comfortably accommodate all users,
including, but not limited to motorists, cyclists, pedestrians, disabled individuals, transit and school
bus riders, Amish buggies, freight haulers, and emergency responders. All users includes people
of all ages and abilities.
Green Streets reflect the transportation policy and design approach that minimizes environmental
impact by focusing on efforts to retain, treat and eliminate runoff at the source using green
infrastructure applications. Green infrastructure helps replicate natural hydrologic functions like
storage, detention, infiltration, filtration, evaporation, transpiration, and uptake by plants, and can
improve water quality and reduce runoff volumes. These natural functions are often lost in
transportation projects where impervious road surfaces prevent rain water from soaking into the
ground. Green streets incorporate infiltration, biofiltration, and/or storage and use BMPs to collect,
retain, or detain stormwater runoff while also providing design elements that creates attractive
streetscapes. Green Streets can foster unique and attractive streetscapes that protect and
enhance neighborhood livability and integrate, rather than separate, the built and natural
environments.
Complete and Green Streets create a measurably better transportation system that is more
equitable, balanced, and effective and which offers every user of the public right-of-way safe,
connected, and sustainable transportation options.

REQUIREMENTS:
The design and development of the transportation facility should improve conditions for all users
by:
• Designs shall consider accommodations for all users and be sensitive to the context
of the project setting. Complete and green streets are not a one size fits all; every
project may look different.
• Designing context-appropriate facilities in accordance with available standards and
guidance that best ensures safety and efficient operation for all users. The design of
facilities for bicyclists, pedestrians and transit facilities should follow recognized design
guidelines and standards, such as the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities,
AASHTO’s Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Context Solutions Guide, Americans with Disabilities
Act Accessibility Guidelines, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Separated Bike

Design Guides and other recognized and acceptable design publications.
Safety shall be prioritized equally for all modes. Safety improvements for any one
mode will not be minimized to achieve improved level of service for any one mode.
Projects should be coordinated with adjacent jurisdictions to ensure consistency of
facilities
Every project shall include the transit agency (if applicable) in the project development
process to ensure that sufficient accommodation of transit vehicles and access to
transit facilities is provided
Sponsors must demonstrate how the project advances multimodal connectivity and
access to adjacent land uses and destinations within the corridor.
The project sponsor must anticipate likely future demand for all modes and not
preclude the provision of future improvements.
The project sponsor should consider short, medium and long range complete and
green designs.
Design criteria shall be based on the thoughtful application of engineering,
architectural and urban design principles such that all projects shall make the Region
a more appealing, enjoyable, and sustainable place in which to live and work.
Foster communication and coordination to encourage consideration of watershed
health and improved water quality through use of green infrastructure applications
Coordinate programs and projects to implement Green Streets as an integrated aspect
of road right-of-way infrastructure, and where feasible, maintenance-level or
rehabilitation projects
Consider implementing programs and projects in a systematic manner to maximize
water quality benefits through a prioritized infrastructure plan within the Metropolitan
Planning Area
Strive to develop new and innovative means to cost-effectively construct and maintain
new green street facilities
Consider the following during project scoping: vegetated swales, rain gardens,
retention areas, constructed wetlands, permeable pavers, tree wells and planters, revegetation/rehabilitation efforts and other best management practices. Resources to
consult include: EPA’s Managing Wet Weather with Green Infrastructure Municipal
Handbook, NOACA’s Clean Water 208 Water Quality Management Plan for Northeast
Ohio and local green streets policies.
If vegetation is included in project design, priority should be given to native and siteadaptive species.

Exceptions:

Sponsors are required to consider bicycles, pedestrians and transit access improvements in the
planning and design of their proposed project as well as green infrastructure. In particular,
incorporate infiltration, biofiltration, and/or storage to collect, retain, or detain stormwater runoff
as well as sidewalks, bike facilities, street crossings (including over- and under-crossings),
pedestrian signals, signs, street furniture, transit stops and facilities, and all connecting pathways
should be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so that all modes and pedestrians,
including people with disabilities, can travel safely and independently. The project may not
warrant consideration if one or more of the following conditions are met:
• The project is limited exclusively to resurfacing or other maintenance type activities.
In these cases pavement striping for bike lanes, cross walks, signage or other lowcost bicycle and pedestrian countermeasures must still be recommended.

6-5

 •
•

•
•

Bicyclists and pedestrians are prohibited by law from using the transportation corridor.
In this instance, a greater effort may be necessary to accommodate bicyclists and
pedestrians as an alternate to the transportation corridor.
The cost of establishing bikeways or walkways that meet applicable standards would
exceed 20% of the cost of the larger transportation project. This percentage is not a
target for expenditure; it is a benchmark for assessing when provision of bicycle or
pedestrian facilities is too costly for consideration.
There are extreme topographic or natural resource constraints.
The project is located on a low-volume roadway (ADT is less than 1000) that is not
projected to carry significant bicycle or pedestrian usage, or that does not carry or
provide access to fixed route transit service.

Implementation:

Upon approval and adoption of this Complete Streets Policy, it will become part of NOACA’s
planning process and the scoring process for NOACA-attributable funding project selection. The
principles of this policy will also guide NOACA staff in the preparation of the Long Range
Transportation Plan and other plans it prepares or to which it contributes. Policy guidance and
resources will be posted on the NOACA website to assist project sponsors in developing
Complete and Green Streets projects. This guidance will contain model policies, sample design
standards, and information on other resources.

NOACA Air Quality Subcommittee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

June 14, 2019

RE:

Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program

ACTION REQUESTED
No action requested. This item is included for information and presentation only. This item will be
considered by the Planning and Programming Committee at its July 2019 meeting.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
In November 2012, ODOT directed the Ohio Association of Regional Councils (OARC) and its
eight large Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) members to develop a statewide CMAQ
Program. The intent of the statewide program, as directed by ODOT, is to reduce the amount of
unspent funds and advance projects of statewide significance. Up until the formation of the
statewide program, CMAQ funding was historically suballocated to the individual MPO programs
by ODOT using a formula based on population within the air quality non-attainment areas.
The statewide CMAQ program has replaced the individual programs historically administered by
the eight largest MPOs. These MPOs represent the greater regions of Akron, Canton,
Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo, and Youngstown. NOACA expects to receive
approximately $25 million for projects for implementation in SFYs 2024-2025.
NOACA staff has initiated evaluation and scoring of each CMAQ application in accordance with
the new statewide program policy project scoring criteria. The criterion includes:
1. Project Type (10 points)
2. Cost Effectiveness (15 points)
3. Other Benefits (15 points)
4. Existing Level of Service (15 points)
5. Positive Impact on Level of Service (15 points)
6. Status of Project (10 points)
7. Non-Federal Match Commitments (10 points)
8. Regional Priority (10, 7, 4, 2 points based on top four project priorities)
9. History of Project Delivery (up to -10 points)

5-7

1

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
Projects selected for the region will establish the initial CMAQ budgets for SFYs 2024-2025.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA staff will finalize project evaluation and scoring and present the projects, along with
input from the subcommittee, to the Planning and Programming Committee for recommendation
at its July 12 meeting.
Staff will submit recommended applications to the Statewide CMAQ Program Committee for
evaluation against other statewide projects in October 2019. The Statewide CMAQ Program
Committee will then submit project recommendations to the OARC Executive Directors for final
approval at their November 2019 meeting.

RE:

FY 2021-2024 TIP Development Update – Potential Projects for NOACA
Controlled Funds

ACTION REQUESTED
This item is for information to update the subcommittee on progress toward the selection of
projects to be funded with NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG)
funds and STBG set-asides for Transportation Alternative Projects (TAP) for the SFY 20212024 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). The subcommittee will also be requested to
provide input to determine the final universe of projects to be evaluated for NOACA funding
consideration.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
NOACA is developing its Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for State Fiscal Years
(SFY) 2021-2024, which will be in effect from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2024. The TIP will
contain road, bridge, public transit, and other transportation projects scheduled for
implementation within NOACA’s five counties. The TIP will include projects supported by
NOACA administered funds and by other federal funds controlled through ODOT, the Federal
Transit Administration (FTA), or by other governmental agencies.
As previously presented, there are approximately 700 identified projects totaling more than $1
billion needed for implementation through the next 2021-2024 TIP timeframe. However, NOACA
only has an estimated $90 million of available funding. As such, it is extremely important that
projects advanced with NOACA funding in the SFY 2021 - 2024 TIP best represent priorities
contained in the AIM Forward 2040 long-range transportation plan while also aligning with
established State and Federal transportation performance management initiatives.
At the March 2019 Transportation Subcommittee staff presented a methodology to filter and
evaluate projects for NOACA funding. The methodology prioritizes projects that best provide
regional benefit and connectivity, as well as address local needs, which are measured against
criteria that aligns with the goals of the NOACA Going Forward, Together regional strategic plan. In
addition, the projects are evaluated against plan priorities as contained in the NOACA AIM
Forward 2040 long-range transportation plan. The input received from the Transportation
Subcommittee was reflected in staff presentation to the Planning and Committee.
At the April, 2019 Planning and Programming Committee meeting staff presented the methodology
and received additional input on the recommended approach for evaluation. The final
methodology evaluated and subsequently recommended by the Transportation Subcommittee and
Planning and Programming Committee is attached to this memo.

6 - 11

 The recommended approach involved filtering the top 25% of all preservation projects, both
NOACA Transportation Asset Management (TAM) plan and sponsor requested projects, by cost
effectiveness, which equates to approximately 170 projects. The 170 projects were then distributed
by each county’s percent share of the region’s vehicle miles travelled (VMT). Each county’s
projects have been evaluated by staff against the recommended regional significance and planning
criteria. Projects will also be evaluated considering geographic equity and whether they are located
in an Environmental Justice, Urban Core, or Disadvantaged Community.
The draft list of projects proposed for further evaluation of NOACA funding consideration by work
type, including preservation; safety and congestion; and transportation alternatives, is contained
here. The list delineates the top 25% of preservation projects that are proposed for further
evaluation and funding consideration as well as the bottom 75% that are not. The subcommittee is
asked to assess the projects and provide input to determine if any projects not proposed for further
evaluation warrant additional consideration based on regional importance and connectivity.
Considering subcommittee input, staff will finalize the list of projects and complete evaluation
against regional significance criteria. Project funding recommendations will be presented to the
Planning and Programming Committee at its July 12, 2019 meeting for recommendation and to the
Board of Directors at its September 13, 2019 meeting for approval.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Upon Board approval, staff will work with project sponsors to finalize project scope, schedule
and budget for incorporation into the draft 2021-2024 TIP, along with non-NOACA funded
projects. The final draft TIP will be presented to the Planning and Programming Committee for
recommendation at its January 17, 2020 meeting and to the Board of Directors at its March 6,
2020 meeting.

RE:

Transportation Review Advisory Council (TRAC) Project Applications

ACTION REQUESTED
This item is for information and input from the Subcommittee.
BACKGROUND
The TRAC has the responsibility for selecting Major New transportation projects for the Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT). The TRAC announced the solicitation of projects for its 2019
round in May 2019. Five applications from the NOACA region totaling more than $200 million, and
twenty seven applications from the entire state were submitted to the TRAC for projects totaling more
than $900 million in new funding requests. Projects eligible for submittal were projects that have a total
cost greater than $12 million, add transportation capacity or reduce congestion, and are critical to the
mobility, economic development, and quality of life of the citizens of Ohio. All but two of the seven
projects have been presented to NOACA committees and to the Board of Directors during prior funding
rounds.
The TRAC has scheduled the public hearing for Northeast Ohio on August 6, 2019. ODOT has
requested project priorities be submitted to the TRAC Program Manager before July 18, 2019.
