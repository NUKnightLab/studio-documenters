Re: Settlement Memorandum ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

PRMLEGED CONFIDENTIAL.
MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS: 

PERSONAL INJURY 
MEDIATION: This lawsuit was ?led in Federal Court, and as such, was not mediated.

LIABILITYIEVALUATION: Under Michigan and Federal law, dogs are considered personal
property. The 4th Amendment protects all citizens against unreasonable seizures of personal
property. When an officer shoots a dog, he/she is seizing the dog with a bullet. In December of
2016, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals which governs federal law in Michigan analyzed the
shooting of dogs under the 4th Amendment. In Brown v. i132 ofBattlecreek, the court set forth the
following standard: a police officer?s use of deadly force against a dog is reasonable under the
Fourth Amendment when, given the totality of the circumstances and viewed from the perSpective
of an objectively reasonable officer, the dog poses an imminent threat to the of?cer?s safety.

Plaintiffs assert claims against the defendant of?cers for illegal seizure of the dogs in
violation of the 4th Amendment under 42 U.S.C. ?l983, three alternate Monell claims against the
City of Detroit, and claims for conversion and intentional in?iction of emotional distress under

state law.

The state law claims for intentional in?iction of emotional distress and conversion are
subject to dismissal and in any event, of minimal value. Under Michigan law, one can only recover
the fair market value of the dog. These two dogs have a fair market value of less than $500.00. In
addition, the claims against the City are subject to dismissal because we do not have a policy of
unreasonably shooting dogs. In fact, our written policy only allows an officer to shoot a dog when
it poses and imminent threat and there are no reasonable alternatives to the use of deadly force.

As for liability for illegal seizure of the dogs by and through shooting them, Of?cer Wright
has qualified immunity because she shot the dogs because they posed an imminent threat to her
safety. However, officer Mortier is responsible for the death of the two dogs due to his violation
of Ms. Thomas? 4th Amendment rights. Entry of a home without a warrant is presumptively
unreasonable under the 4th Amendment except under limited circumstances which clearly did not
exist here. Of?cer Mortier had no right to yank open the security door to Ms. Thomas? home when
she had told him that he could not enter or search her home. Accordingly, he is directly responsible
for the dogs escaping and being shot.

This writer sat down with of?cer Mortier, and viewed the video and audio of the subject
event. The whole area of 4th Amendment search and seizure with respect to homes can become
very complicated, even for persons with law degrees who specialize in the area. Officer Mortier
was of the belief that he could open the security door without entering Ms. Thomas? home for the
purposes of the 4th Amendment. While under certain circumstances this is true, those

Thomas vs Detroit, et. el. PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

Date: October 23, 2019
Page 3

circumstances did not exist here. This writer explained to Of?cer Mortier that unless he has
exigent circumstances or is in hot pursuit of a felon into the home, it is virtually certain that he will
need a warrant to open the front door to a home.

It should be noted that the issue of whether to afford of?cer Mortier defense and
indemni?cation has not been fully addressed by the Police Department, Law Department, or this
Honorable Body. However, it is our opinion that merely being mistaken about a very tricky aspect
of the law does not take of?cer Mortier?s conduct out of the realm of good faith performance of
his duties.

From a damages perspective, of?cer Mortier?s wrongful conduct resulted in the shooting
deaths of Ms. Thomas? two dogs. Given Ms. Thomas voiced concern for the safety of here dogs
numerous times and was assured by of?cer Mortier that the dogs would be ?ne, a typical jury is
going to take a very dim View of of?cer Mortier?s conduct. Pets (especially dogs) are considered
by most as members of the family. While under Michigan state law plaintiffs would only be entitle
to the fair market value of the dogs at the time we killed them, under the federal civil rights act
plaintiffs are entitle to emotional damages together with attorney fees, costs and punitive damages.

By way of illustration, we have found jury verdicts and settlements from across the country
that range from a $1,250,000.00 jury verdict in San Jose for the shooting of three dogs,
$620,000.00 jury verdict in Maryland for shooting one dog and a verdict of $330,000.00 in
Chicago for the shooting death of one dog. In addition, we found an $800,000.00 settlement for
the death of a dog in Costa Mesa, California, a $225,000.00 settlement for the shooting death of a
dog in Minnesota and a 101,000.00 judgment for the shooting death of a do in Des Moines, Iowa.
In a word, people from all over the United States take the wrongful killing of their dogs as
extremely serious, and second only to the wrongful death of a human being.

It is this writer?s Opinion that the conservative range for compensatory damages for the two
dogs under the facts in this case is $75,000.00 to $150,000.00 a dog for a typical jury. However,
it does not end there. If the jury ?nds that of?cer Mortier?s conduct was reckless and resulted in
the execution of plaintiffs pets, it is more probable than not that a typical jury is going to award
punitive damages. While a jury is free to award as much as 4 to 5 times its compensatory award,
it is likely they will simply double the compensatory award. There also will be an award of
$40,000.00 to $60,000.00 in attorney fees and then, several thousand will be awarded in pre and
post judgment interest

In sum, the video and audio clearly shows the case is simply not defensible. In light of the
fact that this case is a very dangerous one to take to a jury on the damage issue, and could end up
pushing $300,000.00 to $400,000.00, we spent a considerable amount of effort and time at the
outset of this litigation trying to reach a settlement with plaintiffs. After extensive negotiations,
we were able to get plaintiff to agree to take a total of $50,000.00 in full settlement of all her
claims. The Law Department highly recommends this settlement because it is in the City?s best

CASE NO. 19-12708
FILE NO. L19-00657 

 

NAME: Teresa Thomas
DATE OF INCIDENT: July 19, 2019 TIME: 1:12 pm.

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: The instant case arises out of the shooting of plaintiff, Teresa
Thomas? two pet pit bull dogs.

On July 19, 2019, defendant of?cers responded as back-up to a shots ?red run at 2425
Beals, Detroit, MI. Upon arrival at the scene, a woman complained of having an altercation with
a man who took out a semiautomatic pistol and ?red several shots into the air. The female
complainant advised that the man retreated into the home at 2425 Beals. Of?cer Mortier spoke to
Ms. Teresa Thomas at 2425 Beals, and explained that the shooter had retreated into her home and
he needed to enter and search for him.

The complete interaction, high de?nition video and audio, was captured on of?cer
Mortier?s body camera. Ms. Thomas was behind a closed security grate, and had three pet pit bulls
who were plainly visible. She told of?cer Mortier that no such man entered her home, and she
was concerned about the safety of her dogs if she allowed a search. Her son came out of the home
onto the front porch, and accompanied of?cer Mortier down to the complainant?s home. The
Complainant con?rmed that the shooter was not Ms. Thomas? son.

Of?cer Mortier returned to Ms. Thomas? front porch, and again requested that she allow a
search of her home. Ms. Thomas again refused, and continued to voice concern for the safety of
her pet dogs. Without warning, of?cer Mortier grabbed the security grate and yanked it open.
This pulled Ms. Thomas across the front door threshold and brie?y onto the front porch. Ms.
Thomas attempted to grab her pet dogs, but they escaped out the front door. The dogs attacked
police of?cer Wright who was standing along the side of the home. Of?cer Wright had no choice
but to shoot the two attacking dogs.

As a result of the shots ?red, one of the dogs expired, and the other died an hour or so later
at an animal hospital.
