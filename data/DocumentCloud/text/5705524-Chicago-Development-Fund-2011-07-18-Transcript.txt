URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.

would, please. Can you bring us all back
up?to?speed?

MR. SMITH: Sure. Thanks to the new Board
members joining CDF. I do have some content in
this presentation that's sort of a refresher,
slash, reintro on New Markets and how they work.
Before diving in, though, I did want to confirm
whether we had enough time to do that piece of the
presentation as well as the items of which there?s
actual votes just to make sure 

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: We should be done within
the hour altogether.

MR. SMITH: So the New Markets Program is
still relatively new. Legislatively it's existed
since 2000. It was created at the end of the
Clinton Administration. Functionally the
allocations began in 2002 and the deals really
began to close around 2004.

Its administered by the U.S.
Treasury, the CDFI Fund division. It's essentially
intended to be a core layer or a counterpart to the
low?income housing tax credit. You can't finance
rental housing with New Markets, but you can do

just about everything else. It is geared toward

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 



10: 06AM



10: 07AM

low-income communities. So it's sort of a
commercial/industrial community facility
counterpart. It can support loans or equity
investments to operating businesses as well as
development projects.

The net effect, just based on how
the economics of the credit work, is that it can
generate a layer of capital of 15 to 25 percent of
the total project over and above what the project
can normally support through traditional
underwriting.

The program runs through an entity
known as the CDE. So this is a type of entity that
is certified by the U.S. Treasury. There's some
flexibility about what domestic corporation or partnership that can be
controlled by for?profits, nonprofits, or
government entities. It has to be mission driven
with the primary mission as serving low?income
communities. It has to be accountable to
low-income communities. Stacie is here
representing CDF's advisory board, which is a
seven?member board. The bulk of the members of

that board either live in or in the daily line of

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

10: 07AM

10: 07AM

10 08M

10: 08AM

work serve low?income people and that's how the 
maintains its accountability to low?income
communities.

CDE is applied to treasury to get to
certified as a CDE, so the Chicago Development Fund
did that back in 2005. And then once you're 
certified as a CDE you can actually make a
competitive application for the tax credits.

CDEs are very diverse as far as
where they focus both in terms of project types
that they pursue or business types as well as their
geographic service area. So Chicago Development
Funds legally the service area is Cook County
from the policy perspective, of course, the city of
Chicago; but there are regional CDEs, national
CDEs, and everything in between.

Areas of eligibility: With very
limited exceptions you can only finance New Markets
investments, businesses or projects in qualifying
census tracts. So that's based on income and
poverty as of the 2000 census currently. So if the
tract was 80 percent or less of the area median
income and/or have a poverty rate of 20 percent or

greater, it's New Markets eligible.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781*9586

 



10 08AM

10: 09AM



The census update has not yet
reached the point of detail where the census tracts
will change. That's expected sometime next year.

And then there's this other overlay
on top of basic eligibility for greater economic
distress, so there's a number of different factors
there based on higher rates of poverty, lower rates
of income, unemployment, being in a TIF or a
conference zone, being a brown field, medically
underserved areas. There's a number of different
overlays that qualify tracts as being distressed.
The CDF, like most of the other CDEs in the
business, has committed to do its deals only in
distressed area tracts. So the dark green areas
that we see there on the map are both qualifying
and distressed.

The size of the program, initially
when it was created there was $15 billion set aside
by Congress in terms of tax credit allocations, and
then that got supplemented by a billion dollars
after the Katrina disaster through a special gulf
opportunity zone overlay. And then in 2008 and
2009 the Stimulus Act added a total of 3 billion to

that initial 15 billion~dollar pot and there were

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 





10 10AM

one?year extensions of the program at a 3.5
billion?dollar level in addition to that.

In 2010, at the end of the year the
tax bill that Congress passed at the eleventh hour
did include a two?year extension of the New Markets
Program. It was originally going to be 5 billion a
year which matched the stimulus a year allocation,
but at the last minute it was cut back to 3.5 as
part of the negotiations on the tax bill.

So the 2010 round was actually
allocated in February 2011 due to the delays of
that tax bill, and then the 2011 round application
is due on July 27th, so next Wednesday. And then
the CDFI Fund will probably make their
determinations and allocations late this year,
probably November.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: So just to be clear, one oi
the items we will consider on the agenda today is
the filing of our next proposal for an allocation.

MR. SMITH: And then there are proposals on
the table for a 5 billion?dollar extension. The
program at various points in the budget discussions
extend as much a five-year extension which many in

the CDFI and CDE community think would be a good

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

lO 

10: 11AM



10 11AM

thing for the New Markets industry because there
are lots of banks sitting on the sidelines thinking
about investing in the infrastructure developed in
the New Markets Program, but with these one?year
extensions they?re not. It certainly makes sense.

So the capital flow in the New
Markets Program, the CDE is intended to be a
financial intermediary. So it takes in an equity
investment from an investor and then in turn
deploys substantially all of the proceeds of that
equity investment into qualifying low?income and
community businesses through loans or equity
investments.

The investor in return for making
their equity investment gets a seven?year tax
credit equal to 39 percent of the amount they
invested. So the bulk of the investors in the
program are large banks that are operating within a
CRA footprint. They do investment credit for
funding New Markets transactions. There are some
other investors in the program on a much more
limited scale.

How the deals actually get done, the

investors tend to be purely tax motivated. They

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

10 

10: 12AM

10: 12AM

10: 12AM

?10

 

 

tend to want to put in, roughly, 25 cents up front
to get 39 cents of Federal tax credit over seven
years so they're earning a return on investment
purely from tax relief.

So in order to make the full dollar
investment that you need to make in order to get
that 39 cents of tax relief, they need to borrow
the rest of the funds.

So this concept of leverage loans is
something that the industry developed back around
2004 after the IRS ruled that that was acceptable
in order to bifurcate the deal into a tax credit
equity component and a sort of economic or debt
component.

So you see on the top left the
leverage lender typically loans about 75 percent of
the capital to the investor. The investor funds
the other 25 percent through tax credit equity.
The investor gets all the tax credits and then the
debt service to the leverage lender flows up
through the structure and goes to them.

So that 25 cents in tax credit
equity is really the subsidy that's being

generated. The leverage sources are really what

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
{312) 781-9586

 

10: 12AM





'11

 

 

the project can support on its own without New
Markets. So thatpercent
subsidy.

It's a very competitive program.
Each year it gets more competitive in terms of who
gets allocation and how much, and a lot of that
ties to the programatic intent of New Markets being
to provide jobs, goods, services, or other benefits
to lOWuincome communities and populations. There?s
a lot of reporting required as part of the program.
CDEs need to tell Treasury what?s happened from
their previous investments and what they anticipate
their future investments are going to accomplish in
that regard, and a lot of the scoring of the
application ties to community impact.

So, generally speaking, Treasury
favors owner?occupied and operating business
projects as opposed to speculative real estate; job
creating projects particularly if they're high
quality living wage?type jobs with benefits,
healthy foods projects, whether they be grocery
stores or farmers markets or food processing or
distribution or other things that support access to

produce in particular within underserved areas;

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 





10 14AM



service providers where there's job training,
education, health care, particularly with a
low-income community focus on the service
clientele; green projects, LEAD?certified, brown
field cleanups, that sort of thing; and then
financing that actually results in something
tangible getting created on the ground whether it's
a new building or a rehab or a substantial
equipment purchase or some business expansion.

There are other things that you can
legally do with New Markets that are less favored
with respect to real estate projects in areas that
clearly aren't going to qualify shortly with tax
credits to rapidly gentrifying depreciating areas,
projects that happen to be located in a qualifying
census tract that serve a high?income clientele,
refinancing for sale leasebacks. So those things
you do see out there in the industry, CDF avoids
those, but they're legally possible.

In terms of comparing CDF to other
municipal CDEs, which is just a small slice of the
industry, CDF is the third largest municipal
allocatee of the program. CDF got in much later

than the other major municipal allocatees that

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

l0 IBM

10: 15AM

10 15AM

applied first in the 2006_round. St. Louis and
Phoenix, two of the other two larger allocatees got
in 2002 and 2003, respectfully. And Phoenix got a
170 million?dollar allocation in that first round
back when things were a little more wide open.
Other large cities over a million in

population, four of them New York, Houston, and
San Antonio, and San Diego have not obtained
allocations to date, but they?re city controlled.
They have seen New Markets deals in their geography
certainly. Los Angelos has had one allocation of
75 million to date; Philadelphia, one allocation of
60; and Dallas, one allocation of 55. And that?s a
refresher on New Markets.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Questions?

MR. TUNNEY: Chicago was No. 3, but what was
the value?

MR. SMITH: Chicago has gotten 173 million in
allocations today.

MS. NEELY: Do you know how much we put out?

MR. SMITH: 131 deployed so far.

MS. NEELY: 173 and 131?

MR. SMITH: Uh?huh.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: We'll go over those

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

10: 16AM



10 

10: 16AM

transactions in a second; but before we do, any
other questions? No? Okay.

MR. SMITH: So here's a summary of the deals
that have occurred so far through CDF's financing.
11 transactions in all and you see a breakdown
here as far as the first deal happening in 2008 for
a charter school in Lawndale all the way through a
charter school in Little Village that closed in
April of this year, Instituto Health Sciences
Career Academy.

So in 2008 I'm sorry 2009 and
2010 represent CDF's full stabilized years of
activity, and GDP put out an average of about 52
million a year in allocation over those two years
per year. So that's really our best understanding
of sort of what a stabilized CDF program looks like
based on the volume of the deals that are high
impact, ready to go, and actually apply to GDP for
assistance.

MS. NEELY: This doesn't include some of the
projects that we approved that haven't closed?

MR. SMITH: Correct.

MS. NEELY: Is there a list of those in here,

also?

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781*9586

 

10: 17AM



MR. SMITH: I don't have a list here, but 

MS. NEELY: Can you talk about those?

MR. SMITH: Sure, yeah. One of those is
Finkl Steel which is still out there in
circulation. It's just been substantially delayed.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: The new Finkl Steel?

MR. SMITH: Correct, yeah. One was an
approval for two Aldi stores on the south side.
Aldi elected to just proceed with one of the stores
without New Markets, but the other one they took it
off the shelf took it off the list of capital
improvements for the year. We suspect there was a
little bit of suspicion about New Markets Tax
Credits in general which was closer to the time of
the stimulus and they wanted to avoid being
described as getting a Federal bailout or something
like that.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Since they're a
foreign?owned company.

MR. SMITH: German, yeah. Temple Steel was
approved late in 2008 and then decided to not
pursue their major capital expansion due to a
drastic drop?off in sales volume at the end of

2008. A dance theater was approved. The senior

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
{312) 781-9586

 

10 18AM

10: 18AM

10: 18AM



lender who was coming in ahead of CDF on that
transaction canceled its commitment literally about
two weeks from closing.

MS. NEELY: It's around the corner from my
house.

MR. SMITH: And that senior lender
subsequently was taken over by the FDIC.

MS. NEELY: Wasn't that the one in Alderman
Austin's office? I'm having a senior moment.
Salvation Army.

MR. SMITH: Yeah, that was approved and
Closed and it's under construction.

MS. NEELY: IS that on this list?

MR. SMITH: Yeah. I'm sorry. That is the
Ray and Joan Kroc Community Center, aka, Salvation
Army.

MS. NEELY: Oh, okay.

MS. SCOTT: So it looks like on this list

about four out of the 11 are schools.

MR. SMITH: Let's see. Christ the King, Gary
Comer, Homan and Instituto. Yeah, four schools,
three charter, one parochial. Greater West Town is

a job training project, four industrial deals, and

then PCC Community Wellness is a federally

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
{312) 781-9586

 



10 19AM





qualified health clinic.

In terms of the geographic
distribution, GDP has been very successful in
staying away from the higher income areas of
Chicago that are rapidly gentrifying areas and
instead doing transactions out in the neighborhoods
away from the Loop.

There was actually some press a few
months ago about the Blackstone Hotel project which
was not a CDF transaction but it was New Markets,
and they were questioning whether that is an
appropriate use of the tools since it's on Michigan
Avenue.

CDF has just functionally done deals
that don?t even come close to that sort of line of
scrutiny.

MS. SCOTT: So question for you. Any city
CDE can finance a project in Chicago provided
they if we were to overlay where the other
projects have been, where would they be that we
didn?t do but that are in the city of Chicago?

MR. SMITH: Sure. I'm aware of a few.
There's a middle school in Lawndale. There's

Lawndale Christian Health Center is doing a

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

10 20AM



10 20AM

10: 20AM

federally qualified health center in Lawndale.
There is a medical center dialysis clinic on the
far south side of Roseland. There's Blackstone
Hotel. There's the Target at Wilson Yard. There's
probably more.

There's no comprehensive data. It?s
just self?reported, but there are some sources that
we can certainly map out in addition to what CDF
has done, if that's of interest.

MS. SCOTT: And they're going to the other
cityees as opposed to did we reject them and
they went shopping for another vendor or how did it
work?

MR. SMITH: CDF has a very well~articulated
focus on industrial community facilities and
grocery stores, and so that policy focuses on and
sort of self selected a lot of projects out of
that.

MS. SCOTT: Okay. Got it. Thank you.

MR. SMITH: And, actually, a couple of the
deals that GDP has done to date were multiple CDE
transactions. So the Salvation Army, Kroc Center
had actually four CDEs participating since it was a

massive 73.000 million?dollar project. The Christ

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

10: 21AM

10 21AM

10: 21AM

10 22AM

the King School had two CDEs, and the Instituto of
Health Sciences also had two CDEs.

So to date the two schools I
mentioned Christ the King and Instituto were
both done with LISC as the other allocatee. And
the Salvation Army was Chicago Neighborhood
Initiatives which is formerly Park Bank, so the
remnants of that and their CDE, plus Cap Fund which
is a Michigan?based regional CDE, and then I
Consortium America which is a for-profit
Washington, D.C.?based national CDE.

So in terms of status, of the 11
projects that are closed, eight are complete and
open and operating. Under construction the Radio
Flyer deal, the Kroc Community Center, slash,
Salvation Army, and the Instituto.

MS. NEELY: When are those scheduled to be
completed?

MR. SMITH: To be complete? I apologize. I
don't know those dates off the top of my head.

MS. NEELY: That?s fine.

MR. SMITH: I think all of them this year.
Instituto plans to open for this upcoming school

year; and Kroc Community Center, I think is very

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
{312) 781-9586

 

10 22M

10: 22AM

10 23AM



'20

 

 

late this year.

MS. SCOTT: Instituto, is that a stand?alone
charter or is it part of a network?

MR. SMITH: It's operated by the Instituto
Del Progreso Latino, which also runs the Rudy
Lozano Alternative High School, which I think is
not technically a charter. It's like a contract.
So, yeah, seven community facilities, four
industrial projects.

GDP has tried to get a grocery deal.
There are a couple in the pipeline, so we remain
hopeful. The total of 131 million?dollar
allocation closed which based on the economics that
I went through at the beginning of the presentation
translates into about $35 million of net tax credit
equity subsidy that's being provided as that
additional layer of capital to those deals.

Job creation in aggregate, the
projects are anticipated to create or retain about
740 jobs in low?income communities. That's
industrial production jobs, health care jobs,
education teaching jobs, Engineers in the case
of Radio Flyer and others. And then in terms of

services, a very large scale impacts there through

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 





10: 24AM

charter school students, medical clients, Salvation
Army projects like their after~school program, job
training, and a host of services, that's all

estimated to total a about 18,100 individuals per

year.

Just a couple snapshots of these
projects. The PCC Community Wellness is a health
clinic in Austin. It's a 6.5 million?dollar

project. So that's a LEAD Gold facility. It went
for Silver; they got Gold. It says Silver there.

I apologize. It serves 10,000 people per year with
dental, which is a very underserved niche in
low?income communities generally in Chicago. The
WIC office, behavioral health, primary care.
There's a whole range of much needed services in
Austin.

The Salvation Army community center
over a 70 million-dollar investment on the far
south side on a severely blighted brown field site
that the city had previously owned. So 160,000
square feet serving about 2500 people per day.
It's a membership facility, so there's recreation,
there's a pool, there?s athletic facilities. It

also does after?school programing. And they also

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

10 24AM

10 25AM

10 25AM

10 25AM

adult education with day care on site so it
helps, you know, get some job training without
worrying about the kids are going to be taken care
of.

MS. NEELY: Do you want to just update the
existing Board members about the conflict we had
with the Salvation Army and some of the rules that
we had to overcome and how we got through that?

MR. SMITH: Would David or Mitch or Scott
like to help me?

MR. NAREFSKY: Well, just basically, an
assurance that the Salvation Army would comply with
generally applicable City requirements to make it a
facility available to folks from the community who
want to use it, and a little bit of a tension there
with the Salvation Army's sort of faith?based
religious values mission and the sensitivity they
had as to who would be able to come in and use the
facility and would they, in fact, be consistent
with or in conflict with some of the Salvation Army
values.

But with a lot of pulling and
tugging and some real help from Alderman Austin, we

got the Salvation Army to basically agree with the

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 



10 26AM



10: 26AM

City policy.

MS. NEELY: The deal almost died. I mean,
they were really holding firm on their beliefs, and
Alderman Austin, they saw that this was important.

MR. NAREFSKY: They're a very hierarchical
structure. I've dealt with them in other contexts.
They?re a very hierarchal 1

MS. SCOTT: It's an Army.

MR. NAREFSKY: -- structure.

MS. NEELY: Yeah, there was a Colonel there.

MR. NAREFSKY: Yeah. And so it took a while
just to, you know, to get it done.

MS. NEELY: And it was good work on
everyone?s part. I just wanted to make you guys
aware of that.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: It?s relevant, too, because
there may be another Salvation Army projects coming
in in the latter part of the year.

MR. NAREFSKY: It may be a different 

MS. NEELY: Colonel?

MR. SMITH: I think, actually, yes, the prior
Colonel has retired.

MS. NEELY: There you have it. Now I'm sure

there will be a different Colonel.

MS. SMITH: Testa Produce closed late in
2010. This is really a showcase facility, LEED
Platinum. The first freezer/cooler building in the
country that's going to attain that status. It has
a 245?foot windmill out front currently installed
and operating. It's got a 90?plus thousand square
foot distribution center and it's in the Stockyards
industrial park.

Then Radio Flyer, the last deal we
closed in 2010. So this is a huge renovation of
their legacy facility on the northwest side.
They're putting $14 million into a LEED Platinum
renovation of some unused space they have in their
facility basically making it cost effective and
doable for them to stay in that facility which
they've been in over 100 years instead of just
moving to a more purposeful newer facility. This
is going to be an expansion of their marketing
force that's going to be in this facility.

MR. TUNNEY: Getting back to Testa. What are
the jobs retaining and creating for Testa?

MR. SMITH: I believe it's a retention of
about 90 and the creation of about 30. They also

have a subtenant called Christina Foods that's a

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

10 28AM

10 28AM

10 28AM

minority-owned food company that does a lot of
joint venturing with Testa. We can confirm that 

MR. TUNNEY: My question was Testa.

MR. SMITH: Sure. We'll confirm that number.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: I was out there recently.
It was about 150 total.

MR. TUNNEY: Including this other firm?

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Uh?huh.

MR. SMITH: Instituto Health Sciences Career
Academy, the most recent deal that closed, about a
22.5 million?dollar project. As I mentioned, CDF
sort of split that deal with LISC and provided 12.5
million-dollar allocation towards it.

So this is a 100,000 square foot
charter high school in Little Village. It's the
renovation of an existing building plus a new
construction addition on the north end of the
building. It will be LEAD certified. It's going
to provide college prep curriculum with a strong
health sciences focus. So they partnered with a
number of area health care institutions and
pharmaceutical companies that have hands?on
basically an applied concept for everything they

do. The math class will be health math. Some of

oriented. They also provide adult educational
services there.

Instituto Del Progreso Latino is in
a very cramped facility around the corner, so
they're going to move and expand those adult
training components into this building as well. So
there will be nursing certifications and GED
training for adults as well.

So other projects in CDF's pipeline,
there's 19 total projects currently in CDF's active
pipeline. CDF often hears about a project years in
advance of them being ready to actually close on
financing. So these are various stages of
readiness. So eight of the 19 are in intake phase.
In other words, there's preapplication discussions,
questions about how New Markets can work, that sort
of thing, but the likelihood they will apply.

Eight projects have submitted
applications that are under review, and then three
transactions are in a structuring phase where GDP
is working to find get a comfort level of
capital sources that are adequately there and

adequately configured to work for New Markets. So

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
{312) 781-9586

that totals about 229 million of total financing
that they would be requesting from CDF.

So of those 19, 12 are community
facility, three are industrial, and four are
grocery?anchored retail.

MS. NEELY: Do you have a breakdown of where
they are?

MR. SMITH: No. Sorry. I can try to cross
tab it as a feature for these meetings coming up,
but, no, I don't.

The deal that's on the docket today
for Board consideration is industrial. The two
deals that -- the other two deals that are
structuring, one is a health facility, a federally
qualified health center, and the other is a grocery
project.

The overall status of ODS
allocations, total allocation that's received to
date, 173 million; total closed to date, 131
million. The deal that's on the docket for today
is a 9.5 million~dollar allocation. So if that
deal gets approved, 32.5 million would remain.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Any questions?

MS. SCOTT: From an economic development

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 



10 32AM



10 32AM

perspective, are there benchmarks for how much you
like to see in subsidies relative to job creation?
Are there any rules of thumb? I know this has been
about 50,000 per job created. Is that good, bad,
indifferent, not relevant?

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: It depends on the nature of
the project. As a charter school or community
facility, you're not really looking for the job
creation as much as you are on the industrial or
maybe the grocery store side.

Again, there are community benefit
aspects to each of these projects that you're
looking at. But 30 to $50,000 per job is not
unusual for an incentive program that you would
have such as a TIF underwriting or CDF
underwriting.

MR. SMITH: The proposed transaction today is
Truong Enterprises, which is a minority?owned
produce distribution firm. They currently are at
2550 South Leavitt in leased space, and they will
actually continue to lease that space and build a
new facility to expand the business. So this would
be located at 2300 South Halsted Street. They've

actually purchased a parcel from the City of

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

10 33AM

Chicago at that location. It's in an empowerment
zone. It actually qualifies for New Markets
through an alternate path because there were no
people in the census tract as of 2000, so not
income or poverty based. It's based on the fact
that it's in the empowerment zone, it's surrounded
by other eligible tracks and has more pOpulation.

MS. NEELY: You said it?s minority?owned.
African~American, Latino, Asian?

MR. SMITH: Asian. So their market area is
the entire Midwest, although they do have strong
connections to Chinatown. They actually do
business with Testa Produce, and they've talked
extensively to test out New Markets and get
comfortable with this somewhat strange financing
structure.

And as far as why they need the
financing, the appraisal climate is just brutal for
purpose?built facilities right now. Testa
appraised out at about three quarters of its cost?
The green features were not really recognized as
sort of a value add for financing purposes.

Truong is appraising out at about 70

percent of cost, so that's going to limit what they

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

10: 34AM

10 34AM

10 34AM

10 34AM

can access from traditional debt providers. New
Markets is not really constrained in that way with
its additional 25 percent layers which helps to
counteract that effect.

They also have about $2 million of
dynamic compaction and other site prep they need to
do to the site to make it buildable. It's pretty
significant as a percentage of a 10 million?dollar
project. So those two factors are really creating
the stress that makes New Markets a fit for this
project.

So they provide specialty produce.
They?re actually ramping up their Hispanic?oriented
business. There's apparently a lot of overlap in
terms of the specialty produce that those two
ethnic groups consume. They sometimes just have
different names for it.

MS. NEELY: Cilantro, cilantro.

MR. SMITH: So they would keep their 45,000
square foot existing lease space at 2550 South
Leavitt. They would buy they've already bought
this parcel. They would build this new 61,000
square foot facility and occupy it totally

themselves.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

10 35AM



10 35AM



MS. NEELY: Since they?re keeping their
existing space, the creation of 20 jobs and
retention of 45, how much of that is actually the
45 staying at the existing space and the 20 coming
to the new space?

MR. SMITH: I think some of the 45 are coming
over here. They're very cramped in their existing
facility. All of the new 20 would be located at
the 

MS. NEELY: So that existing space isn?t
going to turn into a blighted area?

MR. SMITH: No. And then there?s additional
expansion potential. There?s another City?owned
parcel adjacent to the one they are buying that
they're at least talking to the City about
purchasing. There's no contract or deal in place
for that yet.

MS. NEELY: And the land has already closed?
The purchase of the land has closed?

MR. SMITH: Yes.

MS. NEELY: And they did finance the buying
of the land or was that 

MR. SMITH: They paid cash.

MS. NEELY: Cash.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

10 36AM

1.0 36AM

10: 36AM

MR. SMITHmore, it's
a pretty conservative company in our experiences
dealing with them. They don't like to promise
things they can't deliver. So I suspect the 20 is
a low number, but we'll see.

They have provided a good breakdown
of what that would be in sales, purchasing, admin,
and warehousing staff with an average of 30,500 a
year in salary fulletime. There would be a
6800-dollar, I believe, value benefit package for
those positions. All would have benefits.

It's not a LEAD building, but it
does have a number of green features. So 10
percent green roof and a 90 percent cool roof that
helps to keep the building from absorbing heat when
it's sunny out. Energy efficient lighting. Very
high~rated insulation which would help a lot in the
freezer/cooler building to keep the energy bills
reasonable, then and an oversized storm water
structure to help reduce the load on the City?s
combined sewer system.

The total project costs 10.?
million. The allocation that's under discussion is

up to 9.5 million. So based on the tax credit

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

10: 37AM

10 37AM

pricing that JPMorgan Chase has offered on their
term sheet, about 2.76 million of net benefit from
tax credit equity. Harris Bank would be the
leverage lender in this transaction. This will be
CDF's third deal working with Harris as a leverage
lender and Chase as a tax credit investor.

This is actually a bit late with
intents of the first time you set a deal like this
up, I think there's a disconnect between who is
providing tax credit equity in the market and who
is actually making loans in the market. It's just
been a response to the capital in the New Markets
environment. But Harris has really learned how to
do this and get comfortable with the indirect
collateral. So they did the Instituto project as a
leverage lender. They did the Greater West Town
project as a leverage lender. They're stepping up
here to do the same thing.

MS. SCOTT: I just want to make sure I
understand it. The 9.5 million?dollar allocation
request, the 39 percent of it is the 2.76 million?

MR. SMITH: 39 percent, and then Chase is
paying 74.5 cents per dollar of tax credit. So 9.5

million times 39 percent times 74.5 percent gets

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 



10: 38AM





2.76.

MS. SCOTT: Okay.

MR. TUNNEY: Say it again.

MR. SMITH: So 9.5 million is the allocation.
So the tax credits would be 39 percent of that.

And then Chase in turn because they?re putting
their capital in up front and they're getting a
benefits credit of seven years is going to pay 74.5
cents for every dollar of that tax credit, which is
actually that's very favorable pricing in this
market. We're seeing a lot of deals at 70 cents
out there.

MS. SCOTT: Okay. And then what's charged
against our allocation is the 9.5?

MR. SMITH: Correct. Yes.

MS. SCOTT: They get 2.76 

MR. SMITH: Exactly.

MR. TUNNEY: I have a question. We're
approving this. There's also an idea that there
might be expansion at the site with another
adjacent City property. So my question is how
strong are they to the leased base on Leavitt?

MR. SMITH: In other words, if they did the

additional City purchase would they be 

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 









MR. TUNNEY: Yeah. Everyone is going to want
to work at the new place. So since you lease, what
is the terms of the commitment staying there versus
we?re going to all move to the new space?

MS. NEELY: That was my question, how
committed were they going to be.

MR. TUNNEY: Do you have any leased terms?

MR. SMITH: I don't. I know just from
looking at their projections that they have rents
going out for the next seven years at least. So
I'm inferring that it's a longer term lease, but I
don't know that for a fact.

So with the phase 2 facility, I
guess that would be a question that the City would
probably pose to them as part of the negotiated
sale application as what happens over on Leavitt.
At least with this facility they will stay open
there, too.

MR. TUNNEY: And the Leavitt side is in a 
or what kind of a 

MR. SMITH: I believes it's, yeah, in the
Little Village industrial corridor.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: GO ahead.

MR. SMITH: So that's the summary on Truong.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 78l~9586

 



10: 40AM

10 40AM



CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Open for discussion and
motion to approve?

MS. SCOTT: What kind of vetting do we do on
the people involved, if any?

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: The ownership?

MS. SCOTT: Yes.

MR. SMITH: CDF doesn't have a specific
process to do that. It's doesn't like run a credit
check. Basically most of CDF's projects have also
run through some other City programs; in this case,
the negotiated sale application for the land, and
then also the tax credit investor and the leverage
lender do vetting on the applicants. So CDF sort
of indirectly relies on that. And they do file an
economic disclosure statement application.

MR. TUNNEY: What is the sale price of the
land?

MR. SMITH: Is about 900,000.

MR. TUNNEY: Of which they paid cash?

MR. SMITH: They paid cash, and that was a
breakdown of 1.82 million against the City's
appraised value.

MR. TUNNEY: Commissioner, if you're looking

for a motion, I'll motion.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

10 41AM

10 41AM

10 42AM

10 42AM

MS. NEELY: I'll second.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Thank you. All those in
favor say aye.

(Chorus of ayes.)

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Thank you. And then we
have one other business item that goes into the
next funding round.

MR. SMITH: So the CDFI Fund announced the
current 2011 competitive round on May 31st.
Applications are due next Wednesday, July 27th.
There's also a QEI allocation of deployment
deadline that's embedded in that. If you've got an
allocation in the prior round there?s always the
threshold you have to hit as far as getting your
old credits out the door. The deadline for that is
October 14th. CDF already met its threshold for
that, October 14. But if it's closed strong, which
is the plan, it will be a little bit more above
those thresholds which I think will help
competitiveness.

Competitive dynamics, so it was a
two?year extension for 2010 and 2011. As I
mentioned, the amount of allocation per year in

that extension got pulled down from 3.5 billion

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

10 42AM

10 42AM

10 43AM

10 43AM

down to 3, which in turn caused the CDFI Fund to go
back and cut back everybody's allocation which they
had already made a decision on late in 2010.

So, in general, a lot of entities
out there are upset they didn't get credits or
they're just disappointed with the size of their
allocations. Anecdotally I'm getting a sense it's
going to be an extremely competitive round.
There's probably more applicants than ever before
with less allocation than there has been in recent
years.

So CDF, for example, got a 18
million?dollar allocation in 2010, which is not a
lot for the scale of what CDF can do. Local
service area allocatees generally got hit very
hard. 18 million was about average for a new tax
CDF.

MS. NEELY: What's the maximum we can apply
for?

MR. SMITH: The maximum is 125 million. Soy
yeah, this is definitely something we want more
input on.

My personal opinion, which I?ll put

out there, obviously subject to the Board's reviews

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

10 4-3AM

10 44AM

10 44AM

that everybody asks for a lot more than they
really can use. And so I think the CDFI fund is
very used to do seeing unrealistic asks and them
cutting them way back. It?s kind of more based on
what on the review of the CDE's activities
rather than what the initial asking amount was.

So one concept that we?re
recommending is asking for 104 million since that's
exactly what CDF has been able to deploy over the
last two years. We would be extremely fortunate to
get half of that amount. But that is a very
supported number. There's no speculation or
projection built into that. That's actual track
record. But, like I said, we definitely want to
hear what the Board wants to apply for.

MS. NEELY: I think that?s a good idea.

MS. SCOTT: Why would we not go to the full
125? I mean, if we know they're going to cut us in
half? I mean, if we have the Board's support.
Doesn't growth seem to be part of the 

MR. SMITH: I mean, I don't think it would be
a bad approach to go for 125. I guess my gut
feeling is that 

MS. NEELY: Have we ever gone for 125 before?

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

10 44AM

10 44AM



10 45AM

MR. SMITH: Yeah, CDF asked for 125 in the
2009 round and asked for 115 in the '06 round.

MS. NEELY: So we've gone max before?

MR. SMITH: Uh?huh, yeah, and that's a
perfectly valid approach for this round. I
personally lean towards the 104 because I
think it just it?s completely credible. There's
no speculation whatsoever. It doesn't create any
kind of impression in the mind of the CDFI Fund
that we're stretching it out beyond what we can do.

MS. SCOTT: What's our pipeline in terms of
dollar amounts?

MR. SMITH: It's about 230 million, so that's
over 2012, 2013. Some of those deals may even look
into 2014. They're fund raising driven community
facilities.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: There's a certain sense
that some of this is a shot in the dark.

MR. Yeah. There's no official
guidance on what they do.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: I should stop here for a
second and give Stacie an opportunity to report
from the advisory committee. But the advisory

committee considered both this matter and the

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 









Truong Enterprises, and perhaps we can talk to what
the advisory committee 

MS. YOUNG: On Truong, we have a couple of
the same questions. I don?t think anything beyond
what you guys discussed.

MS. SCOTT: I mean, do you get brownie points
in heaven on this one for being bashful? Maybe you
do. I don't know.

MR. SMITH: Yeah. There's really no good
information on that. I guess all we have to go on
is last year CDF asked for 131 and got 18.

MS. SCOTT: But had we asked for 104, would
we have gotten 

MS. NEELY: 18.

MR. NAREFSKY: Probably 18.

MS. NEELY: I think we're going to get 18.

MR. SMITH: Probably 18, yeah, but it?s
subject to speculation.

MS. NEELY: I mean, we're definitely not
going to get 104.

MS. SCOTT: No, of course.

MR. SMITH: What they have said is that they
try to evaluate the CDE based on its track record

and its pipeline and give it what they believe to

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
{312) 781?9586

 

10 47AM

10 47AM



two-year supply. And then in the 2010 round
they cut that back, unfortunately, based on the 3.S
billion versus 5. So they just give everybody a
haircut evenly. So, again, that sort of ties to
the 104. That's a two?year supply based on what
we've done in the last two years. Should we go to
a nonround number just 

MS. NEELY: I'll make a motion to ask for
111. DO I hear 113?

MS. SCOTT: The science of that. I'm totally
impressed.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: And I will assume approval.

MS. NEELY: Second it.

MR. TUNNEY: Second.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Thank you. All those in
favor say aye.

(Chorus of ayes.)

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Thank you. Any other
business from the Board?

MR. TUNNEY: No. My only comment is and
it's just for reiteration of what this fund is
about. I think alderman and economic development
jobs are very, very important in retaining and

growing of industries, it seems like there?s a

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 







certain word of mouth in the industrial areas that
this might be an opportunity. And, you know, I
know that health centers and community centers are
very, very important. As chairman of economic
development, though, I definitely think we need to
be accountable for these funds in terms of job
creation and retention and attraction of new. And
the width and breadth of the area we can invest in
is amazing, you know, and that speaks for itself in
terms of what these areas used to be and what we've
lost, you know, for whatever reasons. And, you
know, it seems to me in certain areas where the
land is brought down, there's so many empowerment
zones, opportunities that, you know, I would love
to see a little bit more bias towards industrial
retention and things that really attract, retain,
and grow employee basis. It's just my two cents'
worth.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: And that is actually the
policy of the Board. That was stated last year, I
think, that there would be an emphasis on the job
creating industry; secondarily, grocery stores, and
then community facilities still is an option, but I

think in that order. Am I correct?

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 



10 50AM



10: 50AM

MR. SMITH: Yeah. I think it was also sort
of a nuance in the community facility that CDF
provided a lot of charter school financing and that
it should avoid specializing in that area and keep
it diverse with healthcare, in particular.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Right.

MS. SCOTT: What kind of marketing do we do
with the funds? I assume the banks all know we?re
out there and the banks are our best frontline.

MR. SMITH: Yeah. To some extent there's
also CDF did some initial push with the LIRIs,
Local Industrial Retention Initiative groups,
industrial corridors, and a couple of the
industrial broker associations.

I think it's time for a new round of
that since there's now four deals that have closed
that are really showcase projects and there?s a
whole structuring of this department, probably new
staff that needs to be reexposed to that. So we've
actually worked up a draft flyer for that, but, you
know, brown bags or whatever.

Groceries, CDF participated in a
grocery expo that this department sponsored, and

then also done direct outreach to the major

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
{312) 781-9586

 





10: 51AM

groceries that are active in Chicago.

Healthcare, the health commissioner
introduced CDF to all of the federally qualified
health centers that were doing projects. That
happened about four or five months ago. So CDF
actually got a couple of potential transactions out
of that round of discussions. But, yeah, there's
always more marketing is good. So if there's
any suggestions or anything like that 

MS. SCOTT: I would certainly think the banks
are our front line because they?re the ones talking
to the industrial companies about whether they can
expand or not.

MR. TUNNEY: Well, I just think from a PR
perSpective when these deals are open and running
and there's a big press conference here at Testa or
wherever and, you know, I think that, you know,
that is really, really important.

CHAIRMAN MOONEY: Absolutely. I?m actually
trying to line up the event at Testa now, so maybe
we can do that.

MR. TUNNEY: Because they're in the food
business. They're a household name. Testa is a

Chicago store.
